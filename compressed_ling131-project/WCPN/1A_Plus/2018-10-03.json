love to hear from you to share with you know do you earn the minimum wage right now how much of a difference would Fifteen dollars an hour make in you\nDot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured\nAnd adjusted annually and we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year six to ten employees all skilled gardeners\nI pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support a higher minimum wage we're going to be talking about minimum wage and a living wage let's have Paul San I set the table for a little bit Paul the federal minimum wage\nIs just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress since two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states hew to the seven twenty five\nFederal minimum\n... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's the wages is a little higher but still low or nine dollars are lower\nUm but but uh the other ... you know there's the other Twenty one states have um a you know stock waiting for Congress to act and have have raise the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollars an hour range [noise]\nOne of the the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been ... because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um\nIt's really become irrelevant at the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to rate of raising pay and this is a real issue right now for you know and it's a ... receiving increasing attention you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there's almost no wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rising the rising cost of living\nTo the point the important point that Mr ... and the caller raised about hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage but the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor and improve improve improve pay and our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three Americans\nAre earns less than Fifteen dollars an hour that's um you know forty million workers the median age is thirty is thirty five\nYou know these are overwhelmingly adults who spend their careers in these jobs and it's you know it's it's not it's fast food but not just fast food jobs you know the jobs to make our economy run about you know one wanted for health care workers one in five educators you know huge swaths of our economy\nOf of our workforce you're stuck in these jobs paying less than Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd ... I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wage is is laid down by Congress is almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\nJust doesn't go anywhere in most states in most localities are and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index it essentially to a real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be allowed in number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation ... housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in that district of Columbia they said at the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars\nJust in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers in the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor says the increase ... precarious ness of work that that's also a big problem it despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we heard from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage to try to make it better for workers but when I catch\nUp with a dog in a hotel on land runs the minimum wage and that's never enough\nOn as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job besides my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like we can buy but unfortunately I have lots of the credit card debt and the result and uh actually like Eighteen dollars an hour to twenty four a fulltime job would probably be closer to say Bye bye\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who are living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress a workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on it\nIcing low wages now you're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... or your callers I mean\nActually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states\nOr a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics in just a couple of years\nAnd in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto P. I. N. T. O. on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there like a you know you know in New York and New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs that he's demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what what individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of employees of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year a safety net programs go to a workers in low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a with work supports in order to help bring\nBring workers up to a a a basic level now let's hear some of the other side of the ... rights to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents\nBut then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who are concerned\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at the job on that now I work at ... in the mall but I find that a lot of people\nAre a lot of employers\nIf they're raising the hourly wage or just cutting down hours which in the end it either arrows I'm from the previous\nUh wage or in some cases you make what\nI Am opposed to raising it to Fifteen dollars an hour simply because I don't think businesses will take that last they will raise the prices the standard of living raise and Fifteen dollars won't get anyone any good the poor will stay for\nMichael Saltsman you hear the concerns there it'll raise prices on consumers they'll just pass it along or companies will simply juggle hours to make up the difference and you might get more per hour but you get less hours and you don't come out ahead\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with a bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed

mid career professionals in the fields of business cyber security healthcare and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nLooking back to one a Todd's will agree with you today\nI'm Sorry I understand I I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happen to be in a one eight studios at WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been\nA very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know it\nUh there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the push\nI'm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ... workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the wrestling in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um the the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nUm federally than minimum wage protects workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents technically if you don't make enough tips to bring that\nAh wage up to the the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system um the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up\nIt was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this phone call sector of the workforce Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this\nUh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I\nI think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning I'm In the number of employees who showed up to say this is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those where they're supportive\nAnd I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage and in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips made when am wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees now you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm\nNow that the grassroots workers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business center well so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up\nOr at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and still Mendelson that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got to talk about this which is a he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to meet privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated he said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's\nThat's indicative of where the passion was on this issue let's pull\nFrom the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wages wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates a correct Amazon Wal Mart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop florist those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNow Sara I Want to talk to you about income inequality and wear a minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing\nWhen did the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide any real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent two percent\nIt's meaningful but in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass us Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that his graders and the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Japanese as well as increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top and what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their worker pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information\nTo incentivize companies to to narrow there gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon introduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker paid this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and\nAnd Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland I think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire now that we have this information about gaps within specific ...\nAnd on the ride and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more important part of the conversation you certainly see a lot of pushback from corporate America I think Bernie would be down uh Alexandria or Ocasio Cortez in New York would\nThey down the strong business argument for this there's research that shows narrower gaps are good for business low a lower turnover rates raised worker morale so it's not just people on the left it's enlightened business leaders who should be behind these kinds of efforts\nAcross America are angry and history tells us did now would be a good time to pay attention\nFrom WMU and NPR in Washington this is one a [noise]\nA there are talks will like infer Joshua Johnson today on one ape the power of anger\nWomen everywhere are ditching the advice to play nice instead they're getting mad and using their rage to make social and political

become served Brittany Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new work eloquent rage\nAnd in the studio Rebecca Traister writer of writer in New York magazine and the cut and author of good and bad we want to hear from you to do you think right now is a moment in us history for women expressing themselves\nIn the form of rage and anger you can comment on our Facebook page you can tweet us ... when a you can always email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org and we had been hearing from so many of you want to listeners primarily women\nBut not exclusively Petra emailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger within sanity\nFriends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have\nI have lost my inability to be quiet in the face of gross injustice and Joan emailed us I'm sixty five and I was in college with the first feminist resurgence is the world the usa ready for women's anger that's like asking African Americans when will the world be ready for their anger the answer never\nPower doesn't seed without a fight don't even ask the question the question itself\nIs demanding and peg in Traverse City emailed this on a conservative woman that is angry that someone could be assumed guilty based on unproven allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women are anti cabinet pro choice liberal and progressive I'm a proud American woman who is also concerned\nPicture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment\n[noise] a shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me\nAnd said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had to run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life because I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman saw and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that\nMy anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job or showing up are offering\nQuality lectures are material or material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to our rage and some reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way makes us irrational or makes our claims illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\n'em and more women need to give themselves permission to do that\nI've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying to women out\nOur trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst worth being able to do something about the things we see\nNow what's move from the Senate committee hearing room\nOr in the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have Britain onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment\nThat American shared within the last couple of weeks Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U. S. open here's a cut I'll bring it back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America is arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who founded that anger a weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I ... I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany and Rebecca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history the U. S. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct responses ... there were sponsors of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um\nIt and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nFaith and so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as leaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict\nUm what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so generation of role models\nWho have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as\nUm athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live\nThere were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said marching speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate paraphrasing just because men raging umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulated\nI'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arena conduct I'm as a lifelong tennis fan\nWomen in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters um do when I watch tennis with my friends were African American tennis fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women who are often knocking at the Williams sisters in having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the USPA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated indignities\nAnd then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see them has a referee who accuses her cheating and she's one more grand slams than any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open era and that is indicative of the kinds\nOf theory that we are talking about the ways that women are disrespected daily have\nTheir contributions than their qualifications undermined and men when they finally explode the response is your behavior was inappropriate\nAnd what I Want to challenge folks to think about is not what happened at the moment of the explosion but all of the moments of disrespect or an indignity an injustice that lead to that moment we have to stop thinking about the product of the provocations\nSupport for NPR comes from their station and from the main office of tourism offering traveled there's an opportunity to explore and discover their very own main thing to be inspired the

Bernie Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage\nAnd also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book rage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment\nOf Hillary Clinton into twenty sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoals at how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being very careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America\nAnd in fact it was news in the two thousand ... campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry [noise]\nThe tone of the campaign became [noise]\n\nNot your fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion\nSays I regret how nasty the campaign became a ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's lacking here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter] so she was ... she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um it was ridiculous\nVoice and her facial of parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents but Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift\nThey were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex ... a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough said smile is if it was like some cat cholera on the street smile more\nUm she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that\nWhich was and how during the debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but then she was thinking no no no that's going to redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad\nIt's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about how much energy\nWomen expand modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about\nHow to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us who are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions\nI Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last\n... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of feeding they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras in all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Brittany Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many ... I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah from Cincinnati when I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it it really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something\nI'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable men don't seem to have that same problem and um\nI Am so angry and so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action he hasn't helped to feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that but when they have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a scene there are transferring some of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life for cultural life but into action taking action in the streets taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville\nI'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation of Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect I'm I\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing a that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a title even twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state or the ... Presley campaign\nThey're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I ...\nBut we're particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have the channeling our anger on for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment\nUm but to your earlier point about whether or not our anger can be sustained um I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project\nA sense a depending on how you count eight seed thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know I'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think that as women see that um our power in our ability to frame issues in ways that include the most Americans and take care of the most marginalized Americans\nUm I I'm I'm excited about a blue wave of what I what I Hope though is that folks start to see that even if you don't care a lot about presidential politics I'm Down ballot races really matter that local races really matter um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "03"}
