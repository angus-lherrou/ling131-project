X. dot com or from an agent Hitchcock's insurance encourage courage [noise]\nIs one a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum the Democrat running for governor in Florida this year we welcome your questions and thoughts for mayor Gillum\nBut to hear from some of you across the state of Florida about what you're looking for from the next governor Larry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum over a member of the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the greatest parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our states\nLarry that is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power and knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy return to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nAre to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return that we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nUm is of no consequence there Floridians and they were part of a of our state they is often been\nForgotten forgotten cos would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to define in economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida before\nAdd one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier is about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach it basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around\nAnd levels as climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing and homes and weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that as governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point\nHas to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here you know it's it's such a fair\nPoint on and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and lie to the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increased storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well less than\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk\nFor having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real estate why conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise and climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for property to be built and to be built and frankly in an unreasonable way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out with these increase storm of events\nPart of the state we would be having to begin this conversation I think is going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're going to have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda senses to take part in this discussion or a future discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly love to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it and mayor again thank you are or appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the W well around listening area including Palm Beach Broward in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing parties in control of the two chambers\nWell one Luis good to hear your voice again uh um it to 'em and well aware and thankful for your mind to have the early voting we actually has some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami\nFor early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI'm I mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money and model\nWilling and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy ...\nUm he and I spent some time together for two years or making our way through 'em in Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm convinced them to believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we began from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will\nUm were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars for health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party\nOr with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part is and you know squabbles they want to make sure that we\nCan produce and and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you have been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville uh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you make criminal justice reform\nOne of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with a law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nI mean so first I mean a a shape it a shape that a lot I think if if you recall from\nWhen you know the the cop would come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um ... that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience and I remember deciding at a very early age that I never wanted to see that expression on my mom's face because of something that I did\nUm and so I Am the first to my seven siblings to graduate from high school and as the fit the seven kids and the first to graduate from college when my brother got home after doing his time um I watched him want to be a better father for his daughter and a better partner or to his girlfriend and then to his wife [noise]\nUm and he went and apply for a job to job at the job and got told no after no after no and it really did shake my belief that listen how can we say we want people to pull themselves up by the bootstraps\nTo redeem themselves to reintroduce themselves into society when we then create all of these barriers that keep them from being able to do just that\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote

checklist but retired General Stanley McChrystal says that search may give you some convenient answers but\nThe truth is much more complex his new book explores the paradoxes of being a leader who do you look to in your life as an example of great leadership what impact have they had on you and what do you think makes them such a good leader leave us a voice mail eight five five\nLook to as an example are of leadership and why tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or use our app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Louis Hernandez of double you all are in public radio and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get another question for the mayor\nNo definitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this lord as one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that ... sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting\nWith black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election\nYeah I mean I think we are doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate a across frankly all communities\nUm I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump one button thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nI'm I'm ... I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... doll\nEr which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us is that in a primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand voters turned out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and\nThat number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins is the one who get one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there\nWill go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor deal in so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners press will have a chance to talk to you again but one more a matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... to make two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation miracle\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already have castle doctrine which allows for individuals to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders 'em up on their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be clear the difference between what you're talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you referring to basically is that kind of your home is your castle idea of it says you have the right\nTo use deadly force to defend yourself at home are worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened in any where you have a legal right to be just to be anywhere yeah I\nDecision or about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home\nThere's already comment last self defense which means and places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force\nThere is already case law on the books where you've been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different ditched dream and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that\nI Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how families like mine in like others who are raising black children I'm In black and brown children feel particularly\nI'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and the trace of Martin the case of marquee smug locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies because they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover\nOr for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... years as stand your ground as a fan of\nFans who writes for before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones will just sit around and\nI Would say one yes we must enforce a currents\nIt's like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these are radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't you guys in parts for our kids play in our in our family picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment\nWas simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was thought them decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nGillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate your making some extra time for so thanks very much thank you

U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one Hey Scott let's get some definitions out of the way first of all when we say collective bargaining what are we referring to\n[noise] uh when we say collective bargaining or what we're talking about our negotiations between uh employers and a group of employees are on salaries benefits working conditions and the like and typically employees are represented by unions\nKind of basic wages and working conditions exactly now a number of states have a right to work laws on the books are they're called right to work states what exactly do we mean by right to work\nSo a right to works a states and there are about I think twenty seven twenty eight of them now are they prohibit labor unions and employers from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment uh and of course a union dues are\nExtremely important because that enables the unions to not only um conduct the negotiations during collective bargaining but also a to engage in other activities um including a political activities\nSo if you are at a job at a a union covered workplace typically you know what I mean in a non right to work state\nYou get that job and you join the company and they say hey welcome to this job recovered by union here's your initiation fee you need to pay in a right to work state you can get the job and say no thanks I'm not eager to pay for this but I look forward to starting work that's right\nHow does union membership look in the U.S right now are we talking mostly about public sector workers like teachers more private sector workers like hotel workers some of whom are on strike right now what's the overall picture\nSo uh this picture has changed dramatically in the last several decades\nOverall has declined significantly over the last several decades and now public sector employees make up a larger share of a unionized workers in the United states so right now about a third of public sector workers and we mean we say public sector sector workers we're talking about teachers police officers firefighters\n\nBathing dressing meals and light housework nationwide visiting angels America's Choice in senior home care office locations are visiting angels dot com\nFrom constant contact who's segmentation feature allows small businesses to deliver personalized email campaigns to connect with their customers learned more at constant contact dot com and from the ... e Casey foundation\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson this summer the Supreme Court ruled that public sector employees have a First Amendment right not to pay union for collective bargaining unions called this unfair because non union workers benefit from the contracts that can reach through collective bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue states solve this decision coming in preemptively pass legislation to protect unions from the high court's ruling were discussing that and more issues related to state laws on unions with Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line Sarah Duncan is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she has a K. through eight visual arts teacher\nWe love to hear from you about what your state is doing with regards to unions and right to work laws and rules comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Sarah there was one more thing I did want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in grants that I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nA member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiations or us on our Affleck salary health insurance all that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level\nYou know that sometimes wants teachers or to send your that's negotiated underneath the union contracts but were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher marketer and ultimately compare ourselves through other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with a series I Wonder what you think of John's commented museum appoint the unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that um first off\nI've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers the union is not just your union leaders union movements are driven by numbers and lenders need to demand\nAnd ... you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices um it's actually not\nThat difficult to fire a teacher but what unions have done is made it clear that you can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or\nYou know and part of the reason that's so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nI let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of\nThey've made it then I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are I'm not evaded and I do believe that that is why the strike was ...\nWe could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our community is realize\nYou know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it up a or just about healthcare it's not about that not just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and\nI had seen with my own eyes legislators are pitted late putting the interests that outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate your making time for us thanks very much thank you without a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair or equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually negotiating just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union correct me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want\nBut a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions\nThen the sort of um uh\nUh differences that you're talking about I Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on down on drugs now and she's joining us NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in and Barry ... district and I hope she makes it one of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also contract I actually I don't really contracts I should also introduced Vincent for new CIO he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on Vincent ... she's me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save views or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor not a ceiling it\nDepends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good concept ... a context for folks maybe who never been in the union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage may vary Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house oh well that's right\nAnd get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions anything they could before right to work for ... sake you negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired and going back to that contract is a a floor and not a sale like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those are the public sector\nHave seniority built in or the only way to get a raise is by logging another your other job you know hey I'm ... and all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nThat allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union worker if workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff to negotiate for you right Vincent [noise]\nUh the problem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or not a human\nWhen I hear you on that piece I just want to make sure we're clear on the argument you're making if the staff to to go shoot your contract he's paid and there are workers who choose not to pay into that staff how could that not have an impact I mean you got to pay these people right\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Fidel investments taking a personalized

will share some of your stories if you're lucky tomorrow on one day back\nNow to our conversation with Scott Greenberger Randi Weingarten and Vincent for a new show before we keep going Scott there was a statistic you shared earlier that I think he wanted to clarify just to make sure we got it right yeah I just wanted to\nClarify that according to federal statistics are more than a third of public school teachers police officers firefighters are and and other government workers where union members um as of two thousand Seventy\nSo not just those jobs were covered by unions are in your membership gotcha great thank you very much clarify that Randy you wanted to react to counties voice mail from Ohio Go ahead\nGray and my apologies that by a battered stuff that I think you overheard\nAll are given it as you\nSaid look you know I Know we live in a world where you know truth and fact no longer seem to matter but let me just throw out a couple of things what kinda was saying is that and the privates the privatization in Ohio lead to less safety\nTo it's a huge issue in the Ohio governor's race right now because this virtual charter called he caught meaning\nUm a charter that said it was I'm serving Twenty one thousand kids fleece the tax payers of\nOhio by somewhere between a hundred million to a billion dollars and the wind evidently was the attorney general during this period of time and didn't take this issue seriously and Cordray is making it a big issue and people are really upset about it\nI think that what happens is that unions sometimes look we we become the voices people and people on the other side don't like it sometimes like the divorces like the Koch brothers\nBut it is the difference between being stronger together which is what county was saying\nVersus going it alone and and people who are rich can go it alone most of us can't and that's why frankly union membership and my union is up in the last ten years by about two hundred and fifty thousand people because people feel stronger together even when we all kind of debate\nAt our conventions what our policy should be it has to be democratically based and it\nHas to be about the value of what we do for not only are members but for kids\nWe heard from some of our listeners about membership going up indeed Jacob emailed I'm an ... shop steward with local one twelve and an employee with the state of Maryland post genocide we've seen very few members opt out and in fact we appear to be seeing more interest in our union\nRandy I Wonder if we could back up to something that Vince ... said earlier up a point that he made in terms of being required to pay versus having the desire to pay you know I you know I work as the host of this program and this is not work that I Would do for free\nBut the the plurality of the work that I Do is funded by the public discourse\nRahman or we have of whether we're doing what people want to use their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write a similar wills to donate their cars to be you know cash now to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks and right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nThey get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loans see or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case about forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it\nWill be the case there Janice overturned\nExactly so but look Janice that Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court has wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest\nFoot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to defend us however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since is that members have stuck with the unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was\nOr Scott there which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide tastes sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher and ten states if we we if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a chance to respond to them then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus Ashby case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my say dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under ...\nI'm In some cases in credibly confusing time periods on some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while\nSo what you mean by captive audience ... what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well recent\nLegislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think a time share presentation on steroids were the union can come and\nSay this is why you have to join put a dues check off for a more a membership form in front of them say you have to you know here's why you really should sign up\nAnd there is no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all these efforts these educational efforts around the country saying no to know your rights\nAnd by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit\nWhen you can exercise your rights I'm this is what it is and shares help navigating that often confusing process and that process that may confusing on purpose to keep public employees trapped\nI Want to move on from ... to to see if we can move on and go a little bit further forward in terms of\nWhat the future legislative landscape for this may be I Will say that I have done union covered worked in the state of California before and I never went through anything that felt like a time share presentation I think people's mileage Scott will vary depending on what that on boarding meeting is like well", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "22"}
