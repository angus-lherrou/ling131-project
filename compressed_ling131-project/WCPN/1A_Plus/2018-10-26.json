A. M. U. dot org\nAdam or go see a before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set beliefs\nHow do we break out of this show people that does you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter]\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a niece that very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and work perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are I Am personally kind of amazed at that and more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths\nOf these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fun\nDifferences forever and what we believe that but I think\nThat the increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then he was the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go I mean I\nBecause of because I'm a report I talk to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nIn Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show\nOr not just our fans are critics listened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one aid to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post so much how do you know what it was printed there to criticize it yeah and\nQuite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most\nFrom the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it um and it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging us who don't want us to do what\nIt is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we all need criticism or the media needs to be criticized we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nWe're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of the story over the weekend you please just remember the stories moving really really fast\nWe're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions about what has happened there already been some details of the story that hadn't been clarified a walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this\nKeeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org ...\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is response\nBruce Lee mass referring to the the congressional baseball game which Republican Congressman Steve ... of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories in the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly much no but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen\nThat wants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much [noise]\nYou know it's sort of became a\nNationalist and I say really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nDo you think Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nAnd neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a ... it's just someone who put America First um\nBut the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context of nationalism knows that it is a world view embraced on other rising I met has led to um you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself or from a basis that would give them\nA campaign I'm really distance himself from the term nationalist when we saw a Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because ah the ... the form of nationalism that was most are familiar with a band and in the bribe our community west vat of white nationalism which we've seen um\nYou know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic\nTo see Trump embrace it um while misrepresenting it or put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I'd love to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriots\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic give us parse the words parts of the language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his ... secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird\nWill die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth that is right in front of us\nI think a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has a really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide and a World War Z I'm On the other hand I don't I think that some people\nWas an argument that President Trump is functionally a white nationalist in terms of his rhetoric in terms of his policies that that's an arguable point um but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist he said I'm a nationalist anti is manifestly so I don't get why this is a big deal\nA few of your comments about President Trump's word choices Mary hail emailed when Trump recently called for unity she did so in a tone but it's clearly not his usual one it is as if he was saying to his followers I don't mean this but they're making me say at his actions and words soon after showed that he really didn't mean it\nMichael emailed I've been hearing a lot about President Trump's rhetoric in regards to this bomb scare what about the calls for action by leading Democrats such as Maxine Waters the chicken when they go low and harassed them in public crowd\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from CSP certified financial planner professionals committed

roundup conversation with Cassie Adam and Eugene using this is not the first time the Trump Administration has targeted the transgender community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the courts\nOf reality start Caitlyn Jenner published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by age or just in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he is insulted our dignity this is politics at its worst unquote\nNow usually we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of conservatives are not very trans friendly but she appreciates it leads to being in the room and being able to talk to them about trends issues\nI also had to push back on her a little bit 'cause she knows that people in the room clearly do not want her there\nWhat do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just kept you know it's been really\nFascinating she uh is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by the transgender rights community because uh she does not seem to be deeply ...\nShe likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has tried to be at the table before her um and and that the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps\nA for not a being a a boat advocate of the trash under a community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that\nOne of the things I'm most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different ah identity groups can listen to the same candidates and walk away with different things in general wrote in that Washington Post op ed that seat back Trump because she heard him\nInclude algae beats the communities and has a speech at the Republican National convention and she saw people applaud and so she thought he would have bad algae beats he writes\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it's just one of those amazing moments in about how different Americans here different things\nGet to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sitting in for sex centers routinely used as such on birth certificates it seems that when we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nKirk I'll take this one on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do was identity sexuality has to do with who you see yourself with\nGender has to do with who you see yourself as one more story related to the ... community today the remains of Matthew Shepard are settled in their final resting place at the Washington National cathedral shepherd was brutally murdered Twenty years ago in the opt in\nOh for many Americans to violence against el GB teach you people today's ceremony drew hundreds to the cathedral for a musical event that included several of shepherds favorite songs including imagine by John Lennon\nLet's get to some more of your comments including about the refugee care of and and to be clear I think I misspoke earlier and said that the care of and as a possibility that campaigns real the troop plan is real it is possible that the care of and might not get to the border by May of misspoke when I brought that up Bryan emailed\nIs this column of potential immigrants really such a big deal it's not like they're trying to sneak in they're coming up to knock on our door to ask for help sounds like they're following our rules\nAnd tweeted can we please start calling the care of and what it is a group of refugees fleeing communities destroyed by two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S had a hand\nAnnoyed now has lots of you were commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there irrepressible youth tweeted a quote from George Orwell nationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump to use the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American\nAnd Matthew tweeted or mess tweeted equating nationalism with white nationalism seems akin to the right rounding socialism up to ... both sides are talking past each other more and more and demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose a new ten percent tax cut for the middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election\nKathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms or whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nThat I hate to say this but I don't think he has a plan\nThat that he promised I don't think it's helped middle class people as was promised the first time so maybe this is an effort to do so it's an effort to get ... voters out for this election and I asked them how do you see it\nI don't think that we should even be talking about it on a news program until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy there's of everything about this is just so an serious I'm right now\nAnd I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit by even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four thousand people marching from uh the northern triangle countries' interests uh bought them all in all Salvador um through Mexico hoping some of them hoping to reach the United states\nThis does not represent any kind of significant uptick in the number of people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happen to be in a big group it's more a reflection of a change in strategy among people trying to make that journey whereas previously they had tried to do it\nOr in small groups to try to uh not be noticed um that made them vulnerable to all kinds of hazards along the way and so there's a new strategy to try to go in ... openly in one big group that's all that's going on here border patrol apprehended\nUm about a hundred and fifty thousand people from the northern triangle countries in twenty Seventeen that's just the people that they caught right this is not a significant number of people and therefore I'm not even sure that we should be talking about it that much it we should be talking about the broader ...\nOnce they're in the first place both from you know from Nineteen eighties proxy wars with Russia funding civil wars there to drug policy today that's the bigger issue the caravan is not the big issue and I don't I'm not sure we should be talking about it I'm Sorry I just got us off a truck\nClear now but ...

President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out to apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOf their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle\nA and have children and have better lives than simply and and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump P. N. and and I guess Republican rhetoric that play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as\nThey think about and I also do want to point out a car ruined mentioned that President Trump alluded to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern as a slower of sorts\nWhich which we ... we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\n... that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation there but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of of Middle East and as the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it ... van tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as carbon was pointing out again a movement that happens very often or you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here in the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful\nWith language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help a cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge pleased\nNot migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the English language\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know just it just it was as you've been talking about this I I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were cold deportees it's a beautiful song you you look it up and ... ... listeners who should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions of it\nYeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we have a human wave coming out of sub Saharan Africa and the horn of Africa towards Europe and it it's headed destabilizing effect on politics or as well\nAnd and I I Would identify most of these folks as as being migrants as opposed to people who come from countries which\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance offering a way to my home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rates are available on line learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nFrom fidelity investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more at fidelity dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services El Al ...\nAnd from the William T grant foundation at W T grants foundation dot org\nWe get back to the round up we would love your help with next week's discussion on voting specifically early voting lots of Americans are casting\nTell us why and tell us how it went eight five five to three six one a one and you can leave us a voicemail there now if you're not voting early we'd like to know why not did something get in the way of you voting maybe you just prefer going on election day for some reason\nTell us how early voting is going where you live and whether you took part in it\nEight five five to three six one a one eight or you can use our app won a vox pop to send a radio quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics you can download won a vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P. in your store and we'll share some of your stories on Monday\nOn one day\nBack now to our discussion with current emergent of the Washington Post ... ... of foreign policy magazine and Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast rub you let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message\nOf Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often and the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex to the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't say in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's that's because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the er the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both thought\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some ... some farm is is on its way it's coming and so\nAt some level of the other they have all endorsed\nLet some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it will then tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to trying to pick to be one of the ah the tech support as a of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's this\nEdu area law that protects the privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside you if you've noticed in the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we may be tracked your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups\nOn those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nAfraid of this month juicy under parliamentary privileged to blame for the green as the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of a story which is clearly in the public interest\nWas the voice of lord pain or Baron the hand of nice in the British house of lords using British problem\nHi this is what makes this such a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of it just wrote it in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in parliament that you can't say outside and and not so for any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThis this guy or for the green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to by Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy and indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of ball she would expect you as a bully and he was\nHe sexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up\nThere were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details or can't get because of these nondisclosure agreements but at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nYou know and moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and like what [laughter] what do you do it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to fly to have that that this this question of like which is the greater good here right because this is at the meeting than it already then a question is can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against that\nAnd I'm In Flint is able to get away with it it it kind of the perfect I'm ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of values protecting more is it the reputation of the accused in this way where India is can be applied newspapers that were never a party to them or is it getting this out in the public space and said he was like an extra level in the u._k.\nOf determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how should it be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections will Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they have to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in this second round of voting\nFernando ... on the left ... is on the right in ... the lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondents for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nWell Booker has been a congressman for her a couple of decades now and I agree with you come to the phone will last for\nParticular letter saying that that are more for days at a tiny scurry ... comment and a winning and are minorities and they burn and go on and that wasn't going to\nBurn a provocative reputation that a lot of people who come on otherwise known as ... ... acre acreage so um it it could have an open all over the week up as an outsider\nOn track\nSo is that why he is so popular I mean you know that Brazil has had a number of issues that\nKind of a cascading issues with corruption over the years has just kind of she's outsider status has eclipse any social misgivings or maybe about him\nI don't know if it's kind of um I Know that he would\nUm Ramon quote ... when I heard about a year last week on high end the call but everyone looks at it I think that anyone if it'd be kind of gloom wants contracts\nFor what we saw in the first round of um of ... there were around that guys when they put it on ... called controls on I'm not I'm not a credit more moderate climate and voted out a lot of a kind of tiny\nCountry of course going on and on and and then I'm going to be on pro you know ... for NATO or for the um the sky and the ... don't have that courage their weapons and then the other party that Governor in Brazil for 'em or clean or as a while", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "26"}
