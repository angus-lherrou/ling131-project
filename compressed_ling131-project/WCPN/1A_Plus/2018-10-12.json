Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week uh talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the IPC set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it for a very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to\nImpose a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment from your comments on this not my column retweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point to me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not pushing the credibility that's kind of a drug deal on this program but I hear what you're saying [noise] Leary tweeted\nIn hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you hard in your home and if you want to live in Florida that as he Faisal risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there\nYou just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the talented and incorporate it it's it's a tough one\n[noise] no it is a really tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to\nA community is close to the coastline dorm or talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurviving ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take her that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just to and if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought and conflict\nShips between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish your core speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us\nOne a at W.

A. M. U. dot org touch well look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh confirmation go it seems to have had\n... affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put to provide so around what I'm about to face\nWeeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like Tennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state actually had\nA chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat to now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January\nThey will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like a shame said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee or rather the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask ten twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior to tears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up their church\n... all activists you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee where she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this says supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection you can bet that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd my thing I'll say it she just last night um was trying to take the fight from you know on this ... thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in from outside the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and Trump\nAre tempted menace rations really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave California politics before the roundup is up but a few more things out to DC we wanted to discuss including the president stepping in the middle of the feud\nBetween Taylor Swift and Tony west he publicly just miss swift for endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee but he woke I'm telling you it was to the White House yesterday\nConnie wore red make America great again hats\nWhen in fact I don't want to put you in that spiraling by love this guy here let me give this\nI Love this guy right\nNow ... was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he had noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it I\nNot either I mean I could see was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on another ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to to the deep end this like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there is a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it but a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but his\nA strange moment and I know for for for for me and my heart just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note that ... old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British in has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically sent hit men to kill them all to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened right well what\nRight now is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove Fletcher mark a shaggy who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or heard it themselves but there's a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress and the White House\nIs it politically difficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime and Saudi Arabia I'm Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince\nOf Saudi Arabia and I broke a story earlier this week that before ... he went missing been so mine had actually ordered an operation to trying to lure him back\nWhat happened to ... turkey says the Saudis sent shipment to killed his outspoken journalists the Saudis denies that\nWho's telling the truth\nFrom W.

uh in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure there are then reports that they were to go ... jets that came from Saudi Arabia\nOr with fifty men them they they go into a blackout er vines are drove to the ... so the consul general's residence which is allegedly where show he may have been taken and they did what they did to him now there are reports that collecting that attacked U.S intelligence have proof\nOr this or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered and I met the most brutal brutal debts\nNow we know that the the planes that were those two movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to Riyadh\nWho was on them will that designation was within the state type of racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the Turkish are telling the authorities here\nA ... you will thirties here in the U.S understand he's not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that that has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded I Know what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep under the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... quit I miss definitely falls into that category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies any press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to she'll use disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're lucky again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nBecause she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we don't like it John widow like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four\nOr five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday in ... referring to evade human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military\nCase fits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia [noise] especially in light of the comment that I read earlier a re read it chest sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nAnd there is no reason to maintain close ties with a country that has more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing\nIs killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared cush there would be banned from any policy making\nLaw the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's it's really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have been arguing for a long time just as the commenter said I'm\nNow we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy you know how to cut you short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nThink that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that ah and Leslie\nBe voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was a Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead so I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war\nIn Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that that the U. S. trumping ministry and have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I wanted there is a counterpoint to that which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of set the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because\nWe have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we have always seen them as a strategic ally not as the values based allies in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump Senate and particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what us presidents have said quietly for a long time\nSure sure if I could chip in the last ... here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime minister such that it could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still that was about to be concluded\nOn the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into what Saudi Arabia or had been doing and whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nA ... and you know it was clear that the Saudis said to Blair you've got to call this the core off the dos otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually mercifully countries especially Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation and he used his power as prime minister\nWell Trump you know one of the first places he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however they they are there are there and do trapeze determines the arms deal will go ahead\nJosh before we keep going and oh I was just\nGoing to say if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace down as you recall last month that the UN\nAt the United states has pretty aggressive in calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion um shape it's reaction or lack there of 'em to chew what's happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if in fact is the case that they have\nKilled a journalist inside their conflict who is it a resident of the United states\nSpeaking of journalists who have been killed there is another journalist\nBeing remembered today in Bulgaria at a funeral the body of thirty year old TV host Victoria marine over was found over the weekend you're the Dan River in northern Bulgarian town she had been raped\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bona certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and customer service contract or low cater and more information or at Boehner dot com [noise]\nFrom capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one in a\n[noise] and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR's\nStill time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the week's top stories as well one a ass W. A. M. U. dot for\nThe story of the president of Interpol Ming hungry who's reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Meng the ex Interpol president's wife\nHe's speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened nephews have do we have a sense that you know of why this is going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government or what this means for the larger sense\nWell he's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the Shia government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalty said their suggestions certainly is that somehow he was less than loyal and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been ah she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use 'em up public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband it's it's\nThe nation when he shot to the top of the rings he nearly took the election with forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth where we Freidman can you remind us who joy ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nHe's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades um he is a law and order candidate that his his big thing so he says you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he is very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first\nUm and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to losing gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae beauty and one other thing that's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy in Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was a law and order one other point to know is that he had an armored but Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations ah\nYou know be nationalistic and be about cracking down on crime and he has promised to be a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government or there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse come to the right wing view is\nThat he espoused is so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean in deep recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption um crisis or that affected all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his that was hit a winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic wrote an article and\nWho else is going to fix this mad and I think that that is that is the sentiment that it's worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment inbred that and Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries\nIn the world glad to hear from some Brazilians who are listening and today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm and I'm a Brazilian listening from a city next to Brazil's capital Brasilia\nI'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which is also racist massages and homophobic\nSince last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both so NATO supporters social media specifically what's app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with both an out of our democracy is at risk John ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this for the last\nPoll I saw suggested yes that the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... sedan that had died and so I kinda think that you'd have to say that it's eight with that sort of ... of that right it's got to take some quite something for the left is kind of candidate to come back from that position\nUm I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both NATO it he was stabbed in September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence round about his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates but I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting ready for this stopping that I had ... I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about\nThat the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they see that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss ... use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country could say it's not a big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact on something that needs to be dealt with aggressively in of course the kinds of changes that this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that it demands sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nations are already seen\nAnd you know as a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of wars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm\nYou know it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly at uh\nThat this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences just sure I was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out\nAnd I on the main national news shows the kind of half an hour long for the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes with devoted to decide PCC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean that's one of the things that really strikes me about living here ... ... in America where you get more was a I think the square inch than any other\nKind of country on the planet or you know huge amount about whether the climate is not discussed\nAnd that is one of the things that really strikes me whereas I think there's a much greater consciousness whether they're doing that much about it is another issue but I think that you know I Am struck by how a lift all this ... the national debate a compared to in other parts of the world and\nJudge said one thing to that I spoke with the un secretary general Antonio ... recently right before the U.N General assembly and asked them what is the greatest threat do you face right now what does your greatest challenge I expect him to say a voting and disruption with the United states or the conflict in Syria", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "12"}
