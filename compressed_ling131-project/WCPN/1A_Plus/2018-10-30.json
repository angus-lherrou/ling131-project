A. M. A. U. dot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is report Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happen to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth and so a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nSo we actually are seeing an increase over last mid term\nIt's across the country during presidential election so if we are comparing to twenty fourteen Tony fourteen we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred and Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd I'm more expected this morning we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day on election day and um it's a it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots in\nAnd Brian grim it what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know\nAh there's they request in in one of the most populated county Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through how this Kansas handle voting early\nIt depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um obviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common\nAn ugly or open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas or we've had to early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it I'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who'd like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado how's ... how does early voting work\nWell basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here to Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to ...\n... um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado a but not everyone um you know that ... it ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nGlad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting\nOh it is for your three states but in every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just a day but your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day and not a postal carriers hands on election day got to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to live in a vote early and Michigan\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say should be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is maybe due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot ... what is being over sixty has to do with\nVoting early ah possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays\nI liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home amen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big\nAs I think one if not two of the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of the it was a ridiculously fit died and it just took a little time to go through so I hear you on that Tracey is listening from Texas and Tracy emailed", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "30"}
