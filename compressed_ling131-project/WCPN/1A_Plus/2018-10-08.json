in North Florida who tweeted we'd better vote\nLike our lives depended on it in November and not let anything go to the Supreme Court if we can possibly help it\nSharon emailed I was behind judge Kavanaugh from the beginning of his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed that he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media seeks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn rode on our Facebook page you can't soft sell this anymore which unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the right didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John wrote investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the evidence she or a question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court or you know preponderance like ... set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seemed to be more believed than others what did you make of that\nIt's two completely different world views so when Democrats um both parties in Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges of sexual assault us and take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and ah and to the president himself and so forth so that's their view um the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation a of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the processes um I Know this was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the lazy forward one was taken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the\nLaugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in a in in that says to Maryland and the Nineteen eighties and to the students that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks have girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and refused to publish it\nSo um so so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of\nColored sweat Nick and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with Boise for it's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um making sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker\nMay have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues will\nThe president did also make some political have wish Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and he's unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars are generous word what professor Ford said to ...\nHow did he get home I don't remember how you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many I don't want to I don't\nKnow [noise]\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know\n[noise] I don't I don't know what I Wonder if that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nAnd I live in a man who lives just shattered\nPart of what the president said at his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor for to remember was having one beer indeed she said that seared into ... campus clearly a psychology professor was the fact that she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things the president did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking her and diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and a driving uh people uh from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of um absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know ... ...\nAt some point in his adult life well and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that amount of early on I also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh that seemed to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis that didn't get a lot of the nation from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that what fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving towards hearing if you haven't heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful but I Know I Do not do\nI think I Would hope that it would be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a\nLousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged on Democrats sort of\nTheir their arguments a became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but that he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered intern that Democrats have said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective\nBut ... says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president to a point that based on the way they ruled so the temperament question was interesting I'm not sure how relevant it is because we know all the politics of all the justices not really sure how cabinets temperament plays into it\nWith regards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the Thomas and Kavanaugh hearings referring to Clarence Thomas back in Ninety One Thomas required sixty votes to confirm Kavanaugh only fifty fifty plus one\nThere's no need for civility for the majority anymore because there's no need to have at least some support\nFrom both sides you know what do you make a simple Thomas did not require sixty votes to confirm but if you did not require succeeded\nNot at we've never required sixty votes to confirm or he may have required sixty votes to proceed to the vote baton Clarence Thomas did not get sixty votes\nWork support for NPR comes from the station and from the main office of tourism offering travelers an opportunity to explore and discover their very own

and motive Sharon ... let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comment before we could go\nA little early on I mentioned that that Republicans I suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in the political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen that's a dangerous business\nUh but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's had twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of boy moms who are are really scared about the standard that and know what I mentioned right the idea that as single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized taken out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us and wrote we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time when one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel is talking about or justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boils ... are we losing sight of ...\nThere's been human civilization\nAnd I've started when I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment\nThe comics wrote that one in four women in America to deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a yet\nOr not race that that that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against your will so right over with a number yeah\nOkay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization all civilized society seek to cope with it [noise]\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice in fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nFeel like well this is one of those moments early on and there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show is a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that ...\nWell we will shut you down until you do I hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier and I I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get\nBetter [noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised and it was should he a\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should uh have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that uh there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that\nA ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court by should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of a reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nMy name is far I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed jak and our congressman and I'm very disappointed with the United states and\nAll right doors and said okay let's get the country a good show they already know what they were going to do it's not a government by the people Oh yes it is only up to take killer group of people\nFor pre shirts calling and sharing your thoughts with us when we get to a few more comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined that is absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court\nHer life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined the me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll Kavanaugh really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right or some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate in a statement this gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote for\nBrett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with\nPresidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nAt him because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some aren't cleaning\nUm I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrow in at the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester\nKavanaugh's moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was as a judge on the ... he was following Supreme Court\nPrecedent his job as a judge was try to guess how the Supreme Court would rule on a particular issue given the process that now that he is setting that President needs crater on what he thinks that precedent should be\nUm I I Do think something that's under covered we we may now have I don't think that we have the votes on the Supreme Court to overturn roe versus Wade I Do think that we had the votes on the court potentially can narrow something called a Chevron precedent\nMid

fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington hill method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then that does the the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways\nOr some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various courts here and there\nAre and the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the points\nAbout a year later and in the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that\nWhere the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we are going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting second\nYear in North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David you're in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states is a Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington that Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state in the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no\nOh at the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that\nDemocrats may often when more votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority in in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build a wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience is hottest taught us topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active\nWhile back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference\nBetween the map of gerrymandered district and the ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the word gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. B. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find it on our website the one a doc Ford\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that twenty sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really are being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders on what these messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\nI realized that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about gerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't heard or that popular a proposals aren't being passed at the local level\nAnd we're lucky in Michigan where we have the citizen lead ballot initiative process which means if we can write constitutional language as the people in Michigan and then gather a this last round three hundred and Fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty four registered Michigan voters signatures\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from love me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform allowing people to connect around the globe to get work done learn more it go to meeting dot com\n[noise] from lumber liquidators suffering flooring installation nationwide with new styles of hardwood and would look waterproof flooring more lumber liquidators dot com or one eight hundred to two seven four zero three six [noise] and\nTime tomorrow will be a conversation about how we all have at work\nChances are that you have worked somewhere that made you feel like you had to be perfect show no fear never screw up and avoid asking for help\nNot the easiest working conditions but what else is there research or ... brown argues that the same kind of empathy we seek in our personal lives should carry over to our workplaces if we want to do our best\nWe would like to know if you have ever worked somewhere like that a company where you felt safe to be yourself\nYour whole self\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five\nTo three six one a one day how much are you able to be yourself at work\nDoes your company feel like a safe place to just be human or do you have to arm or up before you clock in everyday tell us your story\nEight five five to three six one a one a or you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a high quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics we will share some of your stories when Bernie brown joins us in Studio tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Katie face he's a founder and executive director of voters not politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill\nA couple of you wrote us to respond to lower its message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election mark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle\nSteve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures\nLook at the old seventh congressional district thankfully the ...\nAnd Donald Duck facing one another's seriously just Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion\nWorld he sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com this is they say\nGerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts the north Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about the role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page\nI live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantage but what what what do we know well\nThe Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and the ... the ... Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates\nBack in twenty Seventeen the way originally elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right\nStanding Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nA isn't to win all the districts around it or the a newspaper down in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander some ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talked about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district or out in western Maryland\nThey used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the winds and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes\nBoth parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these lines may not be fair right but the the people who who cry fairness tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nDo get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the GOP is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricted by a nonpartisan commission slow deep tweeted\nPage redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislator branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\n... he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had with folks are that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel\nPractically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all look to government at at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know where is also a Detroit has pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts and so their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThat of fish all that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they what\nFor each and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing those town hall says a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn than eight years later some emails coming coming out a talking directly about how these lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests um\nWhat's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work I'm happy that Thanksgiving dinner and we ... yeah yeah my mom gathered five hundred signatures and is canvassing every day they got thirty days till the election so\nIt's been really exciting and when you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree on but I really like working on this issue because\nThe basic concepts of fairness\nAnd an impartial system and a system that puts the people first I think that there's some of our core democratic values that when you think about America you think about that and it resonates with people across the aisle and not always at the people who are right now in charge but the average voter we see support across the aisle", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "08"}
