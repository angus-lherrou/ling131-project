A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult so have you been giving us your suggestions\nFor what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth nothing the environmentalists are suggesting would cause harm\nFrom my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nCourtroom cultural go Chris wrote essays and environmental science and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and teaching about\nClimate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are just regular people who might not have the education that I have\nAbout climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly\nBecause I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather some people say global warming and just beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nThe technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action\nWe know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question\nTo describe it and you know\nThis is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through um through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nI anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the UN's climate change by which we discuss last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit because they're not going to be around a collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way\nAnd we sit with the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line on ... the the consequences of climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survives\nThrough massive massive shift we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and staying vigilant I Would\nJust go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that the fatal\nIsm is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here two years ago\nWe eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the could golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent run away climate change we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually is\nWhen I'm by a ... a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hydra floor carbon Sarah manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration huh in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set\nOf CFCs chlorofluorocarbons to fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush\nA Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions on environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nI didn't realize it HFCs these are some of the the refrigerant chemicals that kind of kind of safe and the heat out of a refrigerator and help it than

tomorrow's program about being Native Americans\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders say direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant\nNative American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a\nOr you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop\nWill share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on\nNoel tweeted I'm these clients to think of anxiety kinda like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess let's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and the poll I Wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like ah\nThere are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies we have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires\nHave shown we need to vote I think one of the kind of saving grace of the er at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with those policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change sorter role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of protections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations and we are able to do a very good job at projecting or the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's ... there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a\nCollapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why and people get confused\nWe we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and that the the climate of earth planet has been ... oscillation between glacial an inter glacial states\nAbrupt warming ... followed by slow cooling into glacial state so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun Sarah\nBackup logging other changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial stayed last me it's so cool it's amazing like oh what is confusing like like bring it down to earth from me\nOkay so in the last million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nOn it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um ... ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the way goals and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you just yeah just heartbeat this hurts heartbeat but we hold too warm\nCold too warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat is off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes a little full\nPattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that\nI was out there on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system\nLet you go shortly but for folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we were very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house office or your lecture at American University Center for environmental policy at a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you Josh and Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ...

recent years but which one do you think has made the biggest difference was that the Iranian cyberattack against the damn in New York two years ago here's what Preet Bharara the former U.S attorney based in Manhattan said back in twenty sixteen\nWe now live in a devastating attack on our financial system our infrastructure and our way of life can be launched from anywhere in the world like\nMaybe it was when China hacked the federal government's H R department the office of Personnel Management that attack compromise to private information of Twenty one million government workers and their spouses and close relatives\nRepublican congressman Michael McCall of Texas chairs the house homeland security committee here's what he told CBS News in twenty Fifteen\nThis was the most significant breaching federal networks in us history in my judgment this was an attack by China against the United states government it qualifies to espionage and that raises all sorts of issues that we need to do\nAnd of course there's Russia\nCyber attack before leaving office President Obama stressed the need for action\nAs a consequence [laughter] important for us to review all elements of

U. dot org John we're looking at all of the tax that we know about the one from the office of Personnel Management Facebook that big hack\nAt the credit reporting from Equifax we're talking about many many many millions of accounts should we just assume that we've been picked off at some point I mean sometimes\nI feel so personally foolish for having lived my life online without worry before it became a host of this program I just did not even vulnerable but just foolish like to not be more thoughtful about the fact that sooner or later my personal information is going to get picked off is that a reasonable feeling\n[noise] you know you hope that people don't feel foolish\nIt is true and and one of your ah your earlier guest commented on it which is we don't do enough to educate on it you know like my ah girls in school now and they don't have a standard course in the public school system on basic cyber cyber security and unfortunately in need it right now or it's not a safe space\nAbout it in the books even that are most sophisticated institution so let's say MIT\nLearning cyber security unlike how to code was not part of the basic curriculum so even at the highest levels people weren't thinking about this day to day I Hope that there's time for a change in that it doesn't depend on just your behavior ... or ... which is\nYou know when I grew up in New York in the eighties\nThe ah it used to be if you made eye contact with someone or you know if you didn't cross the street when you saw someone than it was your fault if you got that there's a famous Saturday Night live skit it's like what did you make eye contact and what do you expect to get out of that that's kind of today on the Internet right like if you don't change your\nAlpha new Merrick ah thirty character password every thirty days for twenty five different accounts you have that it's your fault as a consumer I don't think we're ever going to get out of it if that's our mindset well we need to do is focus ON Technology\nThat makes it easier for consumers to use and also recognize there's maybe some stuff we just shouldn't be doing using a protocol that's fundamentally not secure\nI Do think that we are having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even that meeting the county west had with President Trump in the oval office there was that shot\nOf him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those replaying the home game and he's a really bad password to we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the\nWar in what ways\nI think we're in for a generational struggle and that that struggle is going to include not just the use of force but this setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live in\nAnd then you need to execute on those values with your tactics so ... do deterrent bring criminal cases make public\nHit companies around the world like Maersk shipping FedEx\nHospitals and took them off line I think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world worked together to collectively impose that cost on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity to say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting end this war has already begun and part of what I was telling their stories that we didn't used to tell that we kept secret inside government but now we're trying to make public I think importantly so that consumers so that companies\nCan ... a ... that were already in this conflict and start taking steps to be a part of it\nYou quote your old boss early in the book here's part of what Bob Mueller said in a speech you worked on back in two thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller set at the time quote\nThere is an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end the same roads lead to Rome's downfall for they allow the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people and places\nBut the invaders those whose intent is not enlightenment but exploitation and extremism are marching right down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote\nIs this another Roman moment do we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\n... I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that were\nUh Pennsylvania area it was the first major speech on cyber as a national security threat I think about that it is now considered by the director of national intelligence all the major official to be the top threat and it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director of the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later I'm a number of former Justice Department person Monica bicker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years running mastery division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case\nUm that I talk about that still I think people haven't heard about a bit of a case that looks from the perspective of a company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks [noise] he also through bitcoin you also on the back and had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named ... who's saying he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to him was turn it into the kill list that said using this customer information\nAre located from his safe hole and Rocca a Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of the stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live that's the new era of national security that\nAn companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world that function before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John if Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a where hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world in different countries and they used a hack\nTo simultaneously allow them to withdraw money for me as from ATMs I think Michelle does have a point that you know for twenty five years\nWe moved to almost everything we value from analog space from books and papers to digital space\nAnd connect it using a protocol the Internet's protocol that was fundamentally never designed was security in mind huge advantages to that economic convenience however we did so systematically and this was true in government along with the private sector without taking into account\nRisk without taking into account that the bad guys the terrorists the the rogue nation states the crooks are going to move into that space we're just starting to reckon with that\nNow and it's vitally important we get it right because we're about to have another revolution towards the Internet if things now it won't be our books in papers right it'll be literally and this is uh something that actually happened it'll be the pacemakers in our hearts\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals

some of your stories tomorrow on one day we've been talking about the threat from cyber attacks and we know that some hackers are hell bent on stealing our secrets so\nNow might be a good time to go check your Facebook account the most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you law bright in without having type your password every time\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or trying to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's\nAn optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love for making their voices heard and for building communities in businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and that the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica ... she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions as new post every day or so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to ask you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove the terror propaganda that we've removed from face but more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us\nNow once content has been flat as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nAre and making a decision if it violates the policy than ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's got to be a hard job being a content reviewer\nAt Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the U.S\nWhich expertise we have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire content reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have\nNative language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used so that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a constant review or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one\nSo for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook that violates terms what's the difference between say reactors flagging and proactive flying how much of it\nIs the kind of thing that say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with [noise]\nWe still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on a site\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech harassment a lot of that is very contextual for instance um you know there could be\nAnd and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how's that pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves for instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance want it to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it the page that's representing al ... page that has been created for the purpose of ... somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nWorth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lie or copy and then there's other options I mean does other options there is an option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world does learning to use Facebook a ...\nYou've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time to have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience and finding these reporting options and even just understanding how the site works\nSo we actually do the options that we offer people to report content actually do vary by location and we're always testing ways to get\nMore report to us to make it easier now there's a tension here if you just have one big red button\nAnd people can press it whenever they want than two things happen one is that people might report things when what they really mean it's just to hide it and get the content away from them because they don't like that person and the other thing that happens is we don't have enough information about the post\nTo routed to the correct reviewer right away\nSo you'll notice when you report something on Facebook we ask a couple of questions not many but a couple of because we want 'em to find out a little bit more she does she go into one of our bullying experts and does this need to go to somebody who is a German speaker if we have too many questions we know people actually won't finish filling out the word so there's always that tension", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "16"}
