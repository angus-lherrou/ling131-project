A. M. U. dot org\nFactor that common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have\nPaid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two I mean it it it\nComes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nAnd one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization one\nEvaluation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worse factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same mind when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich has engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in the state attorney I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them the scratcher attained annuity trust\nThere's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on to family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Donald Trump in his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kind of things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I like to get to one more comment that were sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far as I hear is that he use certain mechanisms to avoid paying taxes as we all do\nWe all take adoptions standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with Suzanne what would you say to Jack\nUp at the top I mean these aren't standard\nIt's interesting 'cause it's true that the rich due to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about 'em is company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nFor a Trump in in the early Nineteen nineties was getting old he had a ton of buildings he had a lot of cash 'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Fred Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent of state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on and we're talking\nTens and tens of millions of dollars so what they did was for years Fred Trump he would go out and he would buy supplies for his buildings you know we're talking boilers pay every new boilers paint supplies for just does all those sort of things and then one day\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from American University's ... school of business\nCommitted to business being a force for meaningful

day\nBack now to our conversation with Suzanne Craig and ... of the New York times still times to get in a few more of your questions and comments won a X. W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality of the ah the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the ...\nScott additional tax in certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the invoices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trucks were doing there so it sort of a mix up they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations\nOn any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said her husband\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some talks\nOh because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be for potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not pay tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders\nUm and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cast them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make the payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full force of the law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money\nWith all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only ... taxes but penalties in interest on the money that sold so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities and other authorities could be looking at um where the\nFood they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing that all county they were filing false documents or with the state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd if those could be we've talked to several former prosecutor said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're proved that Donald Trump's success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none\nSudan and they're\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made billionaire um there was no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire but what we showed it\nThrough tax fraud people may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune in where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um say he didn't get revenue or money from other areas you know there's been stories that some of it has come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father\nUm over his lifetime and that he was willing to cross the line\nOf terror people coast to coast including to living presidents
