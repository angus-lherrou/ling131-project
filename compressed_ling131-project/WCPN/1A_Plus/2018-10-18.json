A. M. U. dot for the call I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization\nOf today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but it is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nKnow a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of\nIt not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by\nAll of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections and you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that\nI Wonder one of summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all ... Texas focused on the house for example how many feet with the Democrats need to flip the house\nSure said Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to\nFolks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say may show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or a midterm year and there's a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and midterm years\nIs there are certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch gold at the Democratic party's aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pick up some tendencies or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three of turning the the House bill in the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that is it a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want\nWho wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling water some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist pulling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public falling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I was gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nDespite all the talk of Kavanaugh you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general do medical I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with directions with not having enough\nHoles in down ballot races even even U.S House state house and stuff because\nThat I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian or write my own and then if I Need to know what the raiders coach or not if it's a if it's true it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need all I Need some polls to uh to divide and it it actually changes my vote the change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Dominican that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nQuite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen [noise] yeah I mean I don't\nPolling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact I'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a\nNot a good way to look at the polling uh I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions of giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way\nMore useful I should note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which we called can we trust polls\nOn our website just search for it on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one letter a dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learn more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation\nDot org\nNow to our conversation with one of summers of the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's the mythical months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a X.

P. R. dot org lifts\nMe and has for years the complete inability of the gyms to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summer as you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and\nHow well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think what lawyers pointing to is actually really common and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how to fix that and number of the conversations I had\nI have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record midterm turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking the people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump's\nBase that um I was talking to some groups that did some field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned off they said if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump's face on it they be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that this\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about healthcare message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we could follow up on the scene was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John lifted our inbox\nShould John where he is sure to New York so often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans for Democrats or Republicans would instead of doing that they should be\nOr such and such the Republicans to stand for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for X. I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\n... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where\nAre the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example or by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this mid term\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight or the listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advice to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are there\nHe has a has Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do a memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here fact checkers [laughter] there's plenty to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever their medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... of out el ... candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to send a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think of a lot of Native American candidates or you know just in New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire as a Democrat now\nBut when again and we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when we're not going to democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three have been democratic women\nJust if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running a hot that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nIt'd be I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman who'd been nominated\nOr Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll and you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between ... and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican\nYou know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat but I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans and I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative women\nFrom the local those local level seats all the way up so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list the group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when female candidates so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came and this back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around Dr ... Ford and justice Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and he's on them early and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know\nThat's something he doesn't like it's something he wants to see more up but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house in ...\nVery expensive at the very top it's very tactical if you don't have helping you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody\nRunning or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation before that long explanations you gave on the Senate floor\nThat made a lot of people rather upset with her final decision I haven't personally seen that'd be made into any kind of political hay for democratic candidates have have you\nWhen it comes to today's job market the harvest is plenty but truly the laborers are few why can't company's fine workers and how can you find work\nFrom W.

U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes and he meant to what then deal you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree\nNone and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find what you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job\nRight now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging there's prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs Joe yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in wise to crunch\nTo get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like his billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what his manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with us is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank Brian can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture as we've talked\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we're just having observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example of wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy and I'd also say that\nThat's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page\nAs someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can see wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nBut show emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands travel to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nOr [noise] well I I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in national traveling there that I Know and I lived there that airport over half a million or caters everyday into the city and out and many of those are coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I feel like you know my point of view is I'm going to set of a wider industry perspective in in the Senate\nI'm an Asian such as automotive construction and manufacturing there just to be shortages across every single sector whether it's factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we are not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations at my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n... how do you see this did the impact of\nOf older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nIt's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we've just decided we don't want you\nYeah I think that's that here in New Hampshire it's kind of like a to a degree that's less of a problem than it may be in Silicon valley for example because if you don't\nHire and retain older workers of chances are you're not going to get any workers because our our states as I said our median age is the second highest in the country so\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one an a\nFrom the three I O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics Sendai O T solutions learned more it see three\nI O T dot AI and from the William T grand foundation at W T grant foundation dot org\nNow to our conversation was ... and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regard\nManufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left the voice mail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics in our house and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we were really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent has definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us another one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be\nKnow makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in I Will withhold my thoughts on your ... your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but this listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska\nTen thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy miners the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nHe had to come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business miles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly a pot of completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work as really are coming home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair counting\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those was family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of lake here I'm going to St Clair river\nUm our largest how to port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down to match the Detroit to to be employed but they love the small town life or\nOutside Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier jobs I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um\nBut the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like pork here at Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was the last to be government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair accounting in St Clair accounting Michigan also still speaking to us T. Bo the president of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts\nAbout the labor shortage won a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy tell me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair county and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nChicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live this region maybe\nPaying the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region or you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected\nWe give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up and then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here\nAnd it's really a simple back scholarship would pay the loan holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up Sinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in\nFifteen thousand dollars towards one's Dan I'm guessing it's like where there'd be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand overtime\nThat's exactly uh Joshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually young they could be in their twenties or thirties or forties\nI'm the chance to go two or three years without making debt nationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received our average at an eighty thousand dollars\n[laughter] that that's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was\nCaught it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and yeah definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will ... will you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know ... wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nIf there is evidence that young people are moving to bigger cities in in large numbers you've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much anymore do do you think people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nYou know that's that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort of traction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move to a small town America\nI'm One of the biggest impact of this programming is dispelling that no I'm not saying ten thousand young people a year want to move to a small town America New Hampshire or this part of Michigan but we've already had far more applications for this program that we can possibly find", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "18"}
