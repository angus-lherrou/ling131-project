Europe Radio Free Europe\nWe all believe help would come America would come to our aid and I remember when we're all together around the radio and we heard that America was not going to help no one was coming to the eight of the Hungarian freedom fighters and the rest of the world didn't want to get involved\nThat was so unbelievably devastating and the look on my parents' taste is was unforgettable\nI remember November fourth all of us together in the basement of our house flooding on the basement floor listening to the ... of machine guns now and then as above us the ground rumbled\nAs the Soviet tanks fired their heavy guns and machine guns house runs and made their way up all clip that shoots a in a show of complete domination and suppression of the revolution\nIn the months that followed we lived under the terror of the new regime relentless pursuit to arrest interrogate him prison or execute the freedom fighters and those who assisted them in December Nineteen fifty six on a tip from a trusted friend my father learned that he would soon be arrested\nHe had already been detained question then released and knew he was being watched\nBoth facing possible execution for their part in the revolution my parents' painfully made plans to escape to Austria leaving everything behind and taking only\nContact regarding the arrangements for escape when Russian soldiers suddenly seemed to have moved in such numbers that my parents decided it was too dangerous to go through with their plans\nThen we learned that the train we had gotten off had broken through the guard station at the border taking all its passengers into Austria\nWhether they wanted to escape or not although we understood that this was a matter of life or death for my sister and me it was most heartbreaking to leave our dog ... and we cried for him the whole time we were actually glad when we could go back home to him\nBack again in Budapest my father's old friend who was now an apple a member of the secret police warned him that an order for his arrest was coming within days\nThey quickly made new plans this time to Yugoslavia like the first time again we left without saying goodbye to anyone not family or friends as it was too dangerous for them as well as for us it was better that no one knew\nOn January twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven we are at the border town of bio and according to the plans set out on foot around ten PM in snow knee deep from my sister and I carrying only are small suitcase\nAnd we set out walking toward the border we wondered for hours in the night away by the bike is of the deep snow in the fields unable to find the designated crossing of a small river\nWhen we came upon a small ... when my father peaked in windows he saw with horror Russian soldiers who miraculously were inattentive and unaware of our little family outside\nIt was cold and very hard and tiring to walk in the deep snow especially for my sister and me but we walked on and eventually came up on a farm house my father took a chance and rouse the family inside he desperately bag trying to convince the man of the house to lead us to the crowd\nSound to aid anyone else across the border\nThe two fathers talked as both families looked on\nUntil the man's wife told him he must help my father for the sake of the children he agreed to lead us part of the way to where we could find a crossing on our own when a man left us after describing the way to the crossing we walked on as instructed and cross the small river\nBut then we crossed the meandering river again and again something was wrong we could not tell now which side we were on hungry or Yugoslavia I learned recently that what I remembered as a river was probably the wide undulating water Laden trenches dug to mark the border\nWe were all very cold and tired when my father so look out towers and the distance after he determined they were on occupy he let us up the ladder of one hour for shelter and much needed rest then we heard a church bell in the distance and my father noted the direction of the sound\nMy mother had gone to school ends on board in Yugoslavia and remembered that the church bells were wrong at five in the morning instead of six as being hungry so we waited for an hour listening for the church bells again when the bells rang again my parents knew which direction we needed to take\nBy now Don Was nearing as we set out with renewed energy and hope and soon so houses in the distance\nDon Was breaking and ... the little town ahead of us in pastel shades of things and yellows that reflected off the snow\nIt was an inch chanting surreal sight\nLike something from a storybook magical that is high remember it and still picture that morning in my mind's eye a beautiful vision of are reaching feed him safely to gather if the four of us walked into town a man on a hay wagon called out to us in Hungarian you do that get\nSeen the terror on my parent's faces he quickly we\nIn the den communist Yugoslavia facing the threat twice of being sent back until eventually arrangements were successfully completed in August Nineteen fifty seven to immigrate to the United states\nAnd that is the part of the story of my family the part that I Know and can share all that my parents had added to it I Will never know\nLike so many of their generation they picked up their lives and went on living it is remarkable all that they lived through they endured World War two the brutal communist regime the revolution escaping and starting live all over again and again\nLike so many others who did the same they steal themselves against adversity they handled it as it came and they didn't feel the need to talk about it and I so regret that I didn't ask when I had the chance\nAnd so many stories so much of our history died with them\nAnd so the importance of us telling our stories becomes very we'll we have to tell each other and we have to educate others about what happened in Hungary in Nineteen fifty six and how it affected the lives of so many of us if we don't it will die with us\nContinue with today's special program commemorating the anniversary
