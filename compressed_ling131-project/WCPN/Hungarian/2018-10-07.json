winds\nJoining us today are Andrea ... and her husband Elmer ... board members and past presidents of the Cleveland Hungarian heritage society which is the sponsoring organization of the vintner

D at two one six four seven six nine nine three nine to one six four seven six nine nine three nine\nYeah maybe this is a good place to mention that this is not closed the plant\nThere's going to be at the Canterbury golf club it's a nice dinner Saturday October twenty at this is a fundraiser for the Cleveland Hungarian heritage society which runs the museum in the Galleria\nAnd their website is Cleveland Hungarian museum dot org and you'll find more information about them being a dinner there as well as the phone number to call\nA four reservations which is to one six forty seven six nine Ninety nine but one mentioned this again I just wanted to mention that sell in case you're already in treating your only at the first course [laughter] but and we go so why do we have ...\nFace for the salad course we have from up throw up the mountain region is about an hour and a half north of Budapest\nAnd it's next to the famous wind going region of gas and there there have been vineyards in this area since eleven century so this was one of the original wind making places of hungry and they're\n... he's the ... and his son produce the farm about twenty five acres for\nTheir state and from them we have the two thousand Seventeen ... Josh either shy Oliver and this one is a cross between a ...\nAnd they must cat or toenail wine so the crossing of this is what\nProduces this incredibly perfume and floral wine and this will be excellent for salad course and this one also has a kind of a mineral sailing quality but it also has a a great deal of food is to it than than wind people might describe this as a little bit\nAnd they would say that it almost jumps out of the glass so it gives you that burst of this you know as soon as you taste that one and this one\nIs a little bit heavier than the first one\nCall content here's a little bit less and that's what makes it a little bit lighter but the grape is a hundred percent the shy Oliver gripe and of course are from the Moscow region\nWhen you say Freudian as I think people need to understand we're not talking about sweets\nWhen you taste the wine and it pops out at you as you swallow it you can feel something fruiting ass but when I'm reset tart that's probably what you will let you be ... right but that's perfect with a salad\nWell I Love your discussions and you know this is radio so people can conjure up whatever it is certainly when they hear you it sounds delicious to me the descriptions are amazing and I understand that you kind of almost need to train yourself to be able to recognize\nSome of the slave or self someone can guide you to pay attention to the to the nuances of what you're tasting\nWhat up a good one a would be a perfectly balanced want is one that has four qualities and if an which really seeking in once as a balance\nAnd that balance or you know first comes from the city the other one and that gives you this that initial tart taste that tells you that it's a but it's a wine and if there's there isn't enough partners to it they would call it flabby you just don't have that you know\nAnd then secondly the fruit and we talked about food in this here before because one I mean cause for great ... so so you're looking for that the essence of fruit and and sometimes you know there's hints of apple or a pair of Africa and different other things that are in the soil\nAnd so you're looking for you're looking for some Freudian is in the wind and then the third thing would be what was called ten\nThe the might think of it as a grip you know in and and that gives the once structure and if you don't have enough tan and then they would describe it is flat ... and sometimes you can taste that then then the fourth thing is like alcohol and obviously it's wind that has to have some some alcohol content\nAnd if it has the right amount of alcohol content than it would be called full okay like a full bottle of wine or buy a cabernet and\nSo the higher the alcohol content the fuller body to whiny and\nYeah but it it could get a but but but sometimes you could have too much on and done that if you have too much done it would be termed as um as big or hot or too off on the other side of it so once again you know ... for the for the the city the the\nFood knows the tenants than the alcohol so\nIt's an art for the um individual a business to create that balance\nAnd within that they have such a range of the flavors and all of these these wonderful descriptions that you get ... and and all these other things\nSo so they're they're designing these winds by considering the location to do right now they are that they are limited by where they are geographically within those parameters they still can create these various nuances ... makes one wind better than the looks\nAnd then it also matters when you pick the great you know ... you know one way can picking a week later makes a difference and sometimes you could pick a too early which you know which is not good and the fact\nWe know of of of a young woman who owned those\nThat six acre a wind the state she would go to a ... when she was new and still getting started\nThe time he would say yes or no yeah for them but it was for her to decide what the right day was right on because you know look for that because\nWe're talking about how you taste it and how you smell it and we're listening you know using our ears to sense\nA what a wine is but I have to say on this one has a beautiful color to I mean I I like to look at the color of the wind the first one is almost see through this one's got a little more\nColor and of course the third white wine will be the\nThe one that you know it's getting close to you know a deep deep or white wine color I like to look at color that's a\nGood point because I'm eating the drinking with our eyes most of our offices and that does make a difference yeah and just to remind you or if you're just joining us we're talking with our gas Andrea an animated ...\nWe're talking about the Hungarian museums fundraising event there twenty second annual dinner which will be held at the Canterbury golf club on Saturday October twenty yet so far we've covered the delicious food and wine pairing is for the first and second courses we learned a lot about winds\nAnd they're amazing description and when we come back after this short break we'll continue\nSupport for the under an hour is provided by William Penn association\nFunded by on gearing Americans in Eighteen eighty six loose for a little benefit society offers life insurance annuities scholarships and for a turtle eggs to reach for his members ... called Jeffrey ward it for four zero each three eight one two zero zero\nAnd so far we've talked about the first two courses of the Vietnam dinner this is a five course meal um we've covered the appetizer and salad and the winds that go with them so that go on from there on our number three one and this will be for salmon\nAnd that this is the two thousand six teams so much a piano agree this is the shoot 'em up\nAnd read those ... among so tamed hungrier around Thirteen Seventy five they came to the both on region and so it's still called through the ... you know what I mean good great for and this one has a little\nGray fryer relied on the ... yes exactly\nAnd this one is described as luscious aromatic and refreshing\nAnd it is a little more alcohol and this so this will be a full bodied white wine so with that point little ...\nStronger and this is great for the salmon pairing you know that we have a fish because salmon is a relatively stronger a sin oily fish\nIt needs a stronger one to to to a match up with it and so this will be just excellent with the same ... shuts a silky texture and cutting acidity so this'll be just right\nUm but I understand you have two entrees in two different wines that could be best paired with each one of those\nSo people can choose between salmon and pork and even before we get into the port wine\nOr we encourage everyone to taste both the red white and the white wine with their main meal regardless of which dish they're eating because that way they can taste the one that's not paired with their meal to write you know and and today there isn't such a clear delineation saying that or if you're eating\nYou know white you know fish you need to drink white wine chicken is white and only beef you know that line has been um lightning quite a bit and so you mentioned\nNeeds he taught can ... get disasters and hot Nate he taught ...\nOr ... left ... is set up ducked I've I don't mean ... who saw the con Canterbury Gulf Coast\nThen ... keep to watch it at ... God Knows any value ... as\nAs state and they get these Fletcher data that you thought calmly camel gosh new we taught them ... again ... ... ... ...\nAnd ... on my dad was on than thought that shows up program ...\n... ... ... ... ... still on the Oprah show back who's at the ... and as we said before you don't have to be Hungarian you don't have to speak Hungarian everyone is welcome\nTo the wonderful opportunity to perhaps if you are Hungarian share some of your culture with friends neighbors\nThe rest of your family and again they don't have to speak and Gary and the food is wonderful wine is wonderful to Hungarian music that the camaraderie and the friendship that people will extend do\nIn the tradition of the famous Hungarian hospitality\nAugust loosely ... your leg and again my daughter was ... ... ... again ... ... ... again and again I Want to mention that we're also going to be talking about some of the other features of this evening and there was more in store than justice remarkable dinner\nBut where do you leave off are we to the desert we are the ones\nThat will be the two thousand twelve relocate bolo ... elite harvest ... the ... state was founded on just about Twenty years ago in two Ninety eight and twenty five acres and it's some of the best historical vineyards in the region\nThe moisture here comes from the Indian Summers and it creates the perfect environment for ... ... is this a shriveled sweetness of that\nWe'll grapes are are very very sweet and they're matched into a ... paste and they're typically put into the U.S who winds now a late harvests does a little different because they don't pick the grapes of different times late harvest they pick both grapes the healthier grapes which have not shriveled\nAnd they also pick the over ripened a shovel grapes and they blend these into one wine and so this would give you your your best introduction into the sweet wines of ...\nIt's not that concentrated sweetness you would habits gas now like you know I like like like an ice line would be\nYeah it has some of the shriveled sweetness some of the sweet grapes that that the\nWhen the grape or you know it has um is is out there for maybe just a bit too long\nA the sugars really start to form and so it just said it becomes very concentrated and that's what they make this the you know the paste out of but somebody else who comes in various gradations of sweetness\nSo they they blend the both the the um the healthy a newer grapes as well as the over\nRipe and ... you know into one blend a this is the great ... so this is a hundred percent would have been great it's a six years old so two thousand twelve vintage\nAnd uh uh the sugar content though is a hundred three grams per leader so this is what distinguishes and\nUh that's that's quite a lot of sugar I'm so for example the the uh the one our number two one with the salad this year the shy Oliver has three grams per liter and remind one hundred and three\nAnd yet now they face peck yeah but it's but it's not an offshoot sweets\nNot yeah ... yeah like gold but it's what it is a sweet wine it's a dessert wine but it's not a heavy wild I simply sweet ... yes yes do told us if it's very sweet\nThan the fabulous desert that we're having which is the ... cake from translate ... bakery with chest not cream okay and and chocolate on the top\nWould get last they would be competing with each other so the wine once again complements a sweet cake desert or towards dessert and so I think all of us really liked this one\nAnd I was just thinking that the it comes full circle because our first why the light dry white wine is a form in grades\nAnd our last wine is laid harvest for me\nAnd you know it's a world of difference same grape same region maybe not the same vineyards handled very vibrant handle Larry differently that very fact that very differently\nWell I just want to ask you about that desert you mentioned that a a a youthful sight to see it have felt like triangle it's in the shape of a triangle it's one of the signature desserts for transfer of any a bakery it was one of the first ones that they came up with and [noise]\nAnd um ... lawyers measure she does a fine job with it and the committee decided we were going to be a little difference this year and I think that the wind is going to Paris very nicely apples that sounds delicious yeah [laughter]\nSo this particular one was a ... show that comes from some of the ... the vineyards historical vineyards uh ... and those would include the tone of mob or on the father\nMy father or they're yeah it out you know it's a beautiful part of the of the country in that northern eastern part of my dad or side where you know it's ...\nYeah I guess so this this one is a desert one book some might also use it as a Perry won with so but it also says screw up a diverse range\nSo the possibilities are that John ... honey sweet right\nYeah right right yeah [noise] so ... so we're very pleased with the ... group brings your ones I think a year or so before you like to swap a\nLot I Love listening to it thank you for your hard work and for the comedian ... of course behind every great man of great what would I Do all the wind out\nFurther beyond that ... members of are surprised woman\n[laughter] but anyway if in the evening well you know not just center on food and and good company but\nWe'll have music will have a piano music\nAt the reception and harmonious will be playing during the dinner and harmonious is known to our listeners are they're just a gym in Cleveland right really can mix at any kind of news and they'll go we're going to ask them to go table to table like in my ... and bring a bought us\nA little bit of sentimentality of what that was like when the musicians would go to a table and play a song for the people sitting at the table and then moved to the other table and and this is what I mentioned before that if you've been to hungry and you have a memory of that or if you're going to be going and you would like to experience what that's like\nI think I just read someplace that Hungary is trying to re introduce into their restaurants that that concept and they're actually helping musicians\nGet jobs and and ah restaurants hire the type of the the gypsy musician who used to go up and play the favorite song you know that's that a man romantically would ask to have played for the young lady his way so charming as long ago as twenty ...\nYour head and are not interested in that they just move on\nBut if you want to listen to a whole ... does they say\nUm it just adds to the evening and ... von because if you did it have any of the Hungarian music that you're familiar with or you can just humble few large [laughter] and they'll pick it up so it just adds to the charm of the ... yeah\nLike if I ever experienced this this is just a great place to do that and yes and so and it's also great cause and you also have a silent auction with some\nFun items and you also have an honorary yes we do this year's honorary or\nIs the Hungarian cultural center of northeast Ohio and the Hungarian cultural center of northeast Ohio\nSupports a beautiful park out and hire him Ohio where they have picnics once a month that during the summer with various teams and it's a great place for Hungarians of all generations to come together\nTheir president is Mary Jane ... who also happens to be on our board and is also a member of the committee\nBut we thought that an honoring this organization and their president were also I'm giving 'em recognition for a lot of hard work", "show_name": "Hungarian", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "07"}
