immediate ... ... more from the leader Sacha ... yoga\nMy calling this study was to understand how flies are able to maintain power while flying and then one thing we already knew about flies was that they have these specialized tied links called how peers and I'll tears are basically to fry equivalent of your inner ear of the stimulus them so they use them for balance\nAnd flies can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the healthcare should not fly and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control culture the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was Seventeen fourteen I think but what we didn't know what how the whole chairs actually work though what information where the whole chairs providing to the fly through an artist I hear that out what I did was to record from the whole cheering her on and I\nIt was when I recorded while the health care was in a position that simulated a fly rotating so basically my data showed that five can tell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of the spikes coming from their whole cheering her on\nThe boat what they're targeting as well because the ability to go over at the same time the girl sue court quick than of getting away\nYeah so the ... century organs are more reflective so they're a mechanical sensation that sort of how you feel I'm as opposed to vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behavior just because it's much faster than fish until it's kind of like they can immediately detect a rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about funding\nSo it's important for us because this research has shown away that complex aspect of an animal's environment can be broken down to the timing of a single spike\nSo this is how our brains initially represent information in the world through single spikes and single neuron every thought and experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons and Pfizer no different just seemed to be here to study fly because they have a lot fewer neuron than a human one\nWhat would be for for humans information\nWider than human neurons work exactly the same way\nSo it certainly helps us to understand how different organisms sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology wise it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanisms for flying so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same technique to build our own bio inspired technologies\nI've gone to yoga
