curbing carbon emissions and avoiding a climate catastrophe but first Thursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunction\nMade an emergency dissent back to earth and they're\nHappy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and others so like Detroit subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there\nYeah so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistic descent which is so called because usually they add make kind of added a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agency said immediately they would begin investigating around us so far that that's all we know\nWell the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of things that astronauts train for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not\nWhat's their Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station is ... you know a little bit of a problem is no other way to get up there right\nSo there are um I Believe three so use missions\nPlanned at that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again is undertaking this investigation\nAnd so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I assessed\nA minute there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we have three people on the space station right now but they're scheduled to come back in December now they could extend their stay a bit but the Soviets capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home\nI Believe it's only I can only stay up there through some time in January so\nUh that's the longest there'll be able to say before coming back down and that means that the space station probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it but I don't believe it's ever happened before\n... ... will love love to check on whether there are experiments up there but yeah you know with an older whatever\n\n[noise] this is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nThere is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex\nAnd there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security the federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems how does all of this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid ...\nYou can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I ... I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do their\n[noise] I'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nA tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration data bases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against 'em or election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers eat pull books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certain\nPutting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the software wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that\nCase there was something different you know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company be our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nI'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nUm electronic pull books or what you kind of what our used they're often or a tablets or or or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said a last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that there were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised [noise] well\nI'm I'm well that's actually quite a controversy or questioned him ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nYou know perhaps to influence the the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines that systems um in the first um the things that we would make is between the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one\nStates um they got attacked there was a voter registration systems um and then there was a voting machines themselves\nThat are used to scan scan paper ballots and\nIf we're thinking about the voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerability that are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually and effective attack on them\nUm and you would need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to\n... hour day right um well I mean I tend to kind of um\nIf I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I\nSteps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election\nBeing there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing that\nUm there were mistakes made but\nA skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking\nThat the machines right now for twenty Eighteen\nAre well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subjected to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I if I could just jump in real quick point um I I I\nI I think that to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course is connected to the Internet um and an example of that might an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on\nIn other countries ... election reporting attacks um and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social media where I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in a Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and Thirteen states\nA paperback up that you can go back to afterwards and say yeah maybe there's been out cast on these elections but we can go back and we have something that's independent of the software to tell us the results [noise]\nUm I I think that's that's very dangerous and I am hopeful that in the Thirteen states where we still have these um paperless systems or that will be replacing them before the twenty twenty election\nThat Sunday evening at six o'clock here ... only three WCBS and\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature to quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts\nSuch as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement ask\nCountries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C. this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to to\nBreeze matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much great to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh you were each are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday I'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd good for example\nSo for example on what they found is they look to cost a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer um when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects I'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent I which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the back to ... degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on\nThere have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get\nParis Agreement by twenty thirty instead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to make one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the report won't go there with that can can you answer at least who commissioned to what they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was a in a company in decision and that decision on requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being\nUm reviewed publicly reviewed I I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says\nI'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together detail technical analysis interestingly in this case\nAnd that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that on negotiators calm make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] [noise] oh we have a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nYes hello so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts\nUs in agriculture is the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to yield are in the Central Valley of ... of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the are the highs not just the average temperatures and and I\nCould fix this by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientists were talking about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ... death\nOf the things like that that will instill make us grow\nMore plants and we didn't have 'em for food feed and feel I have a you are you a farmer [noise] no\nI'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy cheaper which makes food for food feeding fuel all in the same maker and it uses little water and nitrogen you know everybody thinks we're going to have some\nPuts the two of the atmosphere what all the plants will take it up if we switched\nReverse some of the\nThings I see some really good points here I think first on as um as you mentioned the one point five degree goal is for global average temperature increase temperatures increase at any one location especially on any one particular moment in time\nAs well as its impacts are going to vary and that that's an incredibly important point on interesting leader the report does talk extensively about carbon removal\n\nHumans beat stress with exercise in prescriptions squirrel monkey [noise] have a very strange way of their own I'm Ira Flatow and this is science friday [noise]\nBecause our primatologist Anita stone translate the culture of squirrel monkeys we'll talk about what monkey chatter\nMight teach us about the evolution

California\nLater in the hour a primatologist takes us into the world the south America's squirrel monkeys and what they teach us about our own evolution but first the Maya invented a sophisticated mathematics system that included the number zero zero how to be invented\nThey use this in their calendars and astronomical studies they also had farming systems in a complex political structure to govern the sprawling city networks\nIt was a complicated place and the full story is getting even more complex last month scientists surveyed a Mayan mega city in Guatemala\nThat I had over sixty thousand structures and this week researchers say that the Maya may have also had a salt industry on the coast of president they believed\nThese results were published in the proceedings of the national academies of science here to tell us about the Mayan solve the economy is Heather mckell up she's an author on that study and professor of anthropology and Louisiana\nSo what technique do the Mayans were were they were they using to make salt [noise]\nWell I liked people around the world of course everybody needs dietary salt in ancient civilizations and other farming cultures as as well but uh the ... collected salt from salt flats off the north coast of the Yucatan but in in other areas like the coast\nOf Elise where it rains a lot and you you they don't have the solar of operation possibilities they were boiling blind in pots over fires and they\nWe found at in southern beliefs are below the sea floor we found wouldn't buildings which indicated they were doing this a salt production indoors on a massive scale\nWhat what was this surprising expected [noise]\nUh yes it was I was really doing a regional survey looking towards sites are after having worked elsewhere on the coast and I was looking in shallow areas\nBecause in the water because I knew about the ... civil rights and we found site said or about a meter below the sea floor and we excavated them and they had pottery that identified as salt making pottery\nHave been published a book on on the fine salt white gold of the ancient Maya but in two thousand\nWe made a major discovery and that was that below the sea floor its main growth Pete and the Pete\nWhich is resulting from sea level rise a\nIt preserved within posts and now we've mapped over four thousand we actually met four thousand to forty two wouldn't post and other architectural elements\nAt a hundred and ten sites where there are wouldn't buildings that are associated with the salt making a material and the significance I guess is that a

where she became an instant celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even the mob dead at press conferences one of the first two American animal successfully launched into and return from space Mr Baker's flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth analyzing their communications the structures of their societies\nAnd the brainy ways that they navigate their world as my next guest says Anita stone assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks welcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood\nAs one of the first animals that went into space wow what got you fascinated with study scores\nSo I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazon and Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise]\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [laughter] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow so how many do you study how many there group a number of your study\nThe way you do they each have reached personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them some\nSquirm one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving\nOut of their sleeping tree and uh they spent a lot of time active ah all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\nFor their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle at once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom and out with a head up and then they bite off the\nAnd the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a ... right why don't why haven't they do that\nYeah so I've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low and once the adult waft desert the nest\nThe adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] those watch for not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n[noise] our\nScore a monkey actually spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls I'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not\nNot a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I can recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there is\nAnd a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there's an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies have jungles or you know that that ... that we hear is that right there there's usually this is those a squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because hormones you sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of\nBird how hard was it how much time as it taking you to know the difference in the study that sounds to me\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or [noise] but um my field assistant who's a local field assistant\nHe's the monkey whisper and he knows everything about squirrel monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing it for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well the call\nBy the human language for evolution of our language from from starting them don't squirrel monkey yeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social groups that we're increasingly large\nAnd so ... Manuel grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes andme attacks\nBecame less less feasible really and so the ideas that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact and social bonds with their their friends\nUm and that would leave the hands also free for other tasks um and the idea that that eventually would have evolved into human language\nNow square monkeys for living in groups so groups so large but they're actually pretty a social they don't grooms we expect primates all to do that but they don't actually groom each other\nThey to live in social groups that are large um they don't groom and they talk all the time they're constantly chattering there it's nonstop sound when they're forging when they're traveling\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon and go on the most important journey of their lives after living ... years in the wild\nWild oceans they must win back to the coast to one very particular river mouth and then reach ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they find that finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just the ... but that's just telling you wearing north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north isn't more northeast\nDebt Pacific salmon can detect the magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about their Olympic dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said about but sandman living impressive lions right they travel all the way how many miles to their journeys tech\nThey it's it's pretty impressive and their journeys\nCan be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds ...\nAnd and they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this they they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThe ... same and have a diverse array of tools that they use\nIn order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and then the term we think they're using magnetic maps and they make information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals\nThat were transferred from a landlocked lake in\nTo a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery\nOr in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you frown but they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they knocked on my in laws and that is correct and and how were they able to retain these in one\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for maps and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different\nComponents one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as magnetic field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth\nAnd so they're steeper toward the pools and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict are favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo it's super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel flee former type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nThey're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but it's one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species have tiny chains of magma tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic properties and so these chains of mango tight are\nAnd so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials so these structures are thought to be\nFound in the nose and also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm no worry warranted important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\n\nWell it's a rather interesting question so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that\nCould go to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity and\nWe also wanted to know or if it lent examine\nAlso possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse amount of no amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect a magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were ... and subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coils and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct\nOf that electricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to alter the direction and off\nMhm so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know one grade schools of if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting their magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf that were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of NATO type right that\nSomehow connect with an herself right and and so how did the fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement ... by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scaled ...\n... so what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nWe have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments with ...\nAre together and to the house finer core scale responses actually are\nMhm so uh could could you save endangered salmon then by knowing some more about them\nI mean always helps to know more information about uh the the that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decision would certainly be helpful and probably a tool\nAnd than and conservation but certainly not the only thing that now I live with them yeah well good luck to you and your future experiments All right thank you very much\nMichelle Scanlon is or faculty research assistant department of fisheries and wildlife at
