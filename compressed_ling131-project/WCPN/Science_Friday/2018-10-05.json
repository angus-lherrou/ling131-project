I'm a chemistry part prize was split with two other researchers right Stuart Smith and Gregory Winter ... and what to what you do when for [noise]\nSo they both work on a this technique called phage display which harnesses bacteria phages they're viruses that infect bacteria\nAnd it's kind of a ... similar principle where you're taking advantage of these living systems to produce useful molecules proteins and anti bodies um that have all kinds of biological and medical applications and what about physics [noise]\nSo in physics the prize was awarded to three researchers who work with lasers a pretty cool [laughter] I'm Arthur Ashe skin dried Morocco and John Strickland 'em and they basically not just use lasers but use lasers as tools so African um develop this technique called optical tweezers where he basically\nFigured out that when you point a laser focused beam of light atmosphere ... object to the object is actually drawn towards the center of the ...\nYeah [laughter] it's a real life tractor beams and fortunately it doesn't work on that largest accumulate they're pretty focus but um it's fun to think about\n... and ... after winning the dumbest trickle unexplained what amazed her most about the research\nQuite late generation is one of these remarkable things one color like water any clear anything at all the college football for sure and and it's just remarkable to sit there where it all this color\nShades of Isaac Newton yeah and it was cool hearing that Strickland actually mentioned that she um uses white Gen ... ... light generation when she teaches introductory physics courses so that's something that anyone can appreciate you don't need to be a Nobel laureate to see this really\nCool phenomenon heartless move onto physiology or medicine\nSo the award for medicine went to two researchers James Allison ... for their work on immunotherapy um this is basically a treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight against cancer\nAnd both researchers discovered proteins that after this break on the immune system\nI'm Ira Flatow and you're listening to science friday we're talking with Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twenty the Nobel Prize in chemistry um hey you know a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were a very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the differences\nWell I Love to build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] years it's really amazing\nSequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you're saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function\nRemember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules in codes the the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules so what\nYou mean than what what do people mean in ... when you say are the directed evolution\nOf something what does that process me\nIt's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n... my son you talked to said I have fun for spring molecules to have sex\nOh yes I Do [laughter] well if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a strange process and have all these half\nThe population that doesn't carry the next generation so there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dating coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to Adrian and Hamdan I imagine [noise]\nHi this is a gun and Hamdan um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it's the towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on the subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science says it\nDid you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to I\nWas lucky my father was the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls to do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with and I like being the winner\nThe compete with well you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\n... ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age was talented in science\nI think all children are talented ... and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urged to bury things\n[laughter] I Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty and dogs are so many interesting behaviors\nThat can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details of that are as we sequence more things and under ... and measure their properties will be using important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to pull out what is that genetic basis\nWhile you weren't you in terms of pay that my my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I give you while he's got some money now from the Nobel Prize or what kind of tools would you if that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have a powerful enough tools to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use AI machine learning\nYou're Ted Talk you said they want to be a great ambitions is to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards be [laughter] you know we broadcast the eggs every year the day after Thanksgiving and we know Marc\nAbrahams pretty good so I think we can put a a you know might be able to put in a good word for you know\nTo well I was actually hoping to win the Ig Nobel prize before but that would be fun to me that would be marvelous I think it might be a little easier for\nYou know I think a doctor for taking time to be with us today\nThank you Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the ... Nobel Prize in chemistry and she's a professor of chemical engineering bioengineering and chemistry at Cal Tech [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious issues individually political races can we have better conversations about the issues they get is most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene Chang a mathematician a scientist and residents at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and um [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners of funding in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey ... neighbor\n[noise] hey hey they're either go ahead I fell off by\nPreviously identified myself as a and its firing feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic with that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to um\nThe mail in the same way um women or being a man who contributes suicides ... systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine system and so\nI'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing I mean that's\nI'm In identifying myself in such a way it really changed my mind um and I thought about that\nThat's great thanks for calling us that it's great that very heartening\nHe's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we others see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spend two don't trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view\nAnd we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's religious he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences so in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly\nUsing emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analysis experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions don't require man he requires empathy empathy is carrying enough to respect another view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way pauses math and these things have poor as boundaries I mean we've construct because a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes but I\nI find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician are not\nLet's talk about some some of the current events or which turned out to the artist topic in current events and that is voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault against a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process is at play tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about roamed definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials and it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle\nBut it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for saying sudden things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to ... ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nUndone accused bus and let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused Boston is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil syfy has studied the paradox is for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels or finding\nUsed person to be innocent and then we can look whoa whoa that create for us and what mathematics does a little time as it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen and does happen I'm happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault all the time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next problem is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot where people get into arguments in extremes and so many of our arguments at the moment ton devices\nAround saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but said on his blog that that we are ... just spin the both will crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is an ... an argument's where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone is a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault\nWhich again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\n'em to finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a little while you have to decide what you'll default position is and then to say you say in the absence of other evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very show that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court\nAppointments than what we're doing is we're giving them something very good and important and\nSo we should be very sure that they deserve that very good an important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation to be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial the we should nuke we should not\nThe showing us about the fact that they are bad and those are two they sound the same but that's slightly different situations that have a different ... situation [noise]\nHe'd for for seven to four to five five lots of people are checking in on that let's go to a career in Washington state Hi welcome to science friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough an op ed piece in the wall Street

about ... the dung beetles why not they they interact a lot of nature the small worm like parasites like to hitch a ride on their insect partners as they fly from one young Patti to another sounds like a pretty sweet deal to them and then the name into it right\nBut perhaps not so much for the dung beetle CD nematodes actually ride on the Beatles gentle where they can be passed on to their offspring or mates\nLike an STD now dung beetles put up with a lot of them done but what do they stand to gain from this relationship\nMy next guest says as Vicki and it sounds there might be a very good reason for a living those parasites climb aboard that decrease in that to Christina la done reading gives assistant ... research scientist in the department of biology at Indiana University in Bloomington welcome to science friday Ira\nSo tell me about these ride sharing arrangements between the dung beetle and then you might do that in these two organisms interact\nHardly um well when a done deal is ready to reproduce they a tunnel underneath a done Patty and they create these developmental chambers out and done that we call it breed ball and in each of those ... balls they place a single egg and from\nFor shelter and protection and uh none of toads right along on these beetles they're they're small worms\nAnd um they end up in these developmental chambers along with the developing beetles and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um\nThat this association existed and so this is something that we wanted to investigate more to understand the consequences of that interaction\nFor comic tell me what did you learn\nWell um we looked at all in all different parts of the um ... and we found them on various parts but we were particularly interested in is really high concentration of nematodes it's found on the genitalia um it's a good place for ... to hide but also it's a really\nCompelling a venue for getting to the next generation because it's involved and reproduction\nAnd so what we found was not only are are these ... passed between males and females but they're also passed off to the offspring and the offspring that develop alongside these nematodes actually a grow faster and larger than their counterparts um that don't have these ...\nAnd so there's actually a fitness benefit to having this um [noise]\nI wouldn't even call it a parasite because under any conditions that we tested we didn't find that that the number two it was actually bad for the developing beetle I'm In the the conditions under which we tested those we always found that it was a good thing to have it along so it's more of a mutual is really\nSee I was wondering about but usually a parasite or something to talk to weigh the life of with your tone strike but this was not what's happening here\nNo and that was um nematodes are are almost infamous for being parasites they're parasites of humans of cattle of plants I'm In a lot of our attention is directed towards that sort of negative interaction um but less investigated his ways in which they can't\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow and the past few years the field of exoplanet discovery has really taken off\nThe journal science advances brought the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet but eBay moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dash twenty five ... be and his some four thousand light years away has to do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex ... cheese and and it said graduate research fellow in the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday\nThank you very much for having me first what what moon is is we're ready to give us a little thumbnail description sure yeah so it's\nA a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there are a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange\nUm orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to the size of the plant so\nThe size of the planet is ah by the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is uh like I say about the size and the mass of net\nBut even at a pretty unusual moon that big well it's certainly unexpected right where if you look at the moon's\nSolar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat as sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see so large\nThat and this case uh yeah it's like you know there's there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact our scenario like how we got earth moon ah ... coalescing out of a disk ... material swirling around the planet and the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons ... Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally ... capture scenario like Neptune largest moon ... as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... [noise]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large man how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it's certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah yeah we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but ... detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yes ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the trends that method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness ... the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moving around that planet than we would expect the big dip from the planet and then a smaller ... the moon blocks out some of the light as well\nIn addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of horses pulling on the moon but the moon was pulling on the planet and so that makes the planet ... around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so sometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late\nAnd so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this the death ... transit of the moon but also uh something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're\nAttributing to them and ... and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in\nWell so it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes next door now claiming is ah one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job or trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal a good question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system and that's that's pulling on this planet and making and walk around\nA those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible is not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nReally it was so unusual I'm reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you write very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about this\nMeasure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet in the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits it with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nOr so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event ah we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth\nSo you'd have to stitch together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they gave us the time there\nUm it can be used up uh the Webb telescope ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point it's going to be\nHeld X Y yeah if it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as humble orbits the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked up\nHow a James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the mirror is going to be really spectacular so uh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly all the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know there are dams officer there isn't\nA man obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built a highway or something else I think some law well we should have made it twice as big what you're saying whatever\nAnd I'm sure yeah you know so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to ... that we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... ... yeah that's a that's\nA I I don't know who's working on a ... it's a ultraviolet and read and optical that's L. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh they they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instruments stadium Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is and I tell you this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about art\nAlways come with the question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd ah you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here happened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here and that of course speaks directly to\nUh the question about the origin of life for example uh so it's particularly since this moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this it's opening up the new questions about the dynamic will histories of these uh a planetary systems and and the speaks directly to that\nQuestion and the more exoplanets you discover the way thousands of them yeah there about four thousand confirmed plants I think at this point in the more questions you're going to open rather get answers fast\nWell you know that that's a good enough number and does that ... we are now really filling in some nice statistics but there have been surprises along the way we found these things called hot Jupiter is you know plants about the size of Jupiter but very very close to their star nobody\nReally expected to see these things at all and even twenty some years after their first discovery or the theaters are still debating how you how you make these things\nI saw a story today just in passing I don't have any details about a new exoplanets too big you shouldn't be as big as they write it sure it in a\nIdea Stream\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nTo pull you didn't squad one came a single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn that the the clock back\nTo that time period Deborah or you have an entire chapter on ketchup\n[laughter] what was so and then to that prime while you're devoted a well I read it I Know\nThis is a catch it as just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind of a but in the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of thin nasty\nA sauce with a lot of vegetable ways in it people would put pumpkin ... people would put tomatoes but they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called Tara dies and then because of the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preserve it as in like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch if we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent to his ah some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives I Want you to do some\nAnd that was pretty fascinating but\nLet's talk about a ... Harvey Washington where only a little bit more the focus of your book in the partisan squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that the what the more you want to know why did you have to do it was amazing [noise] it's just crazy\nYou I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really sense for about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know\nAt completely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison ... squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at salary silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine and he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men did\nProblems and because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you are food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poisonous ... gets to the bottom of the food safety\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller ... his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also like to enter a preacher\nOn the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war and he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling\nAnd and ... really I mean what was interesting about him was that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party spilling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on\nTravel golf [laughter] they can take a drink of water that are [laughter] there you go um [noise]\nHe has this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general\nPart of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right but he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually dead that's the thing that one of the things I Love about\nThis story it's a story of a single person who drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety so did he actually more and more of their laws created because\nOf his crusade to Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can mean\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that kind of title wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection law ever pass by the federal government\nAnd so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you ask why ally he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished but and\nA lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died before it was created\nOr you know you were said though that you disagree with some of his of his tactics [noise]\nYou know he was as I say kind of a holy roller yeah and he became very rigid I I think some of that was that he was under attack constant attack both in government and out of it for Thirty years and he kind of ... to some extent and their perpetual defensive position\nBut also he he just\nHe couldn't bend on even the little details so he would like spend his political capital this is my personal opinion\nI'm sure it appreciate it [laughter] as a second guessing ... years later [laughter] you would like obsessed about you've made of vinegar and it's a fake vinegar and you should not be allowed to even put\nThe image of a great belief on your label but can somehow that might make someone think that you were really great and so he would spend a lot of capital on these very tiny details", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city":
