Intergovernmental Panel on climate change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by two degrees Celsius might look like\nThen on the heels of that report Exxon Mobil announced that it was throwing financial support behind the U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled here with the story as well as other short subjects in science is on there are finding a staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on a service that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nProposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker this is a group called the climate leadership council\nAnd it proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise overtime than they would use that money to go back to people like you and me essentially in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimated that would start at about two thousand dollars a year for a family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon wants a roll back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related lawsuit that want damaging\nBut um other industries have also tried to get\nA Exxon has a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been a head of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped to author the PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels ... years ago in in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers\nSaying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another you know ... make us look good sort of thing\nThat's always the question isn't it I mean the thing to remember what Exxon is that they are and investor owned company so they do have to answer to their shareholders and they've been getting a lot of pressure in shareholder meetings to better address climate change also climate change poses a business risk for them um in terms of their facilities and\nIf they aren't out ahead on this they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor and another way a carbon tax might actually benefit them is that it would target the dirtier fuels first things like coal which would clear some space for one of axons other products natural gas\nAnd of course the catches the things they want to exchange for getting other environmental regulations rolled back\nAndy immunity from lawsuits I mean those are all things that benefit the company so you know this could be viewed as an act of self interest overall\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one ad of three per se is by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind this uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies and what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rates globally\nAlso what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision\nFive five you can tweet us ... let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's and author author on that to laugh at Syracuse also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over U C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do\nPart of it has to do with um insurance and um access and a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the country's than overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women and\nIn Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm of this part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access\nAnd a wealth education\nUm interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because I'm ... says area and is not a low risk\nUm surgery it is it's a major surgery ends and things are\nThere are small bit serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to stay in at the ... there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not\nThe sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr go thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen has been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... in the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nThe tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions or a patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise and sit there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that\nWho's responsible um it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that my country\nSubjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on other emergencies that might be happening on the brink delivery unit that might put some pressure on them to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do see a\n... a highly what's your reaction to that\nI Would completely agree with her the the culture the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental I'm there in a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a badge and birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieve a national burst\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Hi Lauren welcome to science friday [noise]\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nThough I actually had an emergency C section thirty why don't we [noise] um and I would do for ... for that for that [noise] um but when I got pregnant for at that time I really wasn't given the option of that bird after that 'cause then\nI kind of had to do all that um is it I\nSaid I I I look at what they had to look at a rate what were the very end mighty future pregnancy and um it really was up to me it was\nLike my provider that you want to have the time I was like oh sure I like that but I was that get their wrists\nI was able to\nActually win that Senate rain heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and I could I really don't like that and I was able to how to do that but I feel like there was a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had to\nHook up in a lot of information very emotional and it was really hard to find the facts\nAre ... let me get let me get a really great great call him and get a ... a reaction Tony ... you know truth be told on issues should [laughter] I Know I'm One of three you back to ... everybody had to have won the section after another and learn was sort of thing you know I didn't know that maybe I did manage to\nHave that access to the back or a veteran of birth actresses area and is going to be is one of the critical interventions that we all as a health care community are going to have to embrace and need to embrace in terms of lowering the overall ... delivery rate\n\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increase in the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nI guess or doctor Holly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing director Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous ... Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach deer compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWe live in it differs in several ways and actually when the land is slanted series on C. section came out that Debbie World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says ... and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is wet the u._k. does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the good wife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed in the Lancet also published a series on midway free ... and ...\nDecreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by mid west so that's not a causation it is an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado and you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very\nStop telling us when babies are on well and nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use fetal heartbeat monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science in objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definitions for progress in labor a old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and um and do the out of them for ... back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and its ... year we're always from so blown down here in Boston and so there's this old me mad at the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ...\nShirts companies ... and versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report\nHolly will ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level the playing field in in any in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one and in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\n\nYour your shoe of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for national delivery than a scenario and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay let's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications through a chronic disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm among laypeople and patience and um I think\nMy chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that as questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know pushed the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nI've got about a minute to Tony are only would I Would\nI Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... and are fully fully discuss Tony what about this the charge of structures of their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how baby is born\nI'm the person who gives birth to the baby becomes a parent's uh after that happens I'm it's no lesser no more regardless of what the motive delivery ... delivery on certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a vegetable

friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the\n[noise] think about bees\nAnd answering spiders tiny as they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem where there is food or pollinators are predators\nAnd they have another thing in common complex social behavior think about the term hive mind ride\nThis idea that to all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world but how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful and can individual behavior still pills to hand fate for the whole group\nOr the hives indeed legion my next guest looked at these questions Alice Waters is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumble bee and Noah picture woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\n... what did you know if you ask everybody you built tell you the honeybees get all the attention right and it but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nThat actually did my PHD in a honeybee labs and but I went Robie and worked on bumblebees instead I started to make a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and ... and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to honey bees bumblebees have a very different like psycho right after the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social on there's never a point in their lived in a life as a hobby queen where she's living on her own the bumblebees are different and they have an annual\nAnd these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot and start their own nest so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens\nAnd workers and this sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought a new show us with ...\nI did yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bomb will be used to actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these be groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\nAbout ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals\nAnd economy contribute to forging paid roughly ... at home you're Brooklyn ... which are ... Jarvis harvest giants from I'm here in California for extra partially on the sidewalk\n... slightly larger than what we are a little bit longer there but yeah and they're like ... and the ones you see on the sidewalk and what why are you interested in the\nA him the blacks are the true ... and and then\nTwo ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another um and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they call their friends to the food so another thing I brought here as a cast ... to flip it over I was on its head\nAlso would hang out with like that that's a cast of a an ... yes use their like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly faster flyers from Home Depot\nHow far does that go down as just the whole length and\nNow that's the top part\nAbout six eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is that type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and it will break the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these days a lot of ... that determines how they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee wonder about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said the ... the drones don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this and we are those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is\nEarly larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your influenced or write or were there on the rights or just go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets styles\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack that up first or do you work with food and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybees okay but not by movies [noise] um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the\nTerrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were somebody being me to\nUm does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B\nInteract interesting ... requests yeah great question but no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how worried are large different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground whereas bees will and put their hives and say to fame three cavities and\nWell relocate from one site to another so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and kind of the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will also there's a species of ... that will look for\nCertain privacy is that again have small entrances and our dark places or there's some similarities in some differences I think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have am colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands in even up to ... million so at least cutter\n... million individuals\nAnd just been talking for Halloween I Know that you also started his social spiders border social spider\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are living groups and the reason we think they leave in living these groups is so that they can capture pray that is larger than them and so they offered lead build these\nKind of retreat structures where they live and they raise their offspring together so that you see behind me is they are a bunch of fading spider moms there actually each one is probably the size of the centimeter centimeter half so half an inch or so\nI'm just taken with a macro lens and the small individuals or their babies that hatched from their ... um and so they take care of all these babies together with their standing on is basically a little nest that they built and then they build another Web that's what we call the capture Web and so that can go basically on on a whole a case of tree\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arch plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nDid you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard but I Am not the only one I can see from the audience that district's about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great\nTo consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... thing\nBut it is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work my next guest has the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is yes for\nOn the majority of long term studies that are looked have found that if you get significantly less or significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night then that doesn't work out well for you in time in a lot of trouble yeah\nBecause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that's them\nAll in all honesty I'm In the six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what\nWe do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately bad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up to ... after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just made me up with the kids not get enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work\nDid you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis not getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke\nAnd diabetes and I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what is one of the genes\nDo that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about\nHow genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nI'm there a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you refer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day or sleep most of the night or what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep\nThey're expressing the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study it'd be on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have ... so the mall one is what's known as the clock seeing\nYour clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know the clock is er [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly\nHow to recover from sleep loss and he wouldn't even have to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes to low that turned the heat on your thermostat sort of the heat on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day\nIf you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having you sleep more if you get too much sleep it will go into the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved\nThe research of many that have come before me is that the genes that are as like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from you know so when you say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle\nSun comes up in the morning goes down at night\nUm synchronize o'clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate other period or frequency close to twenty four hours question over here yeah I had a question about napping\nAs I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of in the cells\nSo napping is a is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself than an hour and I do agree one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon no one can complain you can write at all I Know what I Want to research [laughter]\nBut you're saying nothing is important is the laughing is very important if you're not getting daily sufficiently and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommend it but I think from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much and that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is\nOne of the three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh so I can be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either directly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me let me go to the questions on this uh yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the\nDay because yes [laughter] and and as a parent\nI definitely want that to happen because getting my kids up in the morning before noon is a challenge how does your study a fact our decision making and farming our society in that arena\nSo the quickest way to answer your question is that my study doesn't affect that at all\nBut there is a good reason for that and the reason for that is because the science behind\nAdolescence sleeping and timing the fact that adolescence on such a adolescent restoration is associated with a delaying circadian rhythm is well known since I first came into this profession what would you bring up as a great point about", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "19"}
