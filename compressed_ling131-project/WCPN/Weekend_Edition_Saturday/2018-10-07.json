hours or do you was from George Brett\n\nThat the president at a rally last night in Kansas will hear more about that elsewhere in the show but let's begin this hour with multiple she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent he Molly Hi\nUh so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrat to sort of weaponized the me too movement for political gain\nAnd on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters uh with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now ... sitting Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country like a week ago\nWhen a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart and that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow the an analogy\nI you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions aren't how emotional they are for so many people\nParticularly ... particularly women\nAnd I on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the\nPresident yet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] this close to an election\nIt's it's hard to tell what signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nA ... and the trajectory is still\nRemarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to regain the upper hand and ah and do well in this election\nYeah that's the thing though right because um this is a great week for the president um but his poll numbers are still low because it seems that even at this moment um there are scandals we have a huge experts say by the New York times laying bear facts pointing to and agree just tax

after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor Ford sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bells\nBut while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing cabin\nAs a legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation a moral obligation to do better than this\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford and other brave women who came forward and you want to vindicate their sacrifice\nVote Republicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post\nThe whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh\nFor energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle there's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nWe're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu\nAnd body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives\nI like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do with the Constitution's says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked\nAbout the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important than for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of a terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now\nRights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin other places just as Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement in June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like I'm closely contested\nCases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment\nFor the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the

and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because this story was all I knew and it was so important\nTo all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told at the time that they adopted me by the judge shifts\nThe judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were\nYou were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts are so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me just say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents' experience as white Americans\nI really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I

the Saudi constantly has ratcheted up regional tensions\nThe Saudis have strongly denied the allegation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul now to sort through this story I'm good morning Hi Lulu\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know Jamal ... walked into the Saudi constantly Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to offending marriage too\nOut a Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record by an advisor to president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate\nA aired on says he's saddened at the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far we haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that show is dead just the persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\nYeah what if the Saudis can saying\nWell the Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that the show he did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon or the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very keen to know what happened to him a there is no evidence on the outside of wherever to show that the show he actually did leave the consulate\nUh the consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of the show he said the consulate has multiple exits but why would show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting up front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president air to one says he's convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in this stumble on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show the either inside or leaving the council\nAlright two questions in the first one is um why is this important what does this mean for Saudi relations with turkey and with other world powers well\nIt could be very important but a lot will depend on what we learn from here on about ... disappearance what happened to him that seems likely to be further blow to Saudi turkey ties are relations were already strained Turkey's been siding with another Persian Gulf states Qatar and a bitter dispute with the Saudis\nAre

to Topeka\nNPR's camera keys traveled with the president and joins us now good morning Tam good morning\nAt this rally was on the schedule before the final cabinet vote in fact the president watched it from air force one you were there time what was the reaction on the plane\nYeah he wanted the reporters who were on the plane to watch him watching the final tally come in and he gave a thumbs up\nAfter that he took some questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that\nI think that's sort of [noise]\nI feel we're really wished wrong\nHe said at a rally last week a\nIn Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory and Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that turn that rally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points across the Republican spectrum tickets to the rally um this is your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans was that a parent in the crowd with these rallies notably happier and more satisfied than Trump's crowds\nPre Kevin I'm well they definitely seemed to be in a good mood but here's something that I found really fascinating when President Trump talked about Kavanaugh they cheered when President Trump talked about how terrible the Democrats are\nThey went wild here is just an example of one of the many things that President Trump said\nYou don't hand Rogers during our senators and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's
