Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected to submit to conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we could both name conservative justices Souter Stevens black men Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations good\nYes we assume the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named to Bush now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been a growing force in the court for years and the swelling presence on the federal bench that it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don

decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscored there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population um\nIt Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination\nOf decades of organizing um are Republicans\nEnergized to get up to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment ended up feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut midterms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party\nAnd that could also be a big factor in the midterms I'm now it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in the surveys you mentioned unemployment is at a three point

that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we will ... Georgia's Megan thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian balls before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it than to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate this\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople they're basically two days of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian Bussey Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... ...\nI've necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my cupboards the whole time there really is there were two talking points in the U.S [laughter] neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats\nAnd so forth [noise] um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ... making the hurdles thanks so much thank you [noise] from\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course he's executive editor Bloomberg opinion Tim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nEasily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story\nOf tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald represent over the years I've built what I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize that maybe people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly\nA large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company it was essentially a shell company called all county that\nThe Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pockets of differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own\nRather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nTim O'Brien of Bloomberg opinion thanks so much think he's got\nThis week a report by Bloomberg said the Chinese government operatives planted microchips

indicated also I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator mantra news just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabin on people\nIf he's up for reelection and thirty days and heats his under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah we'll but when you use a politician to being a politician is though that's not much of a surprise visit there I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah corners and I did do that to him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell her tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday that didn't really go well on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had\nProbably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told\nStories of sexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he their way he he was very engaging the conversation he had to step out of the room but did it back for like ... you\nYou feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely gauge he has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that it's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if the judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers that\nAre high does continue so uh as far as the Senate goes we it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had a because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done\nA terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis and so he kinda runny nose and believe an opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and uh he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nYeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue yeah so we're working on were working at a state wide to change things you've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if it sounds as if you have accepted senator mansions votes for what it is still support among a great many issues and I got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has it has I think the I think ... ... a worst choice mansion does still support us on the AC a and tax reform so sadly we still have to go with him and hopefully get somebody else at twenty twenty four\nTaylor Wilson of West

consecutive teams celebrate on your home field and yet you sound great\nOh thank you fail isn't all her show one of the great rivalries in sports a Yankees Red Sox the Sox won last night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh thing\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\nUh Houston Astros put the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or a club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that the okay the red Sox won a hundred and eight games the Yankees won a hundred games but the Astros still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like champions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seemed to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves and\nThis is interesting because nobody\nOr he's had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night and you'll forget that but go ahead now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy ear and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out while the Dodgers have the national league champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you you have a problem with that I kinda like with the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the ropes merit to another and maybe you go to Colorado When things change but\nI I really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games just pension or in hockey Tom Wilson other

suspension in the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy\nWhen he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and the one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys that come in at a pretty high rate of speed and when you look at at the suspension now they're they're not playing around in their concluding this guy does not belong on the ice\nFor Brian thanks so much thank you he's part ... machine oh cop [noise] what\nGenetic sevens\nGraders Peter ... robo cop and
