are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations do have gas there very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it is getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which is like there\nIt's a

them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bay county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information from the waterfront communities\nOr you

most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has that effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and whatnot but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people make\nThat was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing it wasn't something I'd never been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh\nWho has their own story to do no I did not fortunately\nNothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church

years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been\nSuddenly over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new\nA new part of my life and since the breaking of some of

on my mother's incredible model and like most Americans you just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we answer to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten\nShe started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police white people would be\nEven a harsher and those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world in our state was joined us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the beatings that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this\nPersonal and structural I thing led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em any individual you started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police are not get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleeping in a row from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about that it's harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim and one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family\nWhen we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the\nHardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honest we talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death\nAnd I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true\nBut I Know I'm a writer and Norman American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this book\nHere say lemon has book heavy than
