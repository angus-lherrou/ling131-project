trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us good to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did\nThe violence keep them away you know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside or in the north there was shelling include used we know that they burn down one polling center outside bit of ... city\nHe's a candidate and he tried to prevent other people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what\nWill just mean they are guaranteed sixty eight seats in\nThe parliament for each province of but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back\nAnd it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there was a new generation of Afghans trying to change things\nAnd just briefly what is it signify that the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country in conflict to conflict at the United states is involved and\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether this vote should be held at all\nBut Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going forward this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision\nMore than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress as a battles insurgents around the country the Taliban or resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came out to exercise their civil\nRight that is Jennifer gloss in ... thank you so much agreed to talk to either the thousands of Central American migrants are at

constantly and assemble that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested that came to mind is that any opposition in the region\nPlumbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists to sit in\n'em and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now a there is a real great chill I think in the air among those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist up without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have you know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are\nBut they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important important important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined ugly\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... she's a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange they need him less than they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to go to the IMF it's very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to close sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was ... money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you on September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City

Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't done this has published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends species official Stuart eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official they're showing you sound like it's not it's a lie\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not just where not these about why the ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just is\nEven more I had reports all the shirt report that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean see I was before that that\nSo the federal police and the army were

students are on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is that it was just too\nI'm not so nice to versus what exactly that two bosses that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses was that two votes is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two

the Senate needs to have a a very intense discussion about this because uh basically President Trump is giving a sense that this was a credible story this half ... half baked story\nOr the instead of sending a powerful message about American support for human rights and and free press I mean this uh it just seems like almost like our ministry Asian tripping his regime as working hand in hand with the Saudi Government to take a very serious situation and tried to dismiss it\nWhat should the response the rich and powerful message the\nWell the message to start by saying this story is completely unacceptable it's full of every kind of Hall's not giving any sort of of credibility and that we have to get to the bottom of everything that that happened second is we need to realize that this is this is one piece of a broader set of issues we have to address\nA prior to the incident in the consulate the Saudis were using an intense a team of the folks on Twitter to discredit crush hoagie and and other dissidents or around the world\nAnd furthermore they are involved in this uh a horrific war in Yemen where we are actually assisting them and this is a situation where you have the worst cholera epidemic ever recorded in in the world you have millions of people at risk of starvation\nAnd here we are still ... providing fuel for their their their planes that intelligence for their

legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that are really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are very ... and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad potholes\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nI think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just haven't spent the money to fix the roads so let's look at Connecticut\nBoth what's his story in Connecticut they are talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that soon as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave traced a lot of ah Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives\nTen years read Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much that you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard

sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can over your identity and we can bring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why people have different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who
