response so far to the deaths in your mouth who showed gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership bathroom thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to Saudi explanation of how Mr ... showed you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ...\nWhen he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to to the to the Saudis to suspend\nHigh time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to a point of a value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nCase I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over ... trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we named\nTop two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you\nThank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember Haitian mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation and such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces\nAnd other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them or the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired too\nOpen your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty fifty\nThese special forces and and see all veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us\nIndividuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on lots of a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War short right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're enjoying a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or us ally that really is against the law that\nUm is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries will try it [noise]\nUm are there other Americans as the new ones and our other Americans you'll leave you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it\nAnd I've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work well\nThere are several reasons what is a there's a lot of money involved but they also argue is they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the ... the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we sell them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir arguments they're doing what the you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they they suggest

Simon we've learned over the past few years of the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of a smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for ... but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and ... the high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and links and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato needle wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you\nWhat can you tell us about your sister\nSister was beautiful and bright she\nThe voice and I'm later\nOn when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nA ... real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nKnow it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lift and certain not include that would not have been an accurate\nWho continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame are huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nUnderstand there's going to be a service for medical center there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life ...\nThe kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about his obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't now and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and not spend a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now\nAnd I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday but\nBonnie rich on man [noise] I Can't make you left me\nA indeed fun I don't know\nKato Neal wrote about her sister Maddy mentioned there in the Vermont we'd

Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of jump off the show J uh the president calls it credible lodge in Congress\nArt in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned its intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while\nHe was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about cabinet the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is oldest states' rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally

John ... thanks very much for being with us thank yous got [noise]\nWhile President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress has called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on its face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\n... reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWherever they long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ...\nIs right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly analyst Dan ... of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been ...\nIn a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or have to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nDrawn exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom as pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... and lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tank here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel Bronson author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Brunson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly than ever the\nTrump Administration has put all of their ... and they have been very very public about that\nHas sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter\nAs the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now there's been a great uh\nThis is where this is so\nSad but ... says Saudi Arabia was all ready backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich amount to show he represented for many of us was disbelief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he couldn't be patient he he expected to the patient about what he didn't expect with the reversal that he was seeing with mine it and some on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work

through the roof read the sun's out of LA Dodgers last dog so\nThey do and I'm fine thanks blue man group ... crew spy on nickname for um how do you like I like that I kind of do they keep coming back all season don't they\nWell they do and this is nice revenge for last year ... I mean there last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two\nAnd of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know that this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season\nIn Boston in Boston that's right and if they are they wait exactly yes and a crusty taller debuted as assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also still playing in the NBA for domestic Mickey Hammon of course has already in assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think it's overdue when I make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the and the NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA's been the one that has been better on on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris Burke on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not\nThat big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point\nBut in that we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter] no and in in that sport it's a big deal and in professional sports and the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the\nDoes well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's going to be good\nWomen's tennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's going to be a rule change it Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final what do you think of the rule change to go to the uh what what what are they going to do it the ... yeah\nAfter after twelve after twelve twelve then they're going to go to a tie break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the fifth set type breaking I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they think it's a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can sort of a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense then the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe [laughter] uh Howard thank you you're in San Francisco or their commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal\nPodium a thanks very much for being with us Howard was terrific thank you\nWhen the baby of and HIV

after\nThe transplant surgery happen now and to see this child alive and thriving under these circumstances with this world famous case is\nObviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made will help\nUs understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't\n[noise] yet so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three during the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for a living during a\nFull three times the average and this child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents children\n[noise] so the parents was saying to us why ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day why wouldn't\nYou consider us so they were sick need that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the ... that she could be a Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote sending Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from this\nPeople know about it we'll contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hope so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nSays I from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized and one of the things we would really hope to show to what we've done here is that\nIf you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you're living in normal life\nThen that shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stuff peace and having those options that HIV negative people would have\nAnd we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious Denton HIV stigma that\nCarried Etheridge medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you
