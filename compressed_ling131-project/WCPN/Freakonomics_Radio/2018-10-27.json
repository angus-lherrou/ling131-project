{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "So are we in a trade war yet well defined a trade war and they'll give you that is\nFor the past several months the United states has been trying to gain some leverage with its trading partners the president slapping new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from America's closest neighbors and allies sometimes gets bit rough Canadians\nPolite or reasonable but we also will not be pushed\nAround a few weeks ago a new trade deals struck with our polite Canadian friends and with Mexico\nWe have successfully completed negotiations\nOn a brand new deal\nTo terminate and replace\nAnd the NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nCalls us embassy a sort of just working families\nBut the aggressive trade renegotiations have continued especially with America's biggest frenemy\nWe can't continue to allow China to rape our country and that's what they're doing it's the greatest them in the history of the world\nChina is imposing new tariffs on us that today after President Trump put tariffs on two hundred million dollars worth of Chinese imports\nHere's what the Chinese trade negotiator said\nIt's hard to negotiate with someone when he puts a knife on your neck [noise]\nI'm no expert but\nKind of sounds like a trade war\nRegardless of whether or not we already know full blown trade what I think not a full blown trade war I think the first shots or had been fired clearly\nThe modern global economy requires a delicate balance which countries collaborate on trade while simultaneously competing against one another\nThis man my name is revert to ...\nI Am the director general of the uh World Trade organization\nUh since to any sort of teen and would you describe the director general role of the WTO as essentially a diplomatic wrote the diplomatic role of the uh a director general is the one that he has to perform as a\nAs a build the roads bridges he has to approximate positions\nYou have one hundred and sixty four members now a to guide and um and they have very different perspectives of a [noise] a everything on everything on on politics economics today on\nFreakonomics radio conversation with the WTO's referred to as a beta about what makes for a successful negotiation\nI Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know your learning kindergarten\nWe talk about whether the global economy is doing as well as the current numbers indicate\nIt's amazing that I still hear people say oh but the economy's great [noise]\nUm [noise] course it's great it hasn't been affected here [noise]\nEnd which came first the president for the terrorists President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he he didn't just fall from the skies\n[noise] [noise]\n\nIs freakonomics radio show that explores banking died of everything [noise] here's your house even got married [noise]\nThe world Trade Organization was founded only in Nineteen Ninety five but has its roots in Britain woods conference in Nineteen forty four which also gave rise to the world\nOh the post war global economy\nBut the political timing wasn't right for global trade organization instead of an agreement between twenty three countries called the general agreement on tariffs and trade was signed in Nineteen forty seven when the number of signatory countries reached a hundred and twenty three the agreement was formalized and given more teeth\nWith the establishment of the WTO its mission is to quote\nEnsure that trade flows smoothly predictably and freely as possible but in recent months global trade has become quite a bit less moods and much less predictable with the U.S threatening or enacting massive tariffs against a variety of countries and industries\nWith retaliatory tariffs quickly following\nThat's where we begin the conversation with regard to as a beta we spoke a few weeks ago I was in New York and as a beta was at WTO headquarters in Geneva [noise]\nSo we are in a particularly noisy a trade environment at the moment in the headlines all the time\nConsidering the threatened an actual terrorists emanating from the U.S a and considering the U.S role in the global economy what share of your time currently\nI'm is taken with issues that concern directly or indirectly the U. S.\nAre you talking about the largest economy in the world\nSo it's natural that a lot of my time uh we'll have some kind of relationship with a actions taken by the United states also because an action taken by the United states has repercussions are everywhere\nAre across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect\nSo of course a lot of my time\nHas to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President\nWas a a knock ripe and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is the result of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and uh if you don't understand the forces that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnosis and I have to tell you there's a lot of sympathy for some things that are said uh owned a part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO as opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that terrorists are are really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version then their their government subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nThe you the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time industries like protection\nThey want to be supported by the government wants to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call\nBehind the border protection a and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient enforcement of\nCertain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because terrorists you can measure the Arabs you\nYou don't know when they come you don't know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a committees are hearing the W. job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nThan not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding then or what other countries apply and that could be for the protection of the consumer\nOr it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure\nBut they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations they just stopped trade altogether\nSo that's ah whatever and infinite terrified at the border\nOnly measured and [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between the organization founding in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd two thousand Thirteen [noise] there are however many caffeine Harris rules are less stringent for developing countries for instance furthermore trade deals negotiated in good faith by one country's administration can be deemed by a leader administration to be unfair or just an palatable\nNAFTA the U.S Canada Mexico free trade treaty was signed a year before the WTO came into existence President Trump was not a fan of NAFTA\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSo he decided to tear it apart and put it back together again the new terms which address the auto dairy and other industries are more to his like\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\nTo be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage\nSensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to see a conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of ... but uh they're very very Frank and uh we explore all kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance\nOf the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talked to a ... tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be you know do in the line when others are and\nComing up after the break with\nThe head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask him to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nThough but don't worry Roberto ... has plenty more to say and we'll hear it after the break\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target presenting future

Organization was appointed to the post into thousands Thirteen when the trade waters were considerably less choppy than they are today [noise]\nSo you are from Brazil and you study the electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering and being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO\nBrazilian um well the good thing about being\nA Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse prospective Brazil has a is a big economy\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important or aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a\nLobster in its own rights can you give\nMe a quick example of an engineering like solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand\nThe basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a conservative parts and or figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but um I I found out that you're forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nAt least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed\nCountries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative relationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy will lose many gain a many are better off with the with the trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they are not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and are you cannot ignore that\nI think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing the transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies\nIt's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are ... are they have a role of course but the minor in this structural change\nHelp it okay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\nThere is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so\nThere will be a need to rethink the whole educational system in countries how to support the displaced people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how old are you will help them\nFind another economic activity that will work for them and to help them support their family\nAnd the state of course I and I I understand that people don't want this I myself have very strong reservations against a a big state by state at least his to think about this and think about the mechanisms that will allow us to to handle these are displaced a message of workers\n[noise] this is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my Pop's economics was through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economists which one was definitely Carl Marx\nMary Annette ... I'm a professor and the economics of innovation on public value at University College London you also advised\nAs far as I can tell a number of governments and governmental institutions\nSo I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland and also the special adviser for Carlos ... is there research commissioner in the European Union and I used to be\nSays share a special advisor to the secretary general of the CD is that right yeah so the city is currently rethinking its economic narrative and\nSo they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that a\nGotcha and also um ... advisory panel in Finland is that true\nYeah I didn't realize one of the whole and yes [laughter]\nThere's actually even like thirty more\nHow can it be that one university economist has the ear of so many governments and institutions for a clue let's get back to why months of Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about Martin says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic\nAspect of capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that ... was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is a fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution and consumption work and marks really talks about that\nSo it's quite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic of always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change\nBut it's not just technological change interest ... she has a relatively radical stance on the value that's created by technological change what do I mean by a radical stance\nConsider the titles of her books the first was called the entrepreneurial state [noise] those two words entrepreneurial and state typically are not used to gather\nMust have got his latest book is called the value of everything making and taking in the global economy when it comes to the relationship\nMy God the government what a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're\nDoing but she sees it differently you know what would ... be without a GPS publicly financed what would Google be without the Internet publicly financed de\n... was born in Rome but grew up in Princeton New Jersey where her father took a job as a research physicist at the University She studied history and international relations at Tufts and got her PHD in economics\nAt the new school for social research in New York and now she lives with her family in London in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nYou said well they're expensive got someone [noise] I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds\nI made an error they made an error you well I didn't write this is how they treat you know they trick you they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they didn't show me the price you know to the gentleman or if it's what that does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive wine that\nAnyone who read that article at the Columbia Sylvie ... social [laughter] right so\nTo someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad the somebody says that you say what\nFirst is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know we need less state I'm uh in order to be more energy\nDid that come from the free market or from an active visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the stage with involved in almost everything a and Silicon Valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but the role that public actors played was really across the whole innovation\nChain so you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream Blake applied research\nLike a DARPA but also its sister organization in more recent times called art they eat the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nOn search in high risk a research\nThere's some evidence of the government funding that Mexico is talking about DARPA the defense advanced research Projects Agency created during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nDoes over the years produced several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer mouse miniature GPS receivers each de displays and the digital personal assistant ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy found that under George W Bush\nHas funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tech\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying the extraction techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health has helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the FDA [noise]\nPublic institutions have absolutely co created value it's quite six\nYou start having to change the copy Larry\nOn that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating an enabling business it's really about you know taking on the lead investor rule with an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and causes that government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back how we talk about things I often remind people um you know the Plato or said that story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell\nAbout who creates value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home\nThe U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion\nDollars and part of that agenda was really also to direct that the school stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama\nFinance some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nYour new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder and make solar energy panels\nWhat is the taxpayers have to be the one footing the bill to try to shift some power or solar power works\nPeople said my God the government what a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know\nWhat they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of you know construct some roads education and infrastructure\nThan the lead finance or of areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of a\nA U.S government financing early on but more concretely at the same time that it was financing cylinder and also financed Tesla for a very similar amount of money so they passed last car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loan\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer so when cylinder Owen bus the taxpayers we're\nPretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance Tesla would it not have changed the narrative and the perception of what these bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists\nWhich you know takes on risk and so to speak to any a venture capitalist they will tell you that for every success there's many failures however if you really want to be a venture capitalist you have to construct your portfolio in such a way that you also get some of the upside from the wins precisely to cover that downside", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "year":
