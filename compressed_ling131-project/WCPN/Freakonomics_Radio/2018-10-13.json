supposed to die out\nThe proliferation of the automobile and everyone would move to the suburbs and never come back the decline of urban manufacturing\nAnd the city itself would decline and then there's all the crime and noise pollution and chaos cities are known for who on earth would ever want to live in any city as it turns out just about everyone we're in the middle of an historic and holy ... predicted rise\nIn ... happening here in America in all over the world one problem\nMany of our cities are old means they're not exactly optimized for the twenty first century and it's not so easy to retrofit an entire city so building a new city for the twenty first century end beyond from scratch\nOur mission is to use technology to really redefined urban life and the twenty first century\nToday on freakonomics radio look at the city of the future with a man who's been rebuilding New York city for the past few decades to men [noise] some people call a modern day Robert Moses the controversial mastered builder\nDecades past [noise] like I think if somebody says it in meaning that\nThey got a lot done um then I think it's a compliment I think if somebody says oh you did a lot of top down planning and you displace lots of people than it would be an insult it would also I think not be true\n[noise] along the way he learned central paradox successful cities [noise]\nThe question is how do you actually manage supply and demand\nThat's what he did I Am sitting on leaning back and smoking a cigar\n\nIs freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even\n\nIf you happen to live in New York City is I Do there's a name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and often controversial project shirt 'em Dan doctor off but don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name\nBut his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states\nYou grow up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but\nHe settled in in his wife started raising their family here he worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up this went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics and the eventual you that that idea became a bit of a movement it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg what the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh\nI don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there which says you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump ...\nCompany that made him rich but voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal smart self made fiercely pragmatic\nAnd he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about he was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack\nLess than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred an eighth mayor\nBloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other news sites to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDamn doctor off did that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nAnd Bloomberg was finally done being mayor into thousands Thirteen after squeezing out a third term despite a pre existing two term limit he considered running for president he considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and ... you know it's a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't want to go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nIs really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nA you've got delayed the one that would be to assassinate had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursue do you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they used the deadlines at the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city\nJob of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out the the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of regional will benefit from it all depends\nOn the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive region owning done in time et cetera et cetera [noise]\nNow the second question you asked was or we better off having now one\nAnd there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff done for\n... subway today if we can well right now\nI think that might have had a real impact\nRight we could have argued look all these people are coming I think it could have been a deadline to getting for example congestion pricing done but at the end of the day you know much of what we wanted to do as part of the Olympic plan and that was really developing the waterfront\nYou know in Brooklyn or queens or the whole west side of Manhattan or the high line or regeneration in Coney Island in Harlem and flushing\nAreas that had been largely ignored for a long period of time got a big boost from the fact that we bid for the Olympics\nI Love you to give me Dan in just a minute or two what you would consider the best accomplishments of the Bloomberg administration\nIn my area I think we fundamentally redefined the economy and land use of New York for literally than much of the next century and I I think the rebuilding of the world Trade Center site and lower Manhattan\nThat's ideas dream dot org slash lp thanks [noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDoctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then\nWho then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today\nOne of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr Offit is chairman of president [noise]\nShed I was just curious about the the why ...\nWhy did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back\nTo when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to uh build what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided that the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution\nWe set to standards for what it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York and\nSecondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world and so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem\nThat led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer something yes\nExactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Ninety\nHere's the Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather to shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the\nThe juice and leverage of the big city like New York\nThat's a great way of saying you know another way of expressing as cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends began to change I think that is a very different notion of a cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me that you and your folks around you who were obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that\nThat has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who owned land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee I\nWill confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition\nStop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave the using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system\nAnd basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nView was that financial incentives uh to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been to bribe companies to stay or abroad companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped instead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world\nYou know it was sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy um that\nSort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know you know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change our cities personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\nRoom\nIn cities unlike people reading companies can be as we noted earlier difficult\nTo retrofit in not just physically all those buildings that transportation and energy infrastructure but also psychic clean culturally and economically which is why doctors\nConcluded would be really interesting to start the city from scratch and two dozen Fifteen he teamed up with Google to create a company called sidewalk labs\nAnd our mission is to really help to redefine urban life or in the twenty first century combining cutting edge innovation with great urban planning\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\n[noise]\nI'm sure you've been hearing the ever more anguished calls to regulate huge tech firms known collectively as gas Google Amazon Facebook and apple\nThese companies is super large for monopolistic\nThey have developed capacity to manipulate us to control us to control the information that is delivered to us control the pricing which products are delivered to us to control us\nI'm In the tech companies in the past Google for instance has Ninety percent of global search engine market share\nFacebook has more than ... billion monthly active users Amazon has an estimated Ninety five million prime members in the U. S. that something like Seventy five percent of all American households it's estimated almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon\nThis kind of scale creates a lot of concern we've examined this concern in previous episodes like who runs the Internet and use the Internet being ruined\nWe're seeing the birth of new center of power real power we depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful and fascinating but they're making significant decisions you know laterally\nThere's also the question of whether the mission of these firms is as socially beneficial as many people believed they were in the early days the Internet there's old is really smart\nEngineers there the brightest computer scientists and all they're thinking about is how do I keep someone on Facebook for ten more minutes was the exact combination of things that will keep them stay on the site as long as possible so that we can show them as much advertising that's possible\n[noise] so here's a question if you are one of those huge dominant super wealthy firms what would you do to ensure that the good times steak [noise]\nProbably spend a lot of money lobbying politicians which yes they do it's been a huge ramping up lately in lobbying by ... [noise] but you might\nAlso do something a bit subtler\nStory today begins with a journalist\nFranklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books or talk about that for just a minute and\nAnd it and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a a science writer who wrote a book called moon walking\nWith Weinstein and it's actually\nIncredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because ah\nI'm sure with in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being\nThree brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but uh you know our our parents didn't do anything\nThey didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or sit down and study the great chess masters [laughter] we watched a lot of heat man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut what are the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to spend essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card that will at the book shop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was at slate one of the very first mainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft and so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nThere was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence of the Internet this idea that we were gonna tied the world together I Love search engines I Love the fact that I can access every book in human history\nIn a nanosecond I Love that I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things arguably make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life much better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention the pad and yeah and I found were incredible innovations and so I think we were right to marvel\nOregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nSo the New Republic but this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist Oregon and managed to persist over a hundred years while never really turning a profit and so as\nWe entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing\nTo continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next\nAnd I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up resigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard and co founder of Facebook\nAnd he bought the magazine and to me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media\nWho had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back and I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship in the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nWe became really good friends and it was exhilarating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and that maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris\nDecided that he'd always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we\nFrom last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and you slap a headline on it and you may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine and then if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school to suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular\nYou become obsessed with replicating that popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master\nSocial media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job and was offering other people jobs at the New Republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nThat's completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\n[noise] the reason the history of the Internet at least over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet it shifted the same guy who used to think this\nWas a certain amount of utopian ism associated with the emergence of the Internet and this I Love search engines\nThis Amazon thinks of itself as the everything store\nAnd it's gotten itself in a pretty much every conceivable business it owns whole foods it powers the cloud or it has this data for the CIA and so on and so on and there's really nothing that it doesn't try to squeeze into its empire he also thinks this\nAs Facebook shapes the way that we consume news as Google shapes the way that we interact with information and his Amazon has shaped the way that we interact with books\nThe dominance that these companies exert ends up trickling through the cultural intellectual ecosystem and with Amazon my concern is that the book business has become utterly dependent on them that they hold one of the future of monopoly is in the world\n[noise] actually it's not quite sure my name is ... not [noise] I teach at Princeton one course she teaches the economics of Internet the existence of a monopoly of a single so I mean any product space unless it's a government granted monopoly is",
