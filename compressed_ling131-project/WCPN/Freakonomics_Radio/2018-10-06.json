for\nMaybe you are an obsessive sports fan war maybe more casual fan and you follow just a couple of sports teams or maybe you pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV whichever the case when you do see those athletes\nI mean it's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nAs a full grown adult wearing the uniform performing under extraordinary pressure focused on highly specialized task has zero to do with daily life or at least your daily life but is that who those people really are and how they get so good at this thing they do\nWe see them on TV all you're seeing the outcome but what were the input we understand that elite athletes represents some magical combination of talent and determination but what about say luck oh my gosh uh\nI I yes absolutely I think like a ton of luck involved\nBut Shawn Johnson an American gymnast who's one elliptical metal and many other top honors\nKind of like this miracle math kind of equation has said equal the perfect answer I mean you you can't get hurt you had to be healthy you can't have the flu on the wrong day yet to find the right coach Wright city yesterday love for it at all these random things\nThe best of the very few and fit that equation today on the economics radio the third installment\nIn the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\n\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise to San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nI mean when you lose a game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a ton happens usually threes like Armageddon I'm\nTrying not in today's episode becoming an athlete\nTime to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened some scientific is the process how predictable will look at a number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both superstar athletes will look at will determination\nI did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was throwing up\nIn the mental aspect of this most physical pursuit to well I think the mind is is as big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools will hear stories of opportunities gained\nAnd lost in Nineteen eighty one it was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand eight teams seven point eight percent and we'll hear one story it's almost too good to be true they said hey you\nAre blowing up on Twitter you bought a voyage to grab you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\n[noise]\nIs freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even that ...\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field in sports or music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get so good how much of that ability where they born or\nHow much is attributable to hard work can practice and this is a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture\nRaw talent versus what's called deliberate practice we've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious ...\nGreat at anything you need both talented in lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because\nAthletic success like any success and leave money failure\nIt's what you might call multi factorial\nA lot of input in a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe\nReal life is more nuanced than that also more interesting so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs grew up in the Marshall project to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is I multi multi millionaire married to be on\nYoung men must sell drugs when their kids and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean he had a great\nTalent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I can go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThat should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that\nSeems crazy so okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with\nPhysical ability it may not surprised to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age\n... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star yes you are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete are going to be the best kid on your teams\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always ... uh and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child\nIn super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about\nThat a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and be trouble\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar athletes they both come from very athletic families\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shifting who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgeries and hands surgeries and next surgeries and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up and the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson he was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race ... 'cause I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports teams in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas Donald or is about\nSix to um glean a\n... guy\nThomas played basketball at a small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player and the college program was far from ... one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump and the best\nJumper on the track team a guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash um you wouldn't even clear bar a six foot six and a real competition and Donald says yes yes I Would\nSo they go out to the track and Carlos sets the high jump bar at sixty six inches Donald still wearing his basketball sneakers runs up jumps clear as easily Carlos move the bar higher and higher\nAnd I catch that thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is\nThis thing and the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave fencing thing the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill there's three different blade says ... soil and there's male female fancy and\nGiven that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers so it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college ... about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent may find\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else cuts and something like Fifteen fold we should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would still need to be very very good to get into those top schools\nThat said as an admission sweetener\nHow does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nGod if you want to go to an Ivy League school forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids\nPlaying high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned into sensors love it\nI used to actually won and us so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh\nClub in Chicago and\nI don't know his grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played\nAt Kentucky or do you would have been a topic and the drought\nThe problem was he played at Harvard we'll be

to go into the production of an elite athlete in Palin's drive from the right kind of practice maybe a parent or to to get you to the ring the gym or the track at five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier you might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach and the Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence ... Chinese born and raised Chinese\nUm when he was three years old and he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he kind of had this crazy career\nThat I Would say almost traumatized him\nHe he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left the China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian are lumpy ends there were also children and how to balance\nAt the different gym and I loved it it was awesome but chow my coach that took me to an ... opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching the they had to save gas money and I was really really last fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me say and I am forever grateful for that\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether to bad luck\nBore through something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled its more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this week of the next week and you go about it after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on it\nPlaying time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play um [noise]\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to power itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid ... is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural\nIssues so I look at these factors the industrialization mass incarceration suburbanization\nSo at the industrialization lack of tax base we know there's no funds to what construct and maintain balls feels so you see the rapid decline of the physical space in the Bronx in Chicago in these other uh urban areas which leads to a lack of participation\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm do that that course load is going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that\nSo instead you did with an American studies at American studies where in journalism right in journalism which just shows how easy what I Do is that you could do it and another major while\nPlaying football [laughter] no I I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nGood money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you are given out through the cost of your life\n[noise]\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox where he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him that twenty seven million dollars but now now the football for a few years he still feeling the after effects of his single mindedness\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends including family and\nAnd then I was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting\nI think it's a feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been\nAlmost ... focused on a goal which being focused on that goal like gave me purpose and I'm sure I'm going to butcher the nature the quote but it's something to the effect of\nA when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like I was\nDidn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I was single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I ... the people who are close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really\nFriends friends that she's been close with which they weren't a second grade and my\nAnd I'm like I don't really have that and like I was making these choices\nAh which I thought word choices to give me what you wanted right and I didn't realize at the time that I was for going like lasting long lasting relationship [noise]\nComing up after the break what does it set you back if you pursue the athletic dream and don't make it the person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years
