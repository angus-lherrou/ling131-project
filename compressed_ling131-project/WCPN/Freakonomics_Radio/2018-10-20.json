{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "[noise]\nLast week we were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind the existential threat to the big tech\n... my argument is against the big technology companies which really are racing to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago his book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nThat's since become relevant just because they fired a respect for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nIt it actually doesn't feel good because New America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavow them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel exactly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired\nHis name is Barry Lynn and he ran somebody called the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very vociferous critic of ah of Google\nWe used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of New America\nThis week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest of that messy story at no point did Google or any ... tell me to fire Barry land and we look at how corporations use philanthropy to shape the public debate and how that can go terribly wrong\n[noise]\nI'd have everything [noise] here's your house even now\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as journalists I worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we should say it was a pro business magazine [noise] we were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses\nSo we had a real inside look at\nHow low ... actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it with increasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty sixteen we had a number of folks on the hill starting to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem today in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problems since a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms doubt lots\nCases compete with that small companies so that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nThat leaves two concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market Institute but also it's apparent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies and risks of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convinced me to leave Princeton and and become head of New America which was a big move 'cause I had a a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our future\nAnd the digital age but as Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nI guess the question was ...\nWas ... hour work a new American problematic for Google Google ... uh Eric Schmidt who is the ...\nFor a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years she stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself between Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is a relationship that goes back to the early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense\nA year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination European antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor not\nLong after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website it congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we release this statement in support of the decision in Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty five I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Mary Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times\nKnow ask for this decision to reconsider noon and if it could not be reconsidered I ask for more time and I was told that neither of those was\nPossible the writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us simpler version of events he made it clear that Lincoln's statement about the European regulators decision\nThis was something that was a bit too far for Google and New America was very generous than supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly are outraged by the treatment\nOf berry and I can't resign from New America because I'm not affiliated with them or not to be any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nBut Anne Marie slaughter offered a substantially different portrayal first of all she says no\nThunder at New America has ever influenced New America content in any way\nAnd this New America has a set of principles on our website that makes very clear that that no funding can affect the integrity of our research at and or or or shape the research in any way way we do not pay to play\nUh we we take funding uh and we do our work and those\nTwo things are are separate but the timing of inspiring certainly gave the appearance that Google indoor Eric Schmidt had asked slaughter and or the New America foundation to get rid of Barry Lynn and his open markets Institute and slaughter found herself on the defense\nAt no point did Google or any funder only to fire Barry land and it no point did Google or any fund or try to influence the work of anybody here and if any finder every didn't tell me that\nWas the Stanford political scientist Robert ... we also heard from Anne Marie slaughter Barry Lynn and Franklin for [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio [noise] why do we choke under pressure that feeling\nMakes radio is supported by target

such a horrific where some people\nDon't even like to say it loud we're not one of those people yeah there's lots of different ways people can joke and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching rate\n[noise]\nIf we're going to talk about choking we probably need to bring in some psychologists\nEnters Ericson and I'm a professor of psychology at Florida State university here in Tallahassee, Florida\nAnders Ericson pioneer of the deliberate practice movement and the ten thousand hours idea have been studying expert performers for years\nBallet dancers gymnast and all sorts of athletes we've looked at chess experts surgeons doctors teachers musicians taxi drivers recreational activities like golf and even there is some research on on scientists\nDefined choking for me as you see it\n[noise] or choking to me is is actually somebody who cramps up an an and in some ways becomes unable to in a really act appropriately in the situation or or accent a very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as the worst performance then you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation and that's the on by luck I Am a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at the University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\nSo I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people\nThe patients for a success can cause choking and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching rate or if you're in an elevator and\nYou're trying to figure out what they're going to say something to the person next [laughter] you know we talk about these ethics moments of choking but it's a desire to perform at our best and situations in which were evaluated happening constantly\nGive me a little bit on the characteristics of those who are more and less prone to choke what about high IQ versus low IQ\nIn my research and in others we've shown perhaps counter intuitively that individuals who have the most ability to focus the most working memory the most fluid intelligence or actually more prone to perform poorly under stress and the idea is that\nIf you normally devote lots of cognitive resources to what you're doing and being in a pressure filled situation robs you of those resources you can't perform as well\nYou've just described all the reasons why I'm not very good at playing golf under pressure [laughter] and then let me just ask you one more kind of summary about surroundings um talk about choking in a ... you might call a friendly environment versus a hostile environment\nThere's research showing that when you have um friendly faces in front of you people who are supportive although that\nCould feel nice that actually creates pressure filled situations uh you often start thinking of yourself as they might and so when my mother in the room I sometimes think of myself as a young girl um and you also are quite self conscious\nIn a recent episode about the world cup we looked at the research into why there's such a strong home field advantage in most sports\nHe calls in home teams favor the research also showed that on balance athletes themselves do not perform better in front of the home crowd and in fact we see on ... tells us that friendly faces may actually create pressure filled situations you have to wonder if some dimensions they might perform even worse\nMy mind the research interest are behavioral economics ... sports economics\nThat's Alex ... he's an economist at the University of St gallon in Switzerland he recently coauthored a paper called choking under pressure in front of a supportive audience evidence from professional biathlon that is the sport combining cross country skiing with precision rifle shooting shooting\nGroomer analyze the performance of more than four hundred by athletes male and female over Fifteen Years of competition including world championships and the Olympics have they do at home versus abroad let's look first at the skiing portion\nSo we find that at home by it led the ski foster home about two seconds faster\nOkay so maybe all those home cheers do spur of the athletes to ski faster about the shooting\nBoth men and women miss more shorts when competing in their home country compared to competing abroad\nMen missed on average point one five more shots at home than abroad women a bit more point two shots\nThe restored mattress collection from grand legacy featuring organic cotton covers in a hand crafted pasta rice coil system designed to

think about choking under pressure they consider a variety of thought processes that may be subtle hard to measure economists look at joking but differently said that you would have paid me a million dollar you focus\nCan be very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in economics we think about two ways in which it's going to affect us the\nFirst is that if I tell you more you're put more effort into task and the second assumption is that more effort will lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that\nI can push you so much to to try so hard that it will actually backfire and you'll eat perform worse\nCan easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large states and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including India\nThe reason we wanted to go to India is that over there are money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they did\nPerfectly well each participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead ... creative one was for example to back pieces of metal into input books in an efficient way\nSome tasks we're cognitive and memory game in which I Would read up numbers you listen to me and then at some point to say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic\nThrowing a dark like Ken balls so balls or on a target and and things like\nThat the payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars and ten dollar was about\nWhat they made in a month over there I opened it to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make\nYou were Carter as can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics at higher pay leads to more effort and more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were structure you see reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in lower success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high incentives the success rate which is twenty percent\nTo the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives for the middle of packing game\nUnder low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded under high incentives nobody's succeeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT using students as a research subject some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you're doing it for long enough it's boring so he felt pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed more effort\nWhen you think about ... probably a rich your automobile have your your best and very fast and now he's saying really really making it high incentives you might actually start being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low and high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in Massachusetts as it doesn't India the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive experiments and up to three hundred dollars for the high\nSo what we found is that for the keep pressing task when you increase the incentives from up to ... stop to three hundred dollars they switch from about their forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding\nOn the other end when you have to add up numbers the more cognitive one we see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent so when you actually have to put some cognitive effort into this getting the incentive to be ridiculously high could actually be a bad idea\n[noise] this would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves some thinking\nWe're more susceptible to choke\nCore probably heard from a lot of people over the years coaches teachers and counselors of all sorts you are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way [noise]\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so how can you do that how can you prepare yourself did not crumble under the very\nCircumstances that matter most [noise] how do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on ... again going back to her Gulf experiments so we investigated whether going quicker for example\nThought that encapsulates your entire stroke might be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and that leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess of your buddy up on on the back and say hey that was a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great said so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke with\nWe also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so\nReally inoculate yourself against the high pressure situations you see this with students who practiced taking time pass a\nUC Davis with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions are going to perform under and you even see this if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players are used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium um\nAnd this is true in really big important situations but it's it's also true in those little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it while people are watching you know um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the kinds of all eyes on you\nOkay so put yourself in realistic and stressful practice situations with him rethinking how you're feeling so we know that when people remind themselves that um that sweaty palms and beating heart aren't assign they're going to fail but a sign that they're awake and ready to go\nIn their body is Jan Ting important nutrients to their mind that can be really effective\nIs that a charade or is that real I mean [laughter] if my palms are sweaty isn't an indication that I Am anxious\nIs that a a self lie that I profit from or is that realistically you know a counter truth\nFirst of all I Will just say that I'm I I like placebo effects and I have no problem with that but I think it's a real truth because you know if your heart wasn't beating to some extent you'd be dead right um and those sweaty palms can be an indication that you're alert an aroused and ready to go in a raffle doesn't have to be a\nBad thing right um it's it's bad when we start thinking it's bad and then we start changing our performance um what about other means of directing the mind whether meditation perhaps\nYeah so there's lots of research showing that meditative practices can help change how you focus in your ability to focus on what you want and get rid of what you don't\nUm that's true with visualizing positive performance outcomes ahead of time and really you know focusing on why you should succeed by what are the factors that that you've practice well you've you've got this um you've had situations like this in the past and they've gone really well [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "20"}
