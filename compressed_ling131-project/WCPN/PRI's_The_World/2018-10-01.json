killed but\nIt was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance of guess might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it\nThen a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work and thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in on not just where these killings happened but also the identity of the likely shooters those alleged shooter's are now in custody\nTell me a lot of people the b._b._c. Africa's security correspondent joins us from Nairobi are really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually crack this case\nWell I think first of all there was just the shock that gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning and it began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is it's anybody have any idea what the what this terrain\nA full on investigation I mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in and then getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean there are\nParts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is wide across west in Central Africa a botched\nWith many heads put together a one of them was Amnesty International the rights group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know looking at the uniforms\nListening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was\nCamry when this was northern Cameroon of course that's also a vast region\nBut over time trying to match the topography as you could see in the video there are ... distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and using those reached lines matching them to Google or in digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location\nThat's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that ritual on match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only original and that has that shape and all of camera room\nPainstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy but they won't so many clues put together so it's not just the rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue when you have another clue you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed but it was when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that an addict everything\nOpen source research group which is seriously experience on this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nFirst of all the government tried to deny initially that these were Cameroon young soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not watch um the the soldiers would wear up north\nUm they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army will serve on some of the the uniforms\nWere indeed ... military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and co found that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then in the dialogue is well some of the soldiers were seeing each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy\nBut around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest of the sudden people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had no official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nOf your parents still you know you've found church on Facebook Ryan yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier colds ... and apart from just to Facebook you know we found a way to speak to a former kind of ruined young soldier who also confirmed that this wasn't the Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to\nAbout ... and there's a point where I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of\nA tells this child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's the parents' fault or you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers are no forwarding these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are invisible what kind of feedback to this investigation has the b._b._c. Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and no jury itself\nThe feedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by the message you know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the\nAngle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fire up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a camera and then people in particular had been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\nThe video or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to uh to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen it festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nAnd it's something you can't really you race from your from your mind so uh it's

any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it\nBut you know they've just been transition there from a different facility they don't know anyone there disoriented you know the possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stabilizing\nYeah ... ... when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean you have any legal help with that connects us\nUm well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent\nShelters are provided with an you know your rights presentation um they receive screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues um you know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that\nAnd it is concerning minimum the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we had a\nSystem we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nFor those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the process doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's a chronic lack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful innocent but I think I'm I'm I'm you know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing a lot of visits certainly it's a different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously\nIt's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsored as soon as possible\nTrouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much President Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months one of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is\nOf the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen it happening but loosely the pediatrician and Washington a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule as a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who is applying for a visa or for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat include healthcare and Nutrition Assistance or your family could remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to child and family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nAnd this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even wake or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe to remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular\nServices so as recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old and as with many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so she was also concerned that her family\nWas not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined\nI'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S [noise]\nSo so I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support that they could get if their families were not being place in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean there's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately of an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so which which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family's they would not be able to afford the ...\nAnd includes programs like snap or food stamps that provides healthy foods and includes housing assistance I'm In other services that actually allows them to be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nDr Lon rifle Lucy a pediatrician in Washington with the Children's National health system also a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nThank you very much for being with us thank you for having me let's take a minute so you know about a remarkable story will have tomorrow it's about a man named Jesse he lives in California he comes from a Mexican American
