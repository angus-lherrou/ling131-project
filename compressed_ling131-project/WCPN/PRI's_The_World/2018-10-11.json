maintain this building\nAnd I do believe he wants to put people to work but yet I don't think he realizes the impact of what he's doing over here\nThen again see are RC now plans to circumvent Trump's tariffs by shifting the production of certain parts for China to the u._s. which could mean more new jobs not last\nAnd convinced the president's supporters he knows exactly what he's doing for the world Adam Reilly Springfield, Massachusetts\nWe take another look at trade tomorrow only this story will be all about North America dairy farmers and President Trump\nCanada what they've done as you
