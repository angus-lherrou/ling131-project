S. a record low kept under President Trump to making the lives of migrants coming to this country miserable\nNow Trump says he plans to eliminate birthright citizenship that's the idea that if you are born in the U. S. you're automatically a citizen it's not clear if he can do that the concept is enshrined in an amendment to the U.S constitution or the president told Axios he could do away with it unilaterally\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nMartha Jones is a professor at Johns Hopkins university and the author of birthright citizens a history of race and rights so this is all tied into the fourteenth amendment and there was an interesting history behind that could could you talk about what went into forming it\nSure the fourteenth amendment comes into being in the aftermath of the U.S civil war for a million ... former slaves are now free people and the question is who will they be in a formal constitutional sense with respect to the nation fourteenth amendment declares\nAnd states making them citizens of the United states\n[noise] so let's talk about the uh more in a moment I'm up because it's all part of of your research but it's just getting to the president's for what we're looking at today or a prior caseloads can close to defining or interpreting this from the Supreme Court the most important\nCase for thinking about this question is that of a gentleman named belong Kim arc\nUm there was decided by the Supreme Court and Eighteen Ninety eight one Kim ark is born in the United states\nUm his parents are Chinese immigrants who cannot become citizens of the United states because of the existing Chinese exclusion acts of the period but long himself assumes himself to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he\nLeaves states to do business in China\nAnd when he returns he's detained at the port\nAnd refused entry entry his case goes to the U.S Supreme Court where the court affirms that\nEven as long Kim arts parents cannot become citizens of the United states he because he was born in the U.S pursuant to the fourteenth amendment is a citizen\nSo it seems like we have kind of centered on the parents did do the outcome at the Supreme Court essentially defined birthright citizenship as we know today\nWell it did it in the important sense that um it rejected the view that one citizenship turned on the citizenship status of one's parents\nUm and so as a President Trump now I'm appears to be aiming for um those born in the U.S whose parents are not citizens long Kim ark is an important touchstone\nI'm just wondering what's to stop the government's revoking anybody citizenship I mean should that war is\nWell we know is that in our system ultimately it is going to be um some combination\n\nIf we're looking at them and we are likely to be seen other worms\nIn a in a God or I Would not surprised\nI'm Michael Barbaro that's today on the team from the New York times joined us tonight at seven thirty here and that he probably three double U.

GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world\nThey're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week we want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nGave it a name patriotic folding on line skates sponsoring he and his name ... says they send information because that just change democracy and where our lives are prevalent [noise] planes lighter truth\nLines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by James thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like\nAnd Southeast Asia is amazing that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse data in order to use it in the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a ... the woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of the ... their digital lives\nSo Maria wrestle we just heard from her more from her in a moment ... we've reported on the store that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually led to the violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo what happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to ... uh during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power of the platform helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and of paid followers that we're disseminating all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\nSo a ... a ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between ...\nNo no\nI think Facebook walk in to the Philippines and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that countries like [noise] countries way institutions are clear corruption is rampant these guys they don't have to see\nWhen you bring everyone onto him not informed and do not exercise any kind of rules\nIf you don't implement those rules for for ... and bringing chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow in addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently and as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug\nHole I think that that there are fact checking project that they are trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation have people on the ground that are fact checking material in the ...\nAt ... runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question which you raise several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's information\nFake news hate speech or what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at the age cue for Facebook\n[noise] well they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what's the standard for success here because there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in this position of having to take their word for it\nAnd whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know\nBut as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement and I'm Talking about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know the the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media\nPolarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world years that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who is in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important in lines which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention but it just so problematic so ... what are you gonna do\nJames Jacoby with frontline part two other Facebook dilemma airs tonight on PBS and you can find part one on line at P. B. S. dot org James thanks very much for coming in that you have\nFood and Jean ... and the Fifteen\nMinutes of June ...\nGender roles and\nWe're about one minute away from news headlines you're tuned to the world\nNext time on the democracy test why the breakdown of unwritten rules isn't all that\nPolitical scientist Judea is already points out the limits of the ... Congress that people just went and had a drink together and that friendship\nI out well I mean not to fine a point on it by those friendships we're all pretty much among white men\nI mean all kinds of checks and balances next on the democracy test for him to politics and [noise] and I didn't hear I only three WC pie and\nDidn't tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nSay over all although there has been expressions of condolence to the expressions of shocking of higher than the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact as it had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand\nYou know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play and had to come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm One of the stories that move me most was a story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that when he was shot and and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this\nInteresting custom dream order Scottish which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time but only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why does he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing up and that standing up together it's such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a cynic guy to give them Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of a synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't can act\nDo you know the president does reveal across the differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\n[noise] me think um [noise] that American Jews and Israelis are two very different path right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support\nIf you are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have done fairly well to themselves in in America and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still\nFeel under attack they feel very much sort of the product of sort of post traumatic host Holocaust world where they look at\nThings that very much and it sort of zero sum game it times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nAnd threats from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a transit of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splintered\nReporter Dina cropped with Haaretz in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the podcast the branch Dina thanks

organisms and um you look at a coral reef clearly we're losing more corals that we would hope and that means the race of change in the environment of essentially out pace the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six just months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was so gates was one of the very first scientist to make the connection between coral bleaching on global warming\nStarted in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none\nTying to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim ... research lab at the University of Hawaii but trying to figure out ways to help coral adopt to warming oceans friend Virginia was says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room I feel like she's talking just to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon\nAnd she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at if she really excelled at it\n[noise] I Know you've described her as an icon a closet or feel why\n[noise] so she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of\nAssisted evolution of corals very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate the heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that\nBut others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try\nIt then we can't know but personally I feel very strongly she was an iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues aside to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world of course\nIn the face of in the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events and the rest of the news isn't good I mean coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades and yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWell it's such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life\nShe just looked forward and she felt like you know we can try our hands up and give up or we can look for solutions then I think her enthusiasm really instilled that\nSame passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\n[noise] her laugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that field around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean Adam and she laughs she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and a longtime friend and colleague of coral researcher Ruth Gates who died last week Virginia thanks for telling us about Ruth and our condolences to you\nThank
