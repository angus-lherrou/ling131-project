sexual assault and harassment that may have helped some women in the hotel industry achieve that goal they'd been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault\nWas made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF of sexual assault that case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alice in it at a\nImagined is you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of the meeting all of a sudden your meal coworker starts to undress it's hard to imagine that happening right well if your hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not three times and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm going to put my key and I'm going into the room so this particular time you know I'm not answered isn't it I mean there's gas is standing there completely Nikki\n... she's a housekeeper at a large hotel in Chicago she asked me not to use her last name or the name of the hotel where she works she's worried about how speaking out my impact\nDiscuss the angry so I just kinda like bad up and just left\nShe recorded a tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much in housekeeping where your managers kind of feel like it was just a normal and they just say okay you don't go back to the rounds today\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that gas wasn't there but he wasn't asked to leave\nSo twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers some questions about sexual assault on the job she knew this was her chance to make change happen\nI'm like oh okay and one of my coworkers with it and makes them and she's like you know just kind of knows me like you know they come and talking about sexual harassment and I'm I'm like this is our opportunity to kind of share things that we deal with every day\nWith Tony and other housekeepers in the union set up to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job nearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest that lead to action last year\nHousekeepers and Chicago successfully lobbied for a device to keep them safe it's called the panic

take you to the far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting into can also be as easy as going online and doing a few searches the investigative news websites belly cat and the insider did both\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity a one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\nOur told her as one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had released about the cover daddy said this guy so we now know his real name is Alex ... but before he was ... and then as Oxnard Petra which was his cover a day so you know totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\nUm and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise] I'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information to discover identity from his real identity\nSo he looked into a bunch of database of some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're leaked databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find a few years now where to look inside cross reference everything we could find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth date and disarm roughly the same delegation of middle of nowhere\nSchools who knew him apparently he was a local DJ on before he went to medical school [laughter] yeah he he a DJ at the local club one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village so we once these hunters and these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity of Michigan\nI got to say some of the steps in in your process to you and your investigators are really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of um any vulnerabilities of what would leave a paper trail from a spy on Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information is hidden away forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so I mean yes maybe some of this has kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learned and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details a cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the cherry which when first glance it's absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on his driver's license to address the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA [noise] well he did it because uh you know if you get pulled over in his car to cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually no everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm an air traffic database we found there's three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five hundred fifty you all have the same register to address this one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address\nServices so really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy and is so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose that always possible right because from you know every time any investigation ... Russia people always China and saying well they wanted you to find the right [noise] well if they want us to find a wife no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration for these vehicles that year you headquarters [noise]\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new age of ... address same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second person allegedly involved with this group all poisoning I have is already in the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] um no no no not really at all I mean I don't really have any in I don't think Elliot our founder has any contact with you ... [noise] um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news and then we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy in the digital age\nIt depends I I again I don't know if I have no idea I've never worked in the intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site billing cats together with their partners that the insider and they say they've uncovered the identities of two Russian intelligence officers suspected of poisoning former rushing saw Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia and the u._k. back in March ...
