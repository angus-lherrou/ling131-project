where man this is the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nNow contesting America's geopolitical advantages and trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the chow go on column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not they they don't even wants to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hard line is here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiated with that America wanted to contain China and to stoke China's rise\nThat fringe of hard line is is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great ... of the top of this of economic totem pole America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging\nAnd they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful and this has come out of out of the blue and\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the dishes like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nThat's really I mean there was a a a retard very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all off the record so I Can't name but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to ... for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China went understood in\nDC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was something to this that the problem is that\nThe machine and Washington has kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently to play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the TTP where everyone opens their markets that bull\nDonald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ID so I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if\nYou know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table\nBut there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's\nWorld so he's a really interesting thing the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China\nChina is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and go and you know probably that's to be\nOne of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nThat's the go how'd they get that is not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one ... they'll try another if there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they were gaming the world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months ago trade tensions and you get this when he talked to a European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike more than an American led worlds trading order is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so then they realized that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of\nDoes all of these moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\nComments is the problem is that you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction or an absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because reasonably senior Chinese officials are now working\nTheir way down to list the people who can explain what comes to then they go so low down the list there are people like me and I literally have conversations with the more I say\nI'm going to pose a it's not my job to tell\nHarvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet\nSo she says this was an ancient Greek historian heroes about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably they weren't so he'd been analyzed a number of occasions of human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart\nAnd in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist and say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of different things from getting them I think he's not physically a kind of war like person these kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy\nI'm so they think that as people it shouldn't go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and bend the cup and there was this ... thing Donald Trump said I think it was at the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents have sort of been ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so see that's a really extraordinary statements in a previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in ...\nUp Hogan national older along with everyone else but suddenly Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric you're just not going to grow rice and the way that you don't you're going to I'm going to stop it that that is an incredibly bleak things for Beijing to hear\nDavid Rennie of the economist speaking with us from Beijing thank you pleasure [noise] news headlines are coming up and about sixty seconds this is the world and the world dot O.
