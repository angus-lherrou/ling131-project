like much but in terms of the global climate and how it impacts hundreds of millions of people around the world it means a whole lot\nScientists have been looking at how we might keep the warming of the planet to one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd researchers who just put out a new United Nations report on climate change say that goal it's still possible but limiting warming to one point five degrees Celsius or about three degrees Fahrenheit would require huge changes the transportation land use and urban infrastructure that are unprecedented in human history we\nReally need to start working very hard right from now if we're not going to see the auction slip away so the message is indeed a very strong\nThat was Jim ... from the UN's inter governmental panel on climate change which released the report the rules Carolyn Beeler is here to tell us more about it this report found as possible to reach that one and a half degrees Celsius target but just how hard would it be well\nHard as you mentioned that reports authors hundreds of camera that's Freddy interests\nWhy changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius that's because we'd have to cut carbon emissions roughly in half in roughly a decade and would actually have to reach net zero emissions and just Thirty years\nI just want to underline how hard that would be to do it basically means that we have to reduce carbon emissions enough by twenty fifty that anything we and that we can then sucked back out to the atmosphere by planting trees are taking other steps so that would be a huge undertaking\nYeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn has this report focus exclusively on the differences between one and a half associates and two cells in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nBecause those are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius was sort of thought of as this kind of goal\nBut in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen low lying island nation that really vulnerable countries like the Marshall Islands in Bangladesh banded together to push for this more ambitious target to be written into this global document so they got it in their\nBangladeshi climate advisor assemblyman real Huck was one of the people working behind the scenes to get that more ambitious target written into that taxed\nAt that time it was more of a moral argument that he wants to disabled people on the planet and not just some people on the planet but what we have low is a very very sort of scientific assessment of how much damage seem to be he's going to be to the whole world is just for people on the planet\nYou okay so what would two degrees Celsius due to the whole world\nThis report spelled out some really significant differences even though one point five and two degrees don't sound like that far apart for example um ten and a half million more people would be impacted by sea level rise under two degrees and hundreds of millions more\nNeeds to be all but destroyed whereas under one point five degrees of warming some would still be around\nYou and twenty fifty is just around the corner so this is this is really sobering news um and like so much of what we hear about climate change kind of depressing where's the hoping this report\n[noise] well I think people like ... ... email ... in Bangladesh been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time I would say they're happy that is still technically feasible to reach that\nAnd also that this report that so thoroughly documents the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on that more in dishes target which I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a positive

royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that William Nord house and Paul Romer were picked for their work on the most basic and pressing economic issues of our age\nNord house as a pioneer in environmental economics he started warning policymakers in the Nineteen seventies that their economic models were failing to take the impact of climate change into account\nNew York university professor Paul Romer helped create the modern approach to understanding innovation and how it relates to economic growth\nHe joins us now from NYU Stern school of business uh first of all professor congratulations I have you had a chance to speak with your fellow winner William nor does no\nI haven't I just wrote one of his nephew hoping I can find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him is just a great scholar and exceptionally decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nYour work is linked to the work of Dr north house how would you describe your work we're both\nProduce a little more corn or a little more week\nWhat Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that can come from discovering new things the real source of progress for humans has been the discovery of new ideas that gives you more of both corn and wheat so that's a unifying element in what we do\nYou know we have our own different specialization bill is really the one who's focusing explosively on climate change but you know I'm very supportive of that work and I firmly persuaded that the real key to addressing the ... of the energy system will be technological progress\nAnd the key to policy right now should be to encourage this amazing machines for discovery we have in the modern economy just encouraged apt to go tackle this very important problem\nSo it sounds like your body of research looks at the discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of Dr ... with climate change there's a very\nSimple model that would say something like oh the government supports basic scientific research by giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know they're they're keen on that but the truth is that most discovery and most learning comes from the work on specific problems and the academics often come along later and kind of clean up afterwards\nLike when people started working out how to use steam\nEngines to do work it was much later that because it's just came along and invented thermodynamics to figure out you know what the heck are these guys doing so it wasn't like thermodynamics led to the invention of steam engines steam engines led to the ... you know there was a real advantage to creating incentives for start ups and firms to go out and try and ...\nSay carbon based energy sources you need to use government policy to
