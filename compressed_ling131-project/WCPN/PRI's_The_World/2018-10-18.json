now so there's news on al ... case today Daniel what happened\n[noise] well the news is that the Supreme Court and Israel ruled that her student fees that should not have been revoked and she is now being released and her lawyer is on the way to the airport to pick her up\nFor tickets back and remind us what the dilemma was for Israel and for Laura ... who is she in what it is really special detain or upon her arrival\nAt the heart of this issue Marco is that Israel passed a law and twenty Seventeen that allows it to bar entry to foreigners who are involved and calling for a\nBoycott of Israel and so it's real estate lawyers said that al ... father is a Palestinian descent and that she was the president of students for justice and Palestine a pro Palestinian group while she was at the University of Florida and she present an ongoing risk of calling for a boycott walk in the country and until now the lower courts have sided\nWith the state lawyers but her lawyers said that she hasn't been active in that group for more than a year she's also said that she wouldn't support a boycott while she's in Israel\n[noise] so how does the kind of dominated conservative political class in Israel see the judge's ruling\nThe Hebrew University supported by our our cost of an even sent their lawyer to back her up but education minister Naftali Bennett he's from the far right the Jewish

two thousand Seventeen law\nSuit now Laura ... is free to go to classes\nEarlier this week some students quite an empty chair in class saying this seat is reserved for our our cost them and they wrote it also in Arabic and then that's fine with the faced by right wing ears so you can see that her presence in Hebrew University is definitely going to raise questions but she's also\nAn Emmy program
