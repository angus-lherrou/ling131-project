from the children concerning the allegiances of the parents\nDo the Han civilians who are in these homes and they report on their host to like some higher authority\n[noise] yeah that's one of the primary goals of what they're doing is a fact finding mission so they have these manuals that they're using and their spots in the manager they fill out whatever activities they've been involved\nWe are is that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be sent to the re education camps to get formal education were not\nHow are the leaders reacting to this well many many years that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes have told me that they experienced is a pretty extreme form of maternal is them a kind of in ...\nThey feel like it's a violation of their personal space and up their family life there particularly concerned with the way that the ... civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese weaker language is now something that's forbidden in schools\nThey might see their parents as backward which is what they are basically being taught by the state and we were parents feel as though they have no power to stop that sort of activity\n[noise] so how do harm civilians view their roles in this government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's it's complex because there's hon people that live in this province who have lived there for decades those people that are from this older group many of them grew up with leaders in school in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening to the leaders is appalling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWhere populations were polarized an extreme way and all speech and action was politicized\nSo there's a lot of concern there from this older group the newer group of people that I met people that came to the province more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential or many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pin that had Xi Jinping's face on them or\nThe Chinese flag they call each other comrades or sort of a patriotism fever among them\nAlso seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders like in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first so it seemed as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer kinda enjoying the privilege that they now have [noise]\nThe way they bring their final solution is lasting stability or long term security\nBut it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance and then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to the Chinese medium schools now that they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society\nSo their position is really quite fraught precarious\nDarren ... is an anthropology professor at the

he's taking a quiet approach to the campaign he has no election posters because he's afraid other Palestinians will tear them down instead he speaks in private homes in mosques and on social media and tablet hired a religious Israeli campaign advisor to open doors in city hall\n... for me because I have a market for it was\nRecent Hebrew University poll found that fifty eight percent of Palestinian

Jerusalem election is basically saying you consent to Israel's rule another Palestinian Aziz Abu ... announced a run for Jerusalem mayor earlier this year the world spoke to him and September\nWe cannot only complain about what's wrong here we cannot sit I we have to do something in action is given up and we were a few inactive\nBut Abu Sarah ultimately dropped out of the race he says Israeli authorities began questioning his right to maintain his residency status in Jerusalem and he says Palestinians opposed to his run threatened his brother's life Abu ... says he wishes ...\nGood luck I think if he's able to win he will break the taboo\nI think if he was able to win next election you will see three four five different policy analyst roaming and you'll see a huge amount of posts and
