S. it's become a political issue ahead of the midterms President Trump strikes that conspiratorial tone when he says hardened criminals and middle Easterners are heading toward the U.S those claims have no evidence by the way the Mexican government is handling the situation as a humanitarian one\nDanielle ... is a former spokesman in President Enrique Pena Nieto's government he's now a political consultant beyond says Mexico's government is currently walking a tightrope\nOn the one hand you have your ally and your biggest partner putting pressure on you and also record and I think the fact that you need to protect your own borders on you're you're only allowed\nBut on the other hand there's like the whole movement in the public opinion of Mexico saying guys we should treat the Central America as as we require the American roots are Mike Rounds up on the north\nRights to the Mexican immigration laws give the migrants right now we're traveling through the country\nLook that for decades Mexican southern border has to be very ...\nMeaning that we have like four years hundreds of thousands of immigrants from South and Central America traveling from Mexico\nWe have heavily invested in the country now we're southern border there to provide more facilities for new crossing and to provide humanitarian be set for those probably to the north\nAnd yet Mexican police fired tear gas at some of the migrants enclosed aboard or did you see that as a serious effort or just for ...\nWhat I see that Mexican police wouldn't or not they were having the shield sound and the guy said but they were not carrying guns because that was the limit they said like they didn't want ... least clashes\nSo the Mexican police had no live ammunition could Mexican police and security stop the migrants that they wanted to could they forced them back south\nThey could do that my guess is that they Mexican on Thursday we'll try to negotiate with them in order for them to apply for humanitarian be says\nDaniel how do you think most Mexicans view the Central Americans passing through Mexico right now are are they welcoming them would they accept them if they were to stay\nOn the one hand you'll see that a lot of people like come on people even like working class people try to immigrants providing them with\nFood shed there and what they're we have been into their own country for\nDecades we were the country that received so many Europeans particularly Spaniards fleeing from CBS wires and World War two but you'll still see some sectors in the mix ... saying these people

opinion they are not happy with the fact of the government just taking orders from another government ... so the Mexican taking\nOrders from the White House in Washington is suddenly died young young is a political consultant in Mexico city is also a former spokesman in the government of president Enrique Pena Nieto Danielle thank you for your time\nHappy to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador they've been receiving the said since twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent in twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars and financial assistance to the region\nWe wanted to know what that eight actually goes to\nSarah appears as with the migration Policy Institute in Washington\nSo what has this aid been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use for a wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country is the alliance for prosperity this is a program that arose out of a separate migration crisis that we had in two dozen fourteen when a lot of company in child migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these countries to cause people to to flee and and really have this mass exodus\nThe alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity in those countries and strengthen institutions they consider it a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries\nWe'll get stripped out of the budget lawn for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador ... the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress to slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but no he cannot do that unilaterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries he really need to wait until they come back in session after November\n... or how political do see this move being as it's only the Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran immigration he saw that issue when Hindi election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms so this caravan effectively as a political gift to him and Republicans\nIn that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country to quote unquote from this caravan\nTrump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle country and Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we have a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take\nTo report last month advocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like this care of and so that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog\nWhich stretches on for years so waiting in the United states and the way down the line\nAnd immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it's insincere asylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see a a more efficient system operating at the southern border so where we're working really hard to to kind of push out that idea and and stress the importance of granting asylum to those who married at\n... policy analyst at the migration Policy Institute in Washington Thank
