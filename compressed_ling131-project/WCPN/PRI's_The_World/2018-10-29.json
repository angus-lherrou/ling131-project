permafrost is important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the promo for that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago and that material in the ... is that old like it it's made out of materials from finds that used to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and let's start with ... sauce\nAnd so then one from a frost it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because migrants are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing\nBasically and then they emit carbon so it's micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter] basically [laughter]\nWhen living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn upper basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide freezing slow\nBack at the lake Matilda rose up close to a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe feed it onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty homemade because they are\nThe the way we make them floated by using poodles things from Houston swimming pool\n[laughter]\nSo you take your funnel turn it upside down rather piece of pool noodles around the wide part and put a plastic syringe on the top and you've got yourself a little trap designed to capture gases bubbling up from the lake below Matilda wrote us up to another trial and your team reaches over the side of the boat with a syringe and his hand\nSo he's pulling out the gas\nSo we have some middle leaders of guts to just used to be ... intellect sediments a words from the bubble and the global travel through the water into our trip out in the search\nDave likely captured a mixture of gases most of which will likely you're missing but we're not sure so we used to love and the measure the actual messing construction\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubbles trapped on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of them multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year\nUnder these particular conditions groups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation and they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nThink the the scary part that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon bookstores here in the firm\nFrom Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex but it's also hard because humans have never warm the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate scientists call him no analog situation a massive global experiment\n... but we turn on the uptick Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop for not [noise]\nIf you have the warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to salt and that is something that scientists are really worried about because there are many ah thresholds that you might cross there are\n... says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that to the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ...\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really dramatic consequences it's not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people and I think I mentioned you know something that's low disappear the pull up act it's cute but\nBut it's also about like us surviving as a species because if it gets much warmer act the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we\nLike the food we eat and where we live is just not addicted to it\nDon't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point scientists call it a positive feedback loop\nThat's another thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team that he thought there was any way to stop this experiment for conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage

choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um and one of the ways is to try and understand his experiment better and that's my part that's what we do here\nAnd the other part is acting on
