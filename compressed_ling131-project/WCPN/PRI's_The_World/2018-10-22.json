unravel the mystery Saudi journalist ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... by the president had been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than that and it would be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell it to you so\nHow many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis\nArms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\nWhile it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some deals are made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said or the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed\nFor our economy as a whole it's certainly not much I'm certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not only kill the journalist by is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saturday contracts Boeing and Raytheon you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nAnd there was a big here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages\nSo not all of us have gone through but after ... fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and they were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money has already slowed they've started delivering the fifteenth so the\nMoney as water under the bridge it's already been spent we're not going to see it again that would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might changes the deal for a missile defense system called fab\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and they have yet to agree on the details so\nIn theory the Saudis could say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military is built on us in UK supplied weapons communications maintenance and spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much is that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy and not all that has weapons and then the Saudi peace is a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very ...\nNumbers that actually are totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up I think partly\nHe likes to show up and sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people the American worker and you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them a in going after Iran\nWilliam Hartung the director of the

solutions but the sticking point was money\nMoving a whole town is a complicated and expensive affair one federal study pick the cost of living ... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars and it's just rough doesn't have that\nWater but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept the human caused climate change is even real\nSo finding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money and some grant programs buying up but uh boy it's just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change climate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly

of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and the course or or was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration

protecting people imperil anything that has a with climate change to it ah has to stop\nThen a few months later Clements got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications
