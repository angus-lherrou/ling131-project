make it\nAt precisely to Eighteen pm eastern time today all of our cell phone started beeping at once and flashing this text message presidential alert this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed\nAlmost all Americans saw that on their cell phones today it was a test by FEMA the federal emergency management agency for a system that the president could use in case of a national emergency got us thinking about how other countries do the sort of thing and the world's Lydia amount of leader looked into that\nOr is this something governments do is this normal\nAround the world yeah it's it's something many governments do around the world are they use these systems for emergency announcements everything from natural disasters too missile warnings\nAnd I gather Lydia here in the U.S there have been a quite a few privacy concerns about how the government's going to use the system\nYeah that's right there was actually a federal lawsuit was filed last week by the people they want it to block the Trump Administration from sending today's alert uh they said they worry that eventually the system will turn into a quote government control loud speaker in the home that every person a\nFEMA has said though that the system will only be used in the case of national emergencies\nSo I Want to get to how other countries use these kinds of emergency systems but first I Want you to tell us how long the U.S has been doing this sort of thing\nSo the first national emergency warning system started under President Harry Truman uh in the

include cellphone alerts yeah there there are quite a few countries actually ah in the Netherlands for example people receive text when their national emergencies Australia has a system where the government\nCan send morning suit\nOr a voice messages if you have a landline\nEvents like this tornado form of southern called ward's the lakes\nAnd having that feature where you can send your people text messages directly is really important in areas that are prone to natural disasters or like in Japan they have what they call the J alert system\nBack into doesn't love and win a big earthquake was about to hit Japan people got this alert on their cell phone [noise]\nAnd one more example I Want to mention is France because earlier this year they announced a plan to start doing some to start

very visible but at the same time France like many other countries I looked into still holds on to some of the more old school methods for warning citizens when there are national Americans\n\nDo they
