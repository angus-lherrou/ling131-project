for you will hear from the writer Jamaica king Cade on her trip to visit her\nAunt as a nine year old as punishment journalist Sebastian younger remembers his final story from the front lines of war and Josh Axelrod a former professional card player tells our first story\nJosh spent years is a card countered with a team of Black Jack players but the story you're about to hear it takes place well after that\nWhen Josh found himself alone in a tiny rundown casino desperately waiting for two lucky ladies he told the story at a mosque night called sense and sensibility stories about currency\n\nBe ready tidy okay [noise]\nTwo months ago I was in a casino in southern Washington state's feeling ill\nAre driven down from Seattle where I live now a friend of mine was was visiting Portland, Oregon and uh so driven down to to see him\nUm [noise] but I also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know and uh I saw those cars you know and the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was pulled over and ill in part because I was in a casino\nAll areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own\nGambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play a blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning of the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me as adults a hand he gets a twenty as his hand but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of two cranes apart screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to count cards for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of\nFriends mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it and stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your breast pocket of your shirt or jacket and you walk out with it and you feel physically enhanced with that happens\nIt's almost like a part of your body and you bring it back to your teammates we share our winnings and so you distributed five thousand dollars a year or ten thousand dollars trapped there and everybody gathers around ecstatic and it's almost like they're feeding off your own flesh and [noise]\nAfter earning my living that way for several years I sold a book about the experience of memoir um and I sat down to write it but I thought that I should procrastinate first and so I played a sort of like a little bit of poker on the Internet which\nAnd a lot of the twenties [noise]\nAnd I took this wide and just stuffed it down my pants that I was physically\nIt was in this ... this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers with the casino\nPeople who work there weren't going around and everybody there knew exactly\nWhat I had just one and they see me as a cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved to briskly for the exit [noise]\nAnd ah briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you turn to ensure I wasn't being followed\nAnd then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but it's the Pacific northwest so\nExpanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team linguist sense of\nParanoia averaging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining\nThe headlines in the distance trying to into it if any of the cars back to their look medicine and I kept asking myself again and again use everything going to be All right\nThank you [noise]\nThat\nJosh is the author of the actual rich\nRock is unfairly dark memoir of his life as a professional card counting blackjack player Catherine Burns them off the artistic director sat down to talk to Josh about its history with them off here's Katharine remembering the first time she heard him tell a story

he has to come do this at the players club at you in front of two hundred and fifty people instead of twenty five and then blasted the bless your heart you did agree to do\n[noise] card carrying story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person is in fact a lunatic\nWho thinks that he goes around waiting at casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or or in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this to groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd the stranger as\nIt was harrowing it's like a different body to experience you're there in the spotlight is on you're not really aware of your limbs or the rest of your your body and the normal way that you would be\nWhen Josh Axelrod was on a new play left at casinos he was appearing on them off stage ongoing assumed name Lee Aaron Blair\nI did a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because my name at that time still had some value\nTo sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as long as you know has become increasingly aware of it um but also because it's long been obvious to me the card catalogue viewed legally changes his name should change it to three or more first name's presents a piece of ID to a person in the casino\nHe can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id [noise]\nTo hear the rest of this interview and for bonus material

[noise]\n\n[noise] I uh first one too\nShort stories and trying to wait tables and I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man\nThat I felt war would be a exciting\nAnd intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand dollars and I went to Bosnia\nDuring the civil war Sarajevo to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying words the civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by served paramilitary forces are and ... they took her up to a field above the town goes to a record\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat and what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stayed with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to die to die\nLines that it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to freak out I got in a jeep with a few ah Sierra\nLeone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight\nAhead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was ...\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the boy comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot and another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes and they're so small\nThe thickness of a pencil and the attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze\nIn combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave\nAt Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about bull is is that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you\nSo much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters the first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at it gives the sound the bullets make when they go past your is pretty subtle\nAnd then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking in everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags or gear was rights right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to\nMe it shows like bullet proof vest that grabs this stuff is throwing a mode of soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start\nTim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know\nWar might be the only situation where young men are free to love each other on reserve easily without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rich in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of heal up So Tim took the next trip he was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but he was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know\nAnd in the middle of all that same broke his leg he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get\nHammered here's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst is in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well and started it started with this scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came\nUm scene where I riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nOr riding in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up he went off
