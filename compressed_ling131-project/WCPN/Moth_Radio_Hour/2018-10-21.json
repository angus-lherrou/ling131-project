I was like yo lady coolest I'm new here\nAnd there was a kid in front of a class with him as Brad hey turn around and looked me said\nDid she say Osama bin Laden\nWas like no she didn't say Osama bin Laden\nHe was like All right very next day I go to class right walked right up to me is that I talked to my dad about you how the girl boy or a bad\nAre you an al ...\nPublic no I'm not not ... he was like All right thank God we can be friends then\nSo maybe you start to Missouri was a very very difficult but not everyone is bad actually made a best friend the first day his name is Brenda\nBrenda was great he had moved to my town from buffalo Missouri and he moved there because his dad was a preacher and he was going to take over the local church and Britain was great he would later become the captain of all the sports teams at high school\nAnd he loved the town he said Omar you're going to love it here everyone is so nice and friendly like for example I just got my hair cut at this guy named Troy and Troy is the best okay he talked to me about sports about church you got to go see\nSo then that day when my dad picked me up I was like dad\nLet's go to choice for haircuts so we went to Troy and Troy is\nIs a mobile home with\nWith like a barber chair in there and so we walk in and there's a Confederate flag hanging up\nAnd my dad like if you'd better leave and I was like no down we're going to stay Troy is the best [noise]\nAnd he was like\n... like\nWe're not taking any new clientele\nAnd you'd better get home before it gets dark and I was like this business model is flawed [noise]\nNo one in here [noise]\nAnd my dad life worker and we got back in the car and on the way home my dad didn't say anything\nAbout it and didn't need to we still haven't said anything about it to this day because he must have realized that he had taken us to a place where we didn't even feel safe getting her hair cut\nAnd it must have been especially taxing for him because he was a strong Pakistani man he cared about family more than everything\nAnd\nWeighed heavily on him but over time we really started to feel like we were a part of Missouri people there are super friendly and kind even though they're pretty race us [noise]\n[noise] note this person that says they don't believe he's ... the person that screams the loudest\nSteps up to the pundits round layer maintenance for national storytelling sees continues [noise] nah\nThat's coming over the top of the hour\nOn nudge you point three\n[noise]\nThis is a moth radio hour from the Iraq I'm Jennifer next in our next story\nWas told in Sioux Falls where we partner with South Dakota public broadcasting the theme was big night at the morphine feeder and our next story teller shared a story about her big night here's Kerry Adam live in South Dakota [noise]\n\nSo when I got married I was a D I why crafty crazy person from the minute I got engaged I became obsessed with the details of the wedding I thought it was an opportunity to show everybody who we were as a couple and not that we were just perfect for each other but we had perfect case to\nSide dived into research I was looking up at cakes and photo booth backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason ... was invented and after all my deep dives I was ready to go I started the invitations I hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation\nAnd I'm nailed them in on the lips with vintage stamps I picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad got a salute to the military stamp than I had just scour ... for a vintage WC Fields for a funny friend\nAh I may have some Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but\nAfter those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache so I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay like created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter]\nAnd all the little talkers for the twelve cakes we were going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nShe thinks he cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed didn't orchestrated it and send it off to the bans and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise]\n... that's what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which of my grandparents wedding anniversary\nThey had been married sixty four years when the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us the same good luck and we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard so on April twenty fourth\nWe hung olive twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars\nPut out tables in my beautiful center pieces\nAnd on every seat lay down a custom made played bell I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season [noise] I was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shape of swans when the tornado sirens went off\nAnd then came the rain and then hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pieces\nInto the mud six months of making them every night and they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nLuckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter] that's the only time that's lucky by the way up but\nUp with the big shop\nAnd we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in and we're ready to begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get into little cart I made so we just proceed without her [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI was looking forward to the song you know I've I hadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nMy favorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash\n'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus but I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies amongst all of this the worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle\nAnd so he said I'm not going to be there and\nI had to step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called them and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nOn his only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding\nAnd that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself\nHe looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should have been and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise] all of our hamburgers fighters just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm it finally passed\nI mean a star friends singing a song from ... to do and and also how the pains jump around [noise]\nAnd so after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle police max and the specialty cocktail I have made which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nIn fact it was our friends and the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married\nThere's some things even take can't fix maybe\nIf I hadn't been so caught up an olive the preparations I Would have realized that\nBut there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and\nMartha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't end with one\nWe were married increase corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did he\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends stamps and the pedals\nSo we missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean there are people who think they are a scam but I Love wedding\nI Love the details and stuff and I became a wedding planner [laughter]\nI've married about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them they've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days I've added more and more pins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head\nAnd so if I ever get married again\nWe're totally going to a low [noise]\nThat\nWould carry Adam [noise] in addition to being a wedding planner Kerry also runs an online store called the plumb fields shop and\nHer dream to be a magicians assistant I'm just putting that out there for you carry all it takes is one big breaking to see some pictures from Kerry sweating all the MTV Neal visit them off dot org I keep meaning to

W CPS\n[noise]\nYou're listening to them off radio hour from PR acts I'm Jennifer Hicks and next up our final story it's another from our show in Albuquerque with our partners K n Debbie here's Tristan reef live in New Mexico\nIt's a bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner this he's just ahead of me on the past and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now have this\nDo you want to have a baby silence\nHe turns around and I see that he is laughing at me\nIs the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby in his defense uh we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley ... had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that teased a freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nAh the second reason that he said no because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nUnder a for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive\nA and I could transition and that could be happy\nUm which is what I did um [noise]\n\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nUh and it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not\nOrder I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nAh [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse and he's a pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it\nAnd there were two lines and I was pregnant and there was going to be a baby you know dogs but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHaley and why we have been toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby\nUm and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like they have sort of my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nAhead and made around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly um and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um\nUm because our lives our misery says the media and I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there's hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there's also joy and love and and Brazilians and in family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if he wants to read that um CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe just as good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nBecame really good friends with the ... because I\nA man at all I'm just a really ugly Harry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman\nSent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you\nI was six months pregnant when I read that message\nNow I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years I'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise] um I think that I'm resilient and and strong and and powerful\nBut the truth is I started to lose hope for our country and and for trans people that we would ever be loved in the way we deserve and all of those stories started to seep in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "21"}
