was really really hard to go viral back\nThen uh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nSo and you have to do I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um it was really hard time in my life I was sad all the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join in the activity but just\nOccasionally

I'm Jennifer Hudson our next story is by a special ed teacher we first met any can at a story slim healthy not far from her home\nHere than a lot of [noise]\n\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of gotten negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity acting all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down\nLearn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker\nAnd when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\n[noise] and\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China\nKnow but we're here in America I thought\nI couldn't ask that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause of Rochester right\nBut I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was excited to watch a PBS documentary about me becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nBefore that I'd seen three people who ever looked at like me Jackie Chan\nShereen either yellow power ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about\nPeople marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding ... signs in English they're chanting in English\nI never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything so big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who was being said that\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job\nThey fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nOf going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people\nAre now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us\nAnd so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American Asian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together\nSo my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... will and says\nThat's your family what\nHave all these questions who is he how is he related ... like a cousin or because another cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met them because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nShe didn't look like he had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask\nAbout a murder man and our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking of articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured have\nJust for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes China set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue choice unease at some\nMoments during the documentary you could see little each in trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because of this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family or someone who spoke up\nTo be a bought again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who\nEach in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where ... lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit [noise]\nMy friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to see even sanctions grave\nWe she drives us\nAnd we find Vincent ... name on a tune stone lowly chains name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone\nThey're no longer goals\nThey are right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related\nSwallowed dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on this list is slowly kitten so now I Know the legion is my grandmother's sister lowly chin is my mother's first aunts and Vincent Chin is my mother's first cousin\nSo I asked my eighth grade ... who what happens to lowly after Vincent Chin died\nShe tells me well when Vince inside lowly was all alone in Detroit\nSo your grandmother and I literally sisters flew to America from China to support her your mom and dad had married in China so your dad came soon after they all found work in New York and that's how your family ended up in Manhattan's Chinatown\nI thought about this for a while\nMy grandmother had brought my parents to America\nName is Elaine ... I became a published\nA newspaper columnist\nAt the age of twelve a primarily because the editor didn't know how old I was\nHe told my aunt when she delivered some news to the paper that he needed a columnist for the neighborhood had happened that I Lived in the paper was a weekly and it ran neighborhood columns [noise]\nHe said that she knew anybody there and she said yes she did actually her niece lifted there and he said you think you should like to write and she said oh I'm sure she would he said well hey you know\nFollow the format for these neighborhoods things and send a copy and if I like it up print it will go from there I did he did and I went for oil I wrote it\nAnd was when I took my copy and and he'd smile and wave\nAnd then one day when I brought it in I think I was by that time I was fourteen um he said oh how was your mother and I was puzzled lead and my mother he says yes your mother Elaine I said no no my mother's me go I'm Elaine and he looked at me kind of funny and he said how old are you\nAnd I said I'm fourteen he just oh my God how old were you when I hire Julie I said\nTwelve and he just thought that was the funniest thing\nSo we decided since I
