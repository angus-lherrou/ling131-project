sponsorship for them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow\nLocation in Paris than has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there for about Twenty years before we had gone there either\n[noise] the climbers we're used to a massive peaks and dangerous ... faces but still as their helicopter descended into the ... valley and the yellow came into view they were blown away\nProbably would impact of this and the notice that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than mountains are then everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nThat's Jason Smith he'd put the whole expedition together and was the de facto leader of the group there was John the photographer bass the world class and only female climber of the group and her boyfriend Tommy who was the youngest of the four for tiny yellow wall is the first big sponsored climb\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle and I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably when John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and his patting me on the back and asking me if I was\nA soldier they looked at him and the kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like having among the switch shoulder and they're like ... will die like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and up to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they pray and they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge for a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to release\nDictator type figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of my from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nHe explained that John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was getting out on the phone and called the Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned that John Day you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back in my suffer pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take\nMatters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murder somebody I very much\nSaw them as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nJason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashed in their schools are stabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and ...\nFor dinner if you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and ... and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker Iraq and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of their captors are they're split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers when they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and\nThey did this for three days starving and I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and you start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and\nWhere you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken extra time it was and we didn't guesses and it turns out that have been five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nDid have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive and do seem to have no\nHere's the deal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was sue the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together it's summer there was safe and obviously mess that he had bought the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad Denali served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he would have Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to not go see he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off they split\nUp do tracking down towards the Base Camp will Jason and his crew lets see up the mountain now it was four to ...\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere was just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to ... and the anger named the knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids as I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since there was the middle of the night and so John and I'm immediately\nUm\nYou either\nAnd I'm always trying to find a I'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth\nAnd the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing up to class and it just so scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all and but as I was reaching out to grab his gun struck the sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out I grabbed his gun strapping a poll as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them in life and he turned and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact and the whole way down\nAnd so he has the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound is really loud and then he tumbled off in the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just started falling um [noise] and then Beth [noise] showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\n... you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um [noise] and I remember saying like I don't know how you could love me after I've done this\nI liked it I can just go and\nFrom work that you gotta you know you had a source of joy and it's like ... down it\nAnd then too was always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with a male formation in his brain [noise]\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with grand mal formations\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but ... didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time when the ... became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone\nOr you know I'm without his input I felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say that I say about it and do you remember what you might have been scared\nOr just knock that coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is when I was real scared of\nA different person since I was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous\nWhere is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all men are familiar\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure even if they help you know\nThere was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regrets about my own dreams because I still\nHave symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute compare it to him that one of my biggest regrets surgeries and and my surgeries it's not\nIt's made me a somewhat better person at times [noise]\nUm\nSo and I get a little fish will start to go with you there's like\n... okay [noise] um\nSo in like Julie ... story with

had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated he's family his mom and dad Steven ... had to decide what to do the they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey searched his name is Dr

recording it because she could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nYou know it had some risk associated with it about five to ten percent chance of a major complications from surgery or
