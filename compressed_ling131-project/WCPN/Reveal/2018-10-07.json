you say [laughter]\n\nYou said he's looked at it because of the ... explain them well\nWas arrested in a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nHere's a seven years and years of job like an attorney\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office use the habitual offender statue back then when I was going on and on\nLack of a better way of describing it was just when it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use to have that too often or statute it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or a hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's as mines that are the more before we locked up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem on his father's from the from the ... you know harsh sentences or the turn\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there a ... office still uses the habitual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at is the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your ... that's just started every way you talk to the prosecutor to the judge to even the considerations with the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge or leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred

[noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da da da da da and your lens or about the same and so they're demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon cannons arrow\nAre losing a shorter house or oh you did you ever been to so I'll be going on ... on Wall street\nHillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is there it was private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me others will soon as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything is public safety can you ... certainly with no charm a Jew or goes public sector really demand ...\nThe ten years he's been da has office has used this law sixty six times now let's talk about what ... does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law\nI shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\n... I never heard back in an email the d._a. spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's ... so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nBe remiss if I had what I consider to be a prosecutor case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call that's what you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nThat it is it is the law I think I ever responsibility to prosecutors if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing in New Orleans [noise]\n\n\n... lawn is I'm just doing my job why is he doing his job so differently than any other da ...\n... just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Kenneth Jones than\nAm ... I ... a criminal law specialists\nAnd I heard that really you go by ...\nMay be a Jew a big you would do a ... a ...\nYou know this is my ... my ... room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stacked by his computer tape to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry counting came into office\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait wait a minute you did did you just say Harry comic the jazz singer no that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nWhen Harry counting came into office he use multiple below two shows up in this issue of society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of their lives\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric ... quarters to use the powers of hers offers to help ... system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against ...\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and\nThis law back from when ... when do start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any person shot a third ... be convicted of any crime you should be considered as armed forces I envy him isn't that a labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that a vigil center laws really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to imagining the conflict as scary African American man\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated an penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for forced labor forced labor wow\nYeah and this leads us right back to a biggie before he became an expert on the law he fought in the Vietnam War where he also picked up a drug habit and when he returned home to Louisiana I think he killed a man in a botched robbery something he attributes to his addiction and untreated post traumatic stress\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a use the law in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [noise]\n\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story which is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case here a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert violence\nThey'll team he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy said my hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison [noise]\n\nAfter I requested to interview prince he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat his addiction our connection was in great\n[noise] when did you do the first one\nToo so that was like six years and years [laughter]\n\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs [noise]\n\nJust wasting time sitting in one dormitory with a hundred and twenty people doing nothing\nIn seven years you've got three to go has anything changed for you\nReally love ...
