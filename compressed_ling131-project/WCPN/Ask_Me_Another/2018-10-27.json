enjoy\nAsked me another NPR's our puzzles word games and trivia I'm Jonathan golden here with public ... now here's your host oh fear Eisenberg\nNow many for his portrayal of sponge Bob square pants on Broadway plays won't eat then later [noise]\nEven welcome thank you for having me so exciting to have you here so let's start\nFrom the beginning of your spongebob journey yes verify with me where you were and what you were doing when you received the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants\nI was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah goes after the brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a plush sponge Bob Dole that lived on that being back here so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call\nAnd it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer\nAnd they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title teen Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it\nThat hurt I when I heard a little bit I've gotten over it but you didn't know what they were talking about oh no they\nThey said the name of shepherd shift and just to we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm with the guys I got this audition how cool is going to be him and like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob do in the hands by like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob\nI'm that is a crazy coincident it was it was really wild you go to the audition\nKind of get ugly voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right yeah that was like both\nI'm a conscious decision as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure uh I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me\nSo I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important\n[laughter] cool for cocoa\nYes he said you were you were sitting at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and Juliet did you know yeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like\nA huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah and I had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of this workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid in DC and so that that was something that I always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it so I think Tina for being the reason that\nI chose the obvious paths [laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now\nJumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense\nSo what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been ... six yeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years\nI I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned was great yeah ... right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah\nAnd yeah when you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gasp yeah I'm not saying that I can I get thank you to a you know John at the notion yeah my contortion teacher amazing okay\nI was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh\nYeah it was a lot and you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it is made you a more optimistic person hopefully we totally yeah I mean it's hard not to I I mean I I have the privileges you know being the sponge\nTo an hour shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's\nBeen a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yes and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like\nReally proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one people tend to be taken over by their fear and\nGoing to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself you know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days that feels really like a river [noise] uh\nAll right are you ready for an ask me another challenge yes I Am fantastic of course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the Tony nominated book writer of sponge Bob square pants\nThe musical Kyle Jericho every body\n\nKyle thanks for being on the show as well happy to have you ... okay so you you wrote the book how many years did you have you been working on this project I think I've been\nInvolved almost six years okay yeah here's what is the evolution of the story of sponge Bob square pants the musical what is the evolution of this story has it changed from day one yeah it has\nI mean we knew okay here's the challenge writes about my TV they're eleven minute episode yes Broadway show you may be aware as nine eleven minutes long just a little longer a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks the emotional stakes that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening so pretty early we sat on the idea there was going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right and then the exact version of end of the world changed a bunch\nBut we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob\nSpongebob has fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that is going to destroy it and people are freaking out they looked at each fish are perfectly fish for sure you have to clarify the I just saw myself and every single one of those fish\nI'm old and even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home which of course seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this entered the script\nWell you know interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy this world is the only land mammal right there are aquatic mammals there is a whale but she's the only land mammal thank you I like you know I don't mind below so that if this person I mean you on it [laughter]\nSo anyway we always thought wrote a story about people turning against each other dealing with fear the idea of scapegoating somebody it just you know that's what happened yes so she as the outsider seemed like you know really clear way to tell that story sadly the world has really caught up and I think it's felt even more\nRelevant than it did even when we did in Chicago a couple of years ago right art art imitating reality\nUh so we have a game for you Ethan and Kyle your game is called take a sad song and make it better [laughter] and to perform your clues I Would like to welcome Tony Award nominee for the music\nOf sponge Bob square pants the Broadway musical our very own Jonathan\n[noise] [noise]

anything or was it no it has kind of a tower and I kept dreaming about a chair and children's winging this tower and then I drove by it on the highway 'cause it's right by the tunnel and you're going into Manhattan and then I guess\nThat's the building that's the tower that's those are the children here and the children's wing of the power is a terrifying I mean I think an empty kids chairing a tower\nThat normal size chair [noise] Jonathan around [laughter] [noise] not worried about that [laughter]\nOkay so but you seem fine\n[noise] and they do have a recurring dream or nightmare Lindsay's
