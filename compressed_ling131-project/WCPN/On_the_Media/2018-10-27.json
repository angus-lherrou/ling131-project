former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell to be honest I think that are totally sort of the second stage as this\nAccording to a bar tolo and I have not been able to confirm that there were other people who have planned much smaller care that he saw information about it on Facebook and decided to get in touch with those organizers\nHe had to lay tenant experience and facilitating\nImmigration um and so he got in touch with them verified it and then he shared the post on Facebook according to a bar told her what happened was there isn't any two hundred three hundred people and then there is news report on hunters is most watch cable news network called H. C.\nComing on dog sees when I got to be identified\nHim as a leader them up by the bonus Wednesdays and then when I look in and they are to nearly said that he would be paying for food and other causes are people\nThat are not going to ... you know the gospel and when I'm In Iran\nAnd he said he got tons and tons and tons of cause\nBut you know I don't think that sort of the explanation I think it helped dark things and get them going but then all of the other factors for why people migrate contribute to why it has helped out in the way that it has and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people\nBut he definitely credits that positive news report with the initial explosion\nOn the report from HGH here is what ... told you and I'm I'm rooting for your story in Honduras the government\nIce and the opposition not the conditions that they that is the government created this is in line with with the United states is saying that there are false promises being made and this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people really just need to get out\nThere is this right wing

our boys\nWant caravans they like to get revenge a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan but that has been debunked tests are not\n... than multiple fact checked on it first day on the video and by the New York times like there's absolutely nothing to back up that George tourists just paying anyone on the care that\nI Believe that it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed at that and that's really not unusual considering the local support that we're seeing her migrants here in Mexico and the town it's like people get there\nAnd then along the way they see the last out water than at a close ally now for me yesterday and then it's like I said all people came out and we're giving us toys underwear all these sorts of different

sent the video footage to a Republican congressman who immediately tweeted it out\nHonduras domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plant that false explanation\nThat explanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period and by the charge eight affairs\nThe closest thing to be ambassador to the United states around hunter is is that this is funded by the opposition of hunter and that it is sort of a political game that people within the country are playing\nThat sort of more than a line that I've been seeing raised in Honduras which makes sense of the country is extremely polarized and then they just had a political crisis last year\nWhere there was a razor thin election and the machines counting the

will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWhen did\nHe's a woman can enter a woman's knock\nOf wondering that in down town privacy and the ant man [noise] going too far [noise] it's an almost ...\nSo on the other side it's a question many themselves trans went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there is no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nMore able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from\nA friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation\nWith him so once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other app groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knock it out recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys\nThree days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had the conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not\nThat treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of about Fifteen percentage points if you have\nAnd the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve we see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those a trance phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive\nMore over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy of the matter of campaign theory\nWe're actually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine move from putting leeches on people and telling the anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to buy my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow up work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers who have to fan out\nThey're an advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies hold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign or twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really\nThink about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors\nThen it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy the normative leap we might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team but you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of\nEngaged individuals want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nWouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results that's kind of a trap that that research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant who's been in for a hundred years we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nYesterday had done something else which of course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so\nWhen we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries with that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and you know reorientate other activities around it within the next year on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that is very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates uh will be interested in applying in their work\nThere but thank you so much sure thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist at the graduate business school of Stanford University Matt Collette has been reporting on the
