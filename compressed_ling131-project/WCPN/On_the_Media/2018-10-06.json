for all of the logical fallacies used by the culture to excuse or ignore bad behavior we called on her\nAnti bandwagon fallacy it's something that kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news items curious content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerged we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were poor memory cases in my wife especially against one\nSo the question is if there was something ... going on was or hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah when more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that could be a bandwagon [laughter] that invalidated the initial accusation something else that I heard recently it is the ... effect or technique which is a way that a lot of people who are accused\nRespond ... stands for deny attack and reverse victim an offender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to carrying every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting

stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with

they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven [noise] talking about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic vary by heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope I reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation the leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota was nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas when to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just\nPassion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point when did and he was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared at Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby off of the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nJust as we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents arrived they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nDon't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nThe trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had done a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing and timber in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... trashed the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank Carlo chi one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or is this a lot that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to joined that caravan\nAnd then that was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have the virus in order to be heard\nAnd they did [noise] there'd been a number of\nVery high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] are\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it I did\nAim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German of Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military build up everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom were not native hostage\nAnd then later the hostage just had we refer you to go to any time we just didn't want to go and we figured if we did go to the government would kill all the Indians there actually brings us that [laughter]\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise] in my mind\nIt's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show\nDavid

actually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German meaning states were either\nUnder military

homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off of blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the late Nineteen century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ...
