personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced\nShe set because there she votes were Hi was it and did that she was Native American in July he escalated I won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by trouble if you take the test of the shows you're there\nThis week Warren responded by way of five and a half minutes ... campaign video in it and she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genome we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence package asked us what we have a Native American ancestry or in your editor\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated she came out and thought she scored at first and showed in the media\nAnd it sort of the men and Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are used to the DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nBoth the right and the last appropriate and accusations\nThat she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before\nWhy would a university to use her to bolster its diversity Bonner fights a political miscalculation but also a stumble into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere is a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess when their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim tall ... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us as a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual lands and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe know in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA\nAnd ever since talk of blood is lineage and said have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest at the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be\nTrust between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture I\nCaution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you are looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but does allotment acts at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has a ...\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their ... these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment to govern ... what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base thrill you're talking about families that were lifted at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nYou see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I Am one thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and a rabbit hole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for\nSolder doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the system often ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base room but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining around the whole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the ratio inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father is non native\nNow if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to want it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards linear will defend rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with us\nTo a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something ... she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his\n... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma in the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nRight but but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them\nWhy do you think they do it\nI think they are very much influenced by that one drop rule that is so prominent in racial discourse in the United states\nI have one drop back there somewhere therefore I can make a claim that is very racialized thinking\nAnd again native people in the U. S. are not completely exempt from that we struggle with that because it's imposed on us but we also have this much more powerful way of identifying that's about can ship and try and citizenship [laughter] that helps us mitigate some of the\nAlondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of DNA race reparations and reconciliation after the [noise]\n\nAnother application of genetic research and another kind of controversy twins disease on [noise]\nOn the media is supported by target preventing future at heart a podcast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart a veil\nWeekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon\nAnd cultural commentary his is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nStick with the facts weekends muddy points to reach WCBS support for nutty point three W CPS is provided by yellow light solar based out of Cleveland yellow light makes solar more accessible for residential and commercial planes in the mid west\nMy offering systems that work on any budget more yellow L.

gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background\nI think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I did\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like not says twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut

end identical twins weird part or identical twins who different some white and help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and manage disease [noise]\nYou've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins who are born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota at the same hospital as the other twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin one pair for twin and the other I went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the\nReal identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life histories are amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nDid his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary [noise]\nSo what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small sample I Know\nBut yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things\nIn terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in the small town who should have been raised in Bogota\nWent and got himself a GED a high school diploma and is now finishing law school so we always had the drive he didn't have the opportunity but I have also become very appreciative of extreme environments and how they influence behavior I think that this is a very telling case in so many ways\nSo some of the myths that you
