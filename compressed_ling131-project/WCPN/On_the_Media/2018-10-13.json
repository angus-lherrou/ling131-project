this kind of new thing people a lot of people living in a place altogether needing some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of settled community

educational film we heard earlier\nTo do business five barter and that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of extreme\nOnly problem is says now we're no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence of simple barter anywhere in history\nYeah so the ... story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story\nFor money and kind of set forth into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious

we want to believe that the market as it exists today\nAnd that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's\nSo it's great to justify current conditions but when you start kind of\nCracking it open and start sort of peeling back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting in a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting
