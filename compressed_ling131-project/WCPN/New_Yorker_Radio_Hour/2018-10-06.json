I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women have been treated for so long the way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nIf you look at the way flake change disposition afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subject of Rebecca Traister is a new book good in mad revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post\nAnd her last book was called all of a single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation Rebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the\nSenate Judiciary committee has done its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as as as we near us and and others in a very particular meal you as well [noise] what did the specifics tally\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view\nOf cultures around wealth\nWhite fundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the ... you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite um friday\nOf extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on paths toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good mad you ride very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf\nBut more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um [noise] what's that you often [noise] um it was an attempt to\nGet my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nDidn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was\nAbout this before and um there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been ... by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer\nAnd there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said about the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her\nWhere the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leaving be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women to not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys would that going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also thinking about white women and what impulses and messages\nOf waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here but everything was so clouded [noise]\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dries I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes oh maybe that's what you need to write about is the anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months since\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplar of\nConstructive anger in the book historically\nA black woman I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours and her great hats or Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till that's not by any coincidence that's not have the smart by accident\nNot at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice and for him to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean up Polly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Murray was credited by both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial\nActing and are trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nAnd Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name for its Kennedy ... years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem are leaving either she ... she and she and Gloria Steinem we're speaking partners caught on the road yeah right ... tell us a little bit about four it's kind of so Florence Kennedy\nWas a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\nFor her time but I think she would be outrageous now shot in her demeanor and her willingness to\nBe vocally pro family\nUnapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nYou know you wrote a book about a time when you're you're working in a male dominated office mhm and you found yourself in two years you're angry and

investigated by the U.S Secret Service and stuck himself wants to fraud at a bank in Maryland\nRobinson recorded his calls was Stuckey suggesting that he might have been suspicious and yet for over a decade up to the time of his death he sent Stuckey hundreds of thousands of dollars his kids lost their inheritance and his wife lost the house\nA city you know you cannot send that man any more money
