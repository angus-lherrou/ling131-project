I was with my family you\nI have a huge family and so I was just with them a lot and I come from a musically inclined family my great grandmother's are both play or in Indiana what their charges um the church was it was a huge inspiration from\nThe ... did you sing in church there in ... in a way that singers that I'm from an earlier generation did their way to reach that kind of grew up knowing the music of Sunday Morning on Saturday Night\nYou know I did sing in church but it's not the type of song that she was think would be something in church it's not tradition ... no I actually was that five six year old kid\nWho would be sitting in the few and in my past her would be between yelling and sweating and about to get the holy ghost and I would bust out in the Michael Jackson to beat it and then I'd be escorted out to the children's church [laughter] kinda got kicked out\nYeah I was ... I was a rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records in radio\nI did have access to musical theater and what else did you play as a kid I was Cinderella I can totally yeah we did we did a production or I went to a predominantly black a high school Latino a Latino and black high school and\nUm you got all the lead singer I didn't actually funny when did you not get the lead the whiz I did not get the whiz I wanted to be Dorothy so you're still mad about it [laughter] I'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me\nNow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a may be the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatic\nRealize that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an axis potential that was there and that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell us your story who we are heroes with that Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah ... Judy Garland were were my my my heroes are pretty different performers why those two\nThey were just women that I felt really use their voices you need that first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland\nObviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that\nUm I feel like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life\nBut Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and made a career fully being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from\n'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not have a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a singer\nOr she was a producer she was a poly math and now is how I wanted to model my career\n... ... ... what's your song from an early album that's called violet stars happy hunting and this is from an album called metropolis betray sweet\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOut of a musical is that what you said after right [noise]\nYes you know what well I wouldn't say a musical where I wanted to do was figure out how I could sing song\nHalf concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched ... Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it inspired all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that\nBy the stars have the hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take how can I take all of me onstage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing love aren't the love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressing and is black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love\nDavid Bowie I just got into bully at that time I loved pink Floyd the ... the wall I Love\nIsaac Asimov I Love science fiction how can I blend all these these ah these different elements and and innovate in in in the space of of a music ...\nYou had in those in those early days an alter ego Cindy may weather why is that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um\nA a complicated thing which all that you are [laughter] um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in the in the latest um dirty computer was\nSaying that Cindy Mayweather represented represented aspirations for me that's who I strive to be more like I'm not so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she doesn't have eagle all the things that\nMake me imperfect she's able to master those\n... so this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used to being self critical about and\nHere they relied right oh that's not commercial enough\nThey didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was it I was doing and just what did they want you to be [noise]\nI don't think it was about wanting me to be something I think it was really about not wanting to do the work in the development that it would take\nTo figure out how to bring something new to the industry it was like the quick thing would be well you know change your hair one change her outfits need to sexually be appealing\nA the songs also that you know they shouldn't be so dense they should be more simple and assess a bowl and\nBut the temptation to fold must have been something financially and in terms of fame and all the things the rewards the record industry can bring the temptation to kind of compromise a lot must have been significant\nOh yes oh my goodness are you kidding me I'd just been fired from Office Depot because I was responding back to one of my ah three fans that I had at the time\nI was singing on the libraries that live in the house with six other girls in a boarding house um you know driving my Mitsubishi ... selling my CDs outta my trunk I needed I needed money you know I needed to to be able to grow through yes I Would I Would have even want to go home what would you do it Office Depot\nWhat could have happened\nYou know thank you so much ... thank you for having me\n\nDirty computer is the title of Janelle ... most recent album you're listening to the New Yorker radio our more to go [noise]\n[noise] [noise] and\n\nThe New Yorker radio hour is supported by twenty three and me a personal genetic service\nAnd by the wall Street Journal providing news and insights about global markets politics tack and the arts and the wall Street Journal read ambitious lay membership options and more information at W.

the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter Eliza Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and\nIs a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards and they're really unhappy about it one of the communities the laws of visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAccent\nIs a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we saw Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and yelled for al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we're Going Rogue\nWere on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of brac inside and final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nHave you heard of him running for office Danielle excuse orange now you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party\nUm there are one two three four five six rows\nOf pipes\nIt's within five fifty feet in my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and\nUm we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids\nFears about it impact your life um [noise] it's\nHorrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania and it was a snow cone pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\n[noise] of like my like burning in her bed [noise] and um [noise] I called him and I said John we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there are only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics just an example\nOf the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to\nMe it just wasn't something ever\nLike\nMaybe I thought it would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but\nAfter all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us\n\nFifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics are both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state\nIn America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including Snowe go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline refinance or top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline follows me for ... with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP is a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline moved natural gas liquids\nFrom the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas we were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of accident in the small town of blows or fail\nAt blooms gun shop we met Ralph and Doris flew\nTheir shop as a small building in a modified garage on their property or shot guns are mixed up with things stun guns in Cedar and its infested was criticized\nThirty five years and make a joke you like it is it going to get any better\nIn where we have no water we have another drink and drink and drink or two thousand Seventeen there's our water behind it that we got back then that's the way it come out of the biggest it's black and\nNobody plain words because he was maligned would\nGet his grade I went to our co burger which is our state senator three times for help nothing\nWent to the blue more representative I think three times nothing the last time I went to a boomer took him to bottled water over and show them how to drink this is what it is he actually come out and looked at the damage to did\nAnd nothing just don't do nothing\nI reached out just to know go to comment on issues related to the pipeline but they didn't respond Ralph as a registered Republican but he voted for Hillary Clinton in the last election because he said she would have been good for the gun [noise]\nBut to us the bigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of akin to edit things you make there are kind of common sense will judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make comments that are judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we should show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like gosh I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant\nIt'll ever need better trained\nThem down so we're I mean the the plane the plane was down Daniel red cliff jak a short restaurant reviewer tables for two written by hand a gold field herself a former checkered\nShe was very pleased to hear you can check your face [laughter] yeah way he'll see gas yeah cancer\nConfidence shortly view of a restaurant the Mexican restaurant called ... and when we started a new checker we sit them down with a manuscript and have them under lined up for what they think is ... fact and what's not\nWhat did he writes the underlying details from\nSo then she wants you to track that and that's the kind of thing you could both stew off the website and then check was chef yes and for your call is set up with a dull Evan\nReply on going to say that Ron I collect chilly\nBut she never heard of a a dissimilar to the beaches soupy have what you do you also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment of Mary would us back\nOff and maybe in the ass yeah because like lava China yeah well ... yeah well we want to be telling\nYou this research to it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem with that is just absolutely if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach I for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like in California beach is like um\nNephew to end with this will set up a job interview or to switch careers like they have a much easier job right now [laughter] so that's pressure\nAfter I saw that Daniel ... I've had a good from quick grasp on what was ... was not I walked around the corner to help him work with pardon gr Henry another the chapters done one of my deputy recesses\nAre in the high dollar guy how I exercise like I said when you marry them on the\nFirst national park or and Daniel went to the Oxford multiple website where they looked at a news prices and photos of the restaurant\nRight on yeah yeah and you\nKnow I was even ...
