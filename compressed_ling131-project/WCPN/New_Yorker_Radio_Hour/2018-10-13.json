{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "The Manhattan or certainly covert action in the New Yorker WNYC studio\nTo the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick when we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that\nThe election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems and altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is\nIf somebody really did want to ... the election it wouldn't be impossible not at all Sue Halpern has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all Logan lamb\nIs a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election he started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems which ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that\nI did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections dot Kennesaw dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentations and this this particular\nSearched didn't turn that up instead I found it very curious links and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought while but that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected immediately\nI thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of lamb also found security hole through which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters I had access\nTo their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\n... and there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bone answer to the scariest scenario\nI can think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters an attacker could of compromise that Web server\nAnd used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n...\nWasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system\nPublished the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence said the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cyber security experts citizen green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which count paper about those are all the computers and those machines\nCan be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure\nOr the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet and I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here at the races here's how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies\nBut there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia\nThat purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't votes\n[noise] personally this has been a concern for me because uh on\nElection day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you are at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pull books was a vendor named the our system now the our systems had been targeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county to county report and has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker or malfunctioned\nBut I think that's an open question as to what happened in North Carolina and election day [noise]\nWe heard earlier in the year that a three hundred and eighty million dollars was being released to the states uh for election security uh can you talk about that like is that going to make a big difference in the midterms in twenty twenty at all\n\nSing and all this ... um well ... been kissing me so long [noise] another\n\nAnother way or\n\nAnother well yeah\n... ...\nWho's the beauty of beauty isn't it ... do you ever ... you say you were texting within ... about the songs that they do how much do you tease out what the song is about oh I didn't\nThrough a certain number of political moments\n[laughter] sixties and in many moments in between ... and\nJust how does this seem\nSimilar a different [noise] um issues I couldn't have dreamed us up\nAll the stuff I've been through and all the countries and all dictatorships and the you know um and do all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you believe me thinking how am I going to conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying ... no problem no perjury yeah not a problem\nI'm In ... that that is a new normal and how\nHas it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning\nAs yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to it a law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety anxious about the state of the world which is terrible\nAnd so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial events of the great advice yeah and um don't expect much and keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary get forget which one it was because the ... the scene appears in so many documentaries abusing the march on Washington I I I just wonder how you\nBut you you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen it was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment\nYou know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea I think that of all a political moment\nYeah I'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these literally aunt you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hint then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in yours and mine yeah\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I\nWent to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in his in his slaughter and it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama when too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a\nOf a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that not only is the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies but he's able to sing the song\nUm yeah how do you remember that that terrible incident and watch you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering the song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future the song just dropped out of the sky threatened by the way most offered I did not know and most people didn't know um [noise] I Need to tuna\nDidn't get started talking\nI mean if I was quicker attuned you can only be knocking that guitar and you're not getting your hearing it loudly\nAnd just go ahead yeah okay ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ...\nYoung men came to our house of friends and they didn't know what brought him he\nWas not friend he was not keen but they open the door\nAnd they let him me\nAnd for an hour the strangers sees that he's that with them many seem to print any\nBut then a young man to God and nine the bull loaded on yeah [noise]\n[noise] Mm Mm Mm Mm\nCharleston in the month of June ... ... mourners gathered in ... the president came to speak some reports\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation and ...\nSo on that day and\nPresident's ...\nAmazing ... cheese the president's na\n...\n...\n... ... ... ...\nWe argue would lay the blame\nOn one man hang around nation shame some sickness but the minute or so and how we\nMight be made hope\nNo one could\nSay what must be said and for all the living and\nSo on that then he's the president has sang\nAmazing ...\nMy president\nSang a may ... Singh ...\n[noise]\nYeah the last line is my president which is just switch yeah for that President and vice president he says is the only president you felt of this and that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether I was going to use that are not cause though we wrote it um my president I thought ... [laughter]\nAll of them they have to lie cheat and steal don't do all this stuff um but yeah it'll be states' money was smart he was carrying in spite of whatever\nWas um a lot of it it was just somebody I liked I like um ... uh yeah I met him I was in the middle of a snowstorm and it was ... and I went and I met him and I had was freezing out on my feet has shrunk\nAnd I couldn't keep my high heels on they stuffed things in there for me you know I caught and wander you were\nHigh heels to the inauguration ... very cold that\nKick them off and went barefoot [laughter] usually go to the ocean all your feet shrink and you're going to be slipping and make noises all the way to the president so I went barefoot and made him very happy\n[laughter]\nYou totally embraced the idea of political songwriting and its connection to politics do you get into the social world Bob Jones or the other thing he ran away from it he wrote some of the great political yeah songs of the time and then did his very best to either\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nHe really was a tree romantic Hitler loved poetry he loved ah he [noise]\nHe did tapestry\nHe stitch the most wonderful\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nHe loves the history of ... old explore as them he glamorize that lives said his head\nWe face a fit for\nNo\n\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways ... was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self he set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nFor for my\nUh\nThen that we of it\nAnd on his other ... most famous expedition that Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great price\nTo be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship the difference that frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was he was able to guide all the men in his immediate party and get them back all home alive\nI can say I know that they have loyal to the very for us I I Believe I'm four\nYears I was very interested as a child is also the story ... ... calories and it carries a very very devoted expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition which very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer ... and the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had ... pounds when he came back from a trip to south Georgia just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave\nIt wasn't until\nWhen he was about forte that he does it really took about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nBy the time that Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alicia initially when he decided he was\nUh you know his kids were a little bit but we'll do it but a joy and it was very supportive\nBoth of us well huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time my rich still he's from fulfilling your own individual dream\nBecause you've failed you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that looks at some and he went in the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town really\nSuffer his third trip he wanted to walk across that Dr cook to fulfill that goal that his hero shock then was not able to achieve but he wanted to do with a low\n[noise] especially if there was a really\nLong time all the sudden boom the trial or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the mornings pack up his lead this usually took about an hour the hardest will be connected to the slide and you begin to haul the Donald Michael mule\nFluffy and scream for Ninety minutes I'm going to take a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories than a day\nOr every craving to fish or a shovel early statesmanship small chips or trying to protect her ex wife story\nHe would do this for it to lean on task and challenge the day after day there was frustrating almost primal about a cold warrior singular\nPurpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was the ultimately accomplish his goal\nThe nine or ... or hard one to travel long ago today just tribe or another ... miles of the funny thing\nEverybody Twenty one employing ... ... but it's only known them all there's all I can do the night when you go a day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice it's possible for losses\nFor actually jacking up his ability to see the bridges me this morning it was a very tough guy for many causes for breath waiting for a ...\nStroke seven pm or ... where am I urge college during the day and it was the lead on some little subtle but I Am I checked again was twelve festival nine\nLong enough [noise] [noise] [noise] like two to him or not\nHe well he was at that on a satellite fan\nHave stand it much harder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people and you can take time to be at the front\nWhereas if you're the lead scare\nPress has miles [noise]\nHave time to quit playing they had\n\nTo sell the constant strain of making his mileage so that he could reach the point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and start to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Eli shuts down then and at that point there would be no exit\nSo there was nothing except for will serve to them all those\nLayers you would have colds recognize those laws are joke if they go to the feudal Asian guy will\nSays July ... years old\nI listen to his blog every day and they were pretty good they were pretty up beat but uh I was just very concerned that was the highest miles on his and he was old uh [noise] he was fifty five when he says instead of [noise]\nShe could hear him growing more tired\nBut you wonder what you should do [noise]\nHe worried constantly constantly that he was being\nDelayed [noise] I was in a terrible position as to whether to say\nAn right just a lesson from and that you know going to make and you cannot make the end or say you'll do die [noise] to really difficult one [noise]\nI chose to say I'm sure he'll be gone [noise]\nSo I enjoy watching it last night a Starbucks\nBut now he's just her body was in ... his his back sprawled all his muscles a he was suffering from the early signs of frostbite especially in the system which he struggled to move he had lost more than forty pounds\nWhite House decided to stop a rest stop [noise] risque well either law allows you to listen to all these all these ... lost to\nHe kept a diary a personal already this when he didn't broadcast when he didn't he wrote legs are sticks and an arms puny\nUnder her age I mean I was",
