three we explore the history in popularity of the guardians of traffic that's during Ninety four three two featuring the sound of applause [noise]\n[laughter]\nWelcome to Latino USA I might gain a horse than our show is going to start with a story about family and war and the things that we tell each other about where we come from\n\nJesse ... has always been proud to have been named after his uncle according to the story in Nineteen Seventy eight in the middle of what they might as dirty civil war the government murdered his uncle and they handle Mendelssohn\nHe was one of hundreds of thousands who was victimized last succession of brutal regimes\nAre you in debate was dramatically interrupt and friday afternoon with the emergency announcement the five thousand Indians and a Guatemalan village were about to being murdered by government drove\nThe civil war in my mind that lasted for over Thirty years the U.S backed government was fighting leftist rebels\nForced disappearances a suspected\nSubversive were comment and many innocent people got swept up and killed at the hands of the government Jesse grew up on this\nVersion of this story the one where his uncle died unjustly like a casualty of war\nWhen he recently visited one in my lap Jesse started to ask some questions and he discovered a much more complicated story than it ever imagined\nAll your mother said that\nShe thought that maybe the people who killed him where part of a death squad\nAnd that may be they shot him after a bar and fight\nAnd as far as my dad knew the fight was between my uncle and the son of the mayor but beyond that the details were blurry I didn't know why my uncle had fought the son of a mayor and the Guatemalan city only that he'd been standing up to what my dad called an oppressive government he says that this is why the people who killed my uncle dress them up in a military uniform\nAnd tried to say that he was a member of the insurrection there\nEven if the details weren't certain a mother remembers very clearly the day she found out her brother was dead she didn't find it in person or be a phone call she received an express letter in the mail from her father\nI ... I started reading a letter in the first thing that my father said you know dear Shani indeed slated I'm telling you that your brother or they handle had passed away and I my God I just stopped there and I started crying and I probably went crazy I don't\nKnow my mom and called her other brothers to ask what happened\nBut nobody wanted to say anything but later on my brother he said to me when we went into a cemetery where some sun you're so I'm there in one came and took to me and he said you know we know when you find any so just even liked that\nHis family was told not to ask questions about it at all but how could they not\n[noise] [noise]\nQuest to find out what really happened to my uncle started in twenty eleven when I visited Guatemala for the first time since I was a kid to my surprise my family and Guatemala seemed as clueless as I was about how the hundred died no one had more than a piece\nCentral America longest and most brutal civil war has come to a man for the past thirty six years left us rebels bottled Guatemala's army\nPiece was finally negotiated between the government and the various guerrilla groups so he ...\nFormally accept a deal but when I went to his name was called he stood up and was shocked by what the woman reading his name said to him\nAnd he ... he saw yo yo man when it comes on I mean do they do know is is ... ...\nThe woman told the Alex that he couldn't possibly be the man she called he said yeah that's me I'm a humdrum and those are the woman told them but you died in Nineteen Seventy eight Alex asked a woman to read the maternal last name of the man on her list\nWhat is it a little baby or liberal and vale does it may get off a little more\nShe said Marta solely to hit it I mean by that turnout looks realized she was talking about his father Alex Heard the un read off the name of two more family members that day but he wasn't sure whether to believe that so many relatives were secretly ...\nAnd this is ... ... ... at least that's what I see the ... yet and yet then\nI like as a guerrilla fighters inflated their membership rolls innocent civilians so that they would sing bigger than they really were even if those civilians had no affiliation with the insurgent groups in real life so it was difficult to know whether my uncle or ... or anyone else in the family was actually involved in or [noise]\n\nLike meet my cousin's curiosity grew with he got older and a few years later he started his own investigation into what really happened to his dad his quest to come to a ... a town with a family recovered his father's body\nHe spoke to retired gorillas in the area and local law enforcement and the stories he pieced together it was very different than the one ... told me this story makes more sense if you consider how dangerous Guatemala was in those days and why my family might have wanted to hide the real reasons for my uncle's death\nRate of ... ... if you if you get ... and we're not seeing\nFrom what Alex discovered what his dad died on a farm all trying to collect the famous\nImposed on people so it was more like extortion donation and this is where it gets complicated\nSomebody must have alerted the locals to my uncle and his friends were coming because when they arrived\nMembers of the military would there waiting for them when do you see in that I don't I don't get us Adam\n... look as as helping me if I was going on with that ... it'll mess people ambushing them and grabbed his father as soon as they entered the farm you know they use the alec says this is where his father was killed me about that is feeling about that on them I think that\n... hundred adept with a machete like they hacked his neck and they hacked his chest until it's heart hung out of his chest muscle and in fact you then you had to put us on the waiter [noise]\nSo one version of the story has my uncle dying in a bar fight one that started because of a love triangle and ended with the government accusing my uncle of being a guerilla fighter\nThe other version is that he was a guerilla fighter who was extorting people and ended up mutilated by the military given how different these two stories are I asked my cousin about the origins of the bar story\nAfter all the bar room version wasn't any newspaper it was what my uncles told us\nAnd NATO but as soon as I mean a set of baking no for an hour that's they look at it as a city of ... up I thought I'd go back to\nMy cousin said that after his father died people threaten the family and told them all not to talk about what happened Alex things maybe this is when our family decided to tell the love triangle story instead and he says it's okay for them to have their version he's keeping his gaze again 'cause if you don't get your mic addict will meet you\n... ...\nGoals were the truth can be down\nBut I didn't expect was that people could come to prefer the smog\nFrom my mom excavating such awful stories about her brother is something she wants to avoid which is partly why she's only returned to Guatemala a handful of times in the last forty years\nAnd I noticed that some people said that to me right on the on language or you don't want a ball\nI don't want to remember that\nIt's strange to hear my mom said that\nWhen naming the after my uncle my mom ensure that neither of us would ever forget his murder\nNames like memories can be powerful\nThings to reporter Jesse and they had their control for that story Mm\nAnd now we're going to turn to an interview that I recently did with one of the most know where the

Garcia Dwayne yes and she actually does work in Mexico city\n\nOther accidental deaths and she looked at their brains and she's compared their brains to the brains of you who have died of similar causes and less polluted Mexican cities like better crews and she basically finds that they have brain structures that resemble people who have early stage all glamorous\nDisease so she can actually visually see in the brains of these young people\nThese changes which she\nBelieves are tied to the air pollution that the children must be you know breathing in as they live their lives and heavily polluted city like Mexico City\nSo in the report the term environmental justice is talked about a lot of it and it's been around for a while but just to make sure 'cause there are different definitions what exactly in your view is your definition of environmental justice well\nThe paper that we published and environmental research takes a perspective on distribution all environmental injustice with which has to do with how\nYou know health harming pollution is distributed in space and then how certain social groups are disproportionately exposed to that pollution in their neighborhoods or in our paper in their schools\nSo CERN just to kind of end on this concept of environmental justice what might justice look like for for these communities that are challenged\nSo I think it's really tricky because we can't just shift the pollution around [noise]\n\nIs evidence that as the ... environmental justice movement was achieving some success in the Nineteen seventies in the Nineteen eighties\nWhere you know our backyards we're getting at least somewhat cleaner in certain parts of the United states that basically what was happening was these burdens like waste incineration was shifting from the United states to other countries [noise] so it's not in my backyard versus\nProtect our children you know remedy environmental injustices that have been perpetrated against people of color in this country for a very long time has to happen in terms of reducing the pollution everywhere and for everyone and not just you know shifting it on to some other less powerful person who then has to deal with that [noise]\n\nSarah thank you so much for all of your research we really appreciate it thank you [noise]\n... ... is one of the researchers behind the national pollution study she's a researcher and professor at the University of Utah and now for the fans of the\n... original series east last time Emmy nominated actor GED part of who played his dues is back in a new ethics theories Mayans and see\nIt the next chapter in the sons of anarchy sad\n[noise] like", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "04"}
