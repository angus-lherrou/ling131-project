you know people post on Youtube videos of themselves playing games yeah and then they other people I Love to watch yeah I don't I don't understand why but yes yeah it's like a whole thing I Do get it either but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nAnd like driving a forklift around and trying to pick stuff up and like put other places yeah but when I think it's funny too and I want to show us like if you look at the comments\nThat people are like giving tips so like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast but it feels like they do when you're in close quarters and warehouses maybe thirty five to forty miles per hour someone else's like keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from tumbling off the forks I'm a forklift driver\nGot all these people they're commenting like actually drive forklifts work less and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts and that's because one of the fastest\nGrowing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing\n[noise] we're going to start our show by diving into one of the fastest growing part of the American economy it's warehouses [noise]\nWarehouses\nHardly in between space that all of this stuff from cat food to fuzzy socks flows through on the way to us and the industry is exploding\nThe twenty third team then\nPresident Obama visited an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee and he gave a speech about the future of jobs in America with a particular focus on getting a better bargain for the middle class we've been fighting all\nFrom the worst recession since the first\nAt a cost millions of Americans are jobs homes and their savings and what is it was it it laid bare the long term ... that's been happening when it comes to middle class you're\nTalked about bringing back manufacturing jobs but he was also there in Chattanooga to highlight job growth in other sectors Amazon had just announced that he was hiring thousands of workers for its warehouses nationwide\nNow over the next two years experts are saying that the warehousing industry needs to hire over four hundred thousand workers just to keep up with the growth and e commerce so the jobs of tomorrow are actually warehouse work\nAnd many of those jobs will be held by Latinos and let the nuts currently in about forty percent of Eighteen to thirty four year olds working in the where housing business are Latinos\nBut are these jobs that are taking over or the really good jobs I mean are they really a pass to a stable middle class life the way that manufacturing jobs once were\nOffering immunotherapy and other personalized treatment options to address patients individual needs\nMore about precision cancer treatment at Cancer Center dot com\nBack to let you know usa I ... you know last time and before the break we heard from high school students who were learning to drive forklifts\nYeah but he's a car is taking us to a real warehouse where these young people might work one day\n\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reached out to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility gave\nMe a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase automation [noise]\nAs I entered the building bears justice wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway and there are signs everywhere that said no photos\nOnce the guard left me and I realized the free time tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nThey just under a million square feet [noise]\nAh we also have way more than a hundred full time with it\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to four yeah who introduced herself as a community specialist I'm not\nSure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associate entry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise 'cause we're\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like road which is good because\nI'm going to suffer [noise]\nMe will be another one in a minute we call them ADD\nGNVs automatic guided vehicles basically it's like a forklift loaded up with item button\n\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as an ally but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're not person shaped robots more like big orange room but\nThey're square and on top of each of them is instead of shelf which holds items\nTo operate in this\nSo this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line\nOnce they do that that's when the item gets ...\nYou're in a notice on the screen\nProvided the item that should not be items\nAnd then one idiot how many they need to\nPick the back massager a second worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from the shelf and then puts it on the yellow track\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt\nSet an accepted the processes that we're going to go to tactics\nPack station it's what it sounds like basically the back massager comes in on the yellow trait and the worker packed into a box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ...\nSo what do you have\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone ordered\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it\nX. around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nAssuming label is created and gently place to err on top of the\nSound of air that is placing it on this hard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n\n... so the robots Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like earplugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says he figures are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making were quotas and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nOn responded that they didn't recognize these allegations that's accurate they also said they coach people who are making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm an Amazon I ask learn about this\nWe don't have and power over light individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members\nIt's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers have to have a problem than work with a union to voice concern\n[noise] [noise] so without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nThe warehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall of photos of workers protesting on the other side\nCenter is one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse workers they trained people on things like wage theft and how to file for workers' comp for injuries\nAt the warehouse center of the day I visit is Duane Wilson he's twenty five and he drove forklifts for local warehouses\nAlike working in a way as ... you know your muscles as a child going into\nJoins been working in warehouses for the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helped out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency\nAnd the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want them sometimes they do last week the only woman on the so\nDwayne sometimes lines up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still gets turned away sometimes you only work one full week a month\nOh he says not tomorrow say can I at least worth friday like can you give me anyway he says that this mothers' and I just see if I had enough innings little Thursday new taxes I worked in a while you know but that is a constant threat of that basically yeah\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel green says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for a full time job at the warehouse that he works at\nBasically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper temp agencies provide a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them they take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know\nAnd a lot of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up because they don't want to risk sacrificing the hours they do have\n... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer but that's not his plan right now\nThe kind of ... going to school who would look things up is do\nI Wish I didn't complain about ... so ... any more [noise]\nEmbarking all sectors is one of the fastest growing industries in the economy [noise]\nThat\nI was asking myself that question of whether I Want it to tell my story or not and in that moment I just went with it and they said you know I I was five\nWas Fifteen and I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do with that information they never did anything so then I just understood the lesson that\nWe are not believed and these boy he understood the lesson that\nBoys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\nI'm Sorry we actually listen to survivors and it was a very painful moment\nI cried after because I realized oh my God maybe my father will hear it these way maybe my my hearing these way [noise]\nAnd then it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that\nInteraction with flake and they said you might hear something in the news I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and they said to him it was not your fault that it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed\nI didn't tell my story because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women I I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how do those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are\nI Can't separate me being a woman from being let the now from being an immigrant from being a mother and now accepting and embracing\nThese other part of my identity as a survivor I think the the history of these countries the history of the struggle for inclusion\nOf more of us and the promise of freedom\nWill say it is your most overt political act in some deeply human ways it's the
