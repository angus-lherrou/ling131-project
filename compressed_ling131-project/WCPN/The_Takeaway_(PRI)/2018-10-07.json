cabinet of Mr President\nI Will vote chicken for judge Kavanaugh\nAs the final vote tally became clear protestors warm the cap [laughter]\nKelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right so it's pretty clear by the slimmest of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking\nThat she was going to be supporting Kavanaugh and then just a few minutes later Joe Manchin the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cabinet and that brought us to very clearly locked in yes votes\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a ... a few moments where we were chasing around senators or Tim and I were standing in different hallways different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and counting we mentioned in mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes um flake with a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then ... and had lunch\nWith Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and he came out saying that he felt pretty good about things and from there it seems like we're heading in a direction where the fifty one vote for going to quickly come into place\nTim friday was a really tense day on Capitol Hill it's been a really tense week on Capitol Hill scenes Jeff Flake negotiated this away this one we\nThe way in which the FBI would we open an investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's background there's been a lot of questions about who could eventually get to a yes on Brett Kavanaugh we we found the answer on friday but the fact is that there's been a lot of uncertainty and a lot\nI'm democratic senator and a former representative you've been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida ... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt said the race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson is facing an end Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nThat you know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign huh in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can be as far as I actually had met her before\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump he told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning that his government for the election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she is editor in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane ...\nHe shows me he's working from ... to his show me what you do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote use in Florida yet still up\nYou know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOh she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria\nAnd after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times so this is a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate is your plan out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station he was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\nOne of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country\nThat's really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that but other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican\nOperative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or he's led and the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy and the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and\nIt was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOne of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country right the minute come out to narrow

NPR\nWe're here with a special broadcast through the mid term elections in so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans and suddenly talking about a backlash to own the blood\nDrenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWe're finding now that the the viewer a white male it's okay to be against white guys out\nThis storm is over I didn't get paid for the men and I said that all show male voters are suddenly\nEnergize because I think it could easily as well turn out to me the era of the man who feel like a target as on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person who was never meant citizen I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my mom I don't know what to do mom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey how's it going so they ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very credible with this well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point up tech enthusiasm\nAmong Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election it was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that's eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me in\nFor in the mid term yeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow there were more likely to vote for Republicans than for a Democrat just in the past week yes it is just in the past week and that is absolutely has everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're\nSo much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and there was a big surge in campaign donations\nBut there was something else happening two men were angry\nTam we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days you just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nNo not only is it not a new thing from President Trump it's not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on some of this grievance and and some of this\nFear among people are particularly among white Republican men that the culture has shifted beneath them that you know that\nThey're being left behind that they're being left behind so President Trump and his campaign talked about the forgotten man he talked a lot about political correctness run amok and uh I was talking to Frank Luntz who's Republican pollster um and he was saying that President Trump tapped into something that\nHad been bubbling up along with the societal changes that have been going on for more than a generation\nDetrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed in to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran good to be with you it's got some of the things we're gonna talk about would have been big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett\nSo let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an authorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money to run that agency\nThe width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum how race is giving you a bigger seats Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also uh to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with that that that got done to this week\nThe main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... are there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nI'd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction of Fenton would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller okay\nShifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats\nWho wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married that's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is\nLegal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them passengers and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected so the state department says this is about\nThis is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but in fewer than ten percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country without\nSame sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nAround That's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics shell from NPR Nike Ron thank you so [noise]\n\nAnd as I said this is the politics you from NPR we're going to take a quick break and be right back\nIn the shadow of a
