I'm going up you know when they ... because we need some clear bombing whether\nThe bastards I've never been bombed like they're going to be bombed us time but you got to have the ... is\nThe weather is still bad at all what isn't all that bad goddamn Airforce won't fly for certain Martha ... I mean there's\nLike won't fly or the navy pilots is older better but there\nOh and there are a lot of brave guys John you've got to say I made these POW's these poor guys who got shot down there over there ... not die on rice I'm sure it comes to my uh [noise]\nQuite good thank you\nAre too damn Celtic or after what about the New York times situation while I was you know we're waiting for the judge's decision in New York on our request to stop the times from publishing further excerpts from the Vietnam papers\nThat works we're going to start looking at criminal acts and we got to stop the goddamn leap Christ's sake such crazy double I don't give a damn about stopping the Vietnam papers that all happened under the Democrats might even be a plus you know\nBut it makes my blood boil to have the goddamn newspapers print things stolen government and I found out raised we've got to ferret out those leakers to they are the lowest burden\nLatch got this guy who leaked the Pentagon material and turn around and said look to freeze out the times completely hope areas now around we were just talking about you Mr President I thought she'd like to know the judge gr find slapped a restraining order I'm In New York times this afternoon barring them from printing any more of the Vietnam papers\nPending good for him I told you that judge was a good man right now we can move I'll start right now to get a grand jury convened to seek criminal indictments against the time under round\nThe New York times is finished and the White House and\nNo one but mayor new wave and talk to those bastards do I make myself clear absolutely Mr President if those guys are making five well take our gloves off to we're going to go after the whole crowd wonderful wonderful\nWhen the court stopped the New York times from printing Ben Bradlee was determined to track down a copy of the papers and sees the story for the post technically the post wasn't covered by the court's injunction but of course they knew the government would be asked to him guns blazing\nThat's ridiculous I mean the Washington Post has no intention of publishing troop movements and anything that we regard as sensitive material\nBut how do you know ban you you rush into print was something on the face of it looks innocent enough but what if as a result some agent or operative in Vietnam gets executed\nThe cost of lives and the families of fifty thousand Americans killed in that bamboo or not that much of the Vietnamese may\nEven want to know why it wasn't done earlier\nWell said sir but I'd hate to have to prove it in a court of law microbe are better at an anti war demonstrations\n... wait a second Brian I resent the suggestion that were staging some kind of street corner demonstration here\nThe three men in that room between them have Seventy years of distinguished coverage in their field John Roberts is senior Washington corresponded with those newspapers retiring in two weeks after thirty eight years of government report and George Wilson is the most\nTrusted Defense Department expert in the business for a martyr knows more about the state department that my God damn secretary of state I'm not questioning anybody's credentialed higher questioning their judgment were big boys Bryan on a\nBunch of kids playing newspaper we make these kinds of decisions everyday gentleman's look\nI Hope we can avoid getting into personalities we are all on the same side in this situation\nMy job is to lay out the legal options now the government went into court and said that continuing publication of the Pentagon papers by the New York times would do irreparable damage to the security of the United states the court accepted that argument at least to the extent that it ordered the times to see the publishing till the facts can be determined in a formal hearing\nThe presumption it seems to me is that the court intends the issue be aired in the court room not in the press that the Washington Post goes ahead and publish this isn't in effect floating the court's injunction Ryan as a hell of a good argument was published and find out [noise]\n... you know I Confess that I have trouble following the logic that suggests that because the government declared something off limits on newspapers she just fall in line like a bunch of Marines and that's one hell of a precedent\nBesides the way our first story is lining up the events were writing about all took place in the fifties nothing sensitive about that oh come on if it's not sensitive twice a U.S government chosen to keep it secret for Twenty years\nSecret including the menu at the Pentagon cafeteria\nAnd then it leaks it selectively as it served its purpose without leaks both the government and the press might as well closed up shop it's an intimate symbiotic relationship\nBrian relayed a personal experience huh\nThat covered Jack Kennedy in the sixties you remember is a big summit with Khrushchev sure well it was a disaster and as a result the administration labeled everything connected with the dialogue top secret off limits but Jack\nJack was interested in getting out the fact the cruise ship had agreed to relax some uh orange restrictions on neutral arms inspections with a victory a store so he arranged for me to get a hold of that part of the file and I'm going to school for me propaganda coup\nFor him then that was a totally different situation that was the president exercising his right to declassify a document or it doesn't matter whether it's the president or the director of federal fisheries at the point is that this cozy arrangement between the press and the government in Washington is going on for a long long time most of it produces problem\nBut once in a while a journalist manages to ferret out something really meaningful jury might embarrass a federal official or or an entire administration but we have a right to suppress it or to give the government that power who's talking about suppression I'm not arguing against publication I'm arguing against rushing into publication what is the rush\nWell I'll tell you what the Russia's Brian for three days of time debating alone but gee the vat of I'm going to be God damned if I'm gonna let that story slip away now in short a scoop at any cost know calculate the costs of best you can then go for the school [noise]\nListen to this I found an incredible passage about dams assassination seems the Kennedy administration was involved in in Nineteen sixty three cool all the way up to its eyeballs and he talking about I thought the idea and so he did the ... some of the other top people\nQuote rightly or wrongly we back them for a long hard years seems in Congress now to get him down kick him around and get rid of him ... that telegram on October thirtieth Nineteen sixty three\nThursday they before the coup right\nOnly listen to this it seems that our ambassador and probably the rest of the administration were helping the plotters foot here's here's a telegram summit George Sunday in the White House to ambassador lodge\nOnce a coup under responsible leadership is big gun Bundy says it is in the interest of the U.S government that it should succeed so Jack Kennedy actually helped overthrow T. M. seem to be sure as hell didn't stop it [noise]\nThreats allergy flight\nThe usual eastern shuttle luxury brand you know friends maybe accords the chairman of the post company Bryant so who's the kid out in the step selling lemonade at ten cents a shot\nOh that's my nine year old capitalist marina oh great great well at the post get shut down the Bradley family can always switched to the soft drink business man out of her prices I told the charge twenty five cents a glass but that she's already a bleeding heart liberals [laughter] ban\nChow has a start great salad say well it's early stuff but I think it's interesting it shows that we were tampering with their politics as far back as the fifties and certainly start with some of them or turn on a fairly the sets up the entire series don't worry no worry it'll bill okay okay okay trying it out you know it's after three o'clock\nI'll get back to it then there's another issue to consider here espionage why look\nIf the court let's just go ahead and print the government can still bring criminal charges against the post under the federal Espionage Act which says what it's a part of the criminal code section seven nine three eat they're just let me read it to\nWhoever has unauthorized possession of information relating to the national defense which information that possess or has reason to believe could be used to injure\nTen thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or\nBoth no problem okay well in the post has no reason to believe in as harmful information to if we did and it was really harmful but we wouldn't break them up\nAnd the truth is you don't know what you've gotten your skip point three unauthorized possession the news accounts say the papers were stolen that's a consideration here to\nWeigh it never reveal your sources that's an old newspaper traditional\nI Know that that naive I'm not but I'm convinced the government can make a substantial criminal case against you if something damaging slips into the newspaper they've already way of the espionage like in the New York times who goes to jail maybe you for starters\nRowdy a vast espionage and every type of visual and this administration ... editor in the country will be there with me for the voting this kinda stuff all the time and why don't you fellas going in my kitchen there's some sandwiches and their let me talk to Fritz for a few minutes is a good idea I haven't had anything to eat for two days [noise]\nYeah you're not really taking seriously argue\nWell at the right that I'm paying this guy or at least going to listen to what he has to say\nThat it's in he has no idea how the system works yeah he's not the key he's not the key baby is\nSo let me talk to him okay [noise] uh about a drink ... death lemonade and scotch my favorite drink [laughter]\nYou know afraid so we really need this one with Catherine made the editors paper or told her that it could go to waive towards greatness towards mediocrity and I have no intention of presiding over the last man\nYou know that my blood has more in in the Senate has profit and loss ledger is just the thought of a story like this makes me to light headed but I'm also a businessman and when I look through the lens of the chairman of the board of the post company I get damned nervous uh what about the survival and economic health of this company you'd\nLook what's on the table if we end up facing criminal charges the post stock when public only two days ago we got a million three hundred thousand shares outstanding or deal doesn't form up until the end of this\nThe event in my mind a criminal indictment for violating espionage laws\nThat adds up to a catastrophic event is going to be any criminal indictment Fritz yeah I've been around this down for Thirty years and no president's everybody dumb enough to take on the press in that manner I mean sure Nixon hate our guts he loved to stick to it but he doesn't have the calls that go the criminal route that what\nMakes you think he doesn't have something there are such things as real secrets after all hey we almost lost the battle of midway when the Chicago Tribune printed the fact the U.S a crack the Japanese codes\nYeah remember I was in the navy thank God the Japanese didn't read the Chicago Tribune\nWhile you're gonna be damn sure that Hanoi as reading the Washington Post\nAnyway all mixed needs is an indictment don't forget we've also got TV and radio licenses we get involved in a felony case the FCC will pull those licenses faster than you can pronounce the call letters what we're talking about here is a hundred and Ninety three million dollar corporation on the line\nOr that's quite a scenario phrase and if I didn't know you better I'd have to call that cheap job or you know that I have to listen to this not only as a newspaper man but also as a member of the board of that company and don't get paranoid hump dealing with you straight it's not my style to play games\nI'm here to protect Kay Graham and our newspaper yeah I Know for it so I Know that and I respect your friend your her lawyer biggest shoulder\nBeen I'm sure French Bebe can tell you better than either there's a lot more than reputation at stake\nHere and I'll tell you that post cave ins that you're ...\nYou're going to lose somebody gets opera partners maybe an editor at\nJust who you're talking about talking about child child just threaten the public fine if we do not print some are oh oh my God then it can be serious I'm afraid it is you know we all feel that the post ... information about what really happened in Vietnam which our government tried to suppress not find a real threat from that government we back away\nWe might as well because I'm a shopping mall gave away\nAll right All right I I've I've got your arguments let me talk to Fritz alone please\nWhat's happening in a different All right All right Kate ... you're you're aware of the stock issues of course the FCC licenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] LA theater works production top secret the battle for the Pentagon papers by Jeffrey town\nOr story continues in power

two thousand ten at the New York theater workshop\nOver the years Eli theatre work has invited top journalist and leading political figures to take part in panel discussions after the performances to give us their perspective on this landmark First Amendment case\nWe're now going to listen to these experts key insights along with some archived recordings of Nixon's phone conversations with his advisors\nTo begin with John Dean the White House counsel to President Nixon from Nineteen Seventy two Nineteen Seventy three who describes Nixon's reaction when the Pentagon papers story first broke\nWhen Nixon came in the office on Sunday he first look to see what the coverage has been and the New York times had the post there also but he would look to the first of the times\nI just see how the coverage of the wedding had been which was pretty good he was pretty happy with that and it looked over sauce on this major story or the first installment of this study of the ah causes the war in Vietnam which causes attach in his first reaction\nOr is that this is wonderful this is going to show how duplicitous the Democrats have been and how they have dragged us into this war by deceiving the American people and this is his initial thought and his initial frame of mind it's really not until Monday when Henry Kissinger comes back\nAs you portrayed briefly in the play Henry turns the president talks about\nThe effect this is going to have by the inability of him to control the papers of his administration highly confidential material it'll affect first of all his negotiations\nWith the north Vietnamese in Paris and the secret Paris Peace talks but more importantly Henry is escalating when he tells him it's going to affect your ability to carry out your China initiative\nWhich then was still in development and was the centerpiece not only of what he conceived of as his reelection campaign but his entire presidency he knew his decision and his China initiative would really change history and change his place in history\nHere is a recording ... on ... talking with the security advisor Alexander Hank\nHopefully [noise] hello Hi out how what about the cash you got to figure you know so I think it's totally quite low uh [noise] what is the glass Laker better because I Would think yeah and also that's\nWe classified documents of the war that I see that I didn't read the story but uh you mean that was leaked out of the Pentagon\nIs there a whole study that was done for lack of marriage and they carried on after McNamara left by covered and the effects over there\nIs a devastating a security breach of\nThe greatest magnitude amazing I\nSay about what what's being done about it I mean I didn't I think we know what if it's coming up\nNo we did not sure uh but it's it's something that is a mixed\nBag it says the attack on Kennedy shows that the genesis of the war are really occurred the sixty one hand or a route along President Johnson

I just start right at the top and fire some people [noise]\nTo report did come from the defense department specifically I'm Daniel Ellsberg who worked on the top secret study here now stuck with ... she's deliberations for leaking classified documents\nHigh was confident uh and so it prove that they would never be able to convince the judge or a jury that a single line of that in fact climbed national security to be young\nNow that's never been a nobody has ever really drawn the implications for that about the nature of our secrecy system and what a contains because that was not a random selection if it were enough you know seven thousand pages and none of them should have been classified at all\nNeeds to be gal is president emeritus of the council on Foreign Relations he directed the project and\nOurselves about how eventually they should become public I did not want them to become public and the way they did I felt that coming out the way they did would tell basically a wrong story or mislead people about what the right story was\nThat coming out the way they did the history of our involvement in Vietnam what would be more about our government lying and cheating that about what our foreign policy community and political community believed\nAnd the truth of the matter was that the main reason we got into Vietnam was not because our government lied to us or continue to lie to us Dan and I knew that\nAnd then worked in the Pentagon before I came to the Pentagon worked out in Vietnam we all knew what to drill was", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018",
