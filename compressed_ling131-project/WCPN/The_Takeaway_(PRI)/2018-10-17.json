of the Gulf of Mexico is yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientists with the inner governmental panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael with only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty fifty in Paris climate agreement called for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees would be beneficial but this new report finds that have to agree different poses huge risks keeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade\nProfessor Oppenheimer it's been a lead author for high PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael glad to be here again let me cut to the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see I Do get scared about\nThis issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message upon reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here they are projected to worsen over time and the point at which\nThe risks are related to climate change that is that the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not\nToward the end of this century but very close a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nReport has an unusual origin the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change produces sorrow assessments of all our knowledge on climate change\nEvery six years or so and then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports then I'm working on the next ... report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets\nThe report that just came out is on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we\nSingle very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest I PCC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach the net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report they frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has has put on it\nIs sort of like twelve years we don't do it we should do the world comes to win and that's not the case the reality is at every step you do the best you can if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end costs that is\nThe risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually that doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands states\nBut it'll make life just miserable expensive and uncomfortable for the rest\nOf us so what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of limiting warming to a degree and a half century\nTo what most people think ah the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but\nThe real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organized to actually reinvent them\nFor me to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what in fact do we need to do than as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nAt the most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means\nGetting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible reducing and eventually eliminating our dependence on\nPetroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and probably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon\nDioxide already in the atmosphere that even if we slow down markedly or ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards the ... century\nIt seems we're going to need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we live very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of scientists were skeptical that there would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half in two degrees but because the government's call for the ...\nAnd a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that they were big differences between one and a half two degrees let me give you an example already by one and a half degrees there are places are particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the benchmark hundred year\nStorm or a hundred year flood event I should call it\nIncreases markedly even by one and a half degrees so that you're getting at that level what is today a wandering a hundred year event becomes a yearly event think about that we don't deal with those kinds of events effectively now even though they're very rare what happens when they're happening all the time\nWhat's missing from this report and and tell me why there really isn't\nMuch of a social and political analysis there isn't much discussion of the political and social obstacles there is discussion of the need for transformation but not that much discussion of how you go about it\nIn particular places and why it's difficult to do and the reasons for that our number one it's different in every place in the eye PCC can't do a special report for every place on earth\nAnd number two many political leaders have regarded this as an unpopular thing to do and they don't want to start digging into some of these very basic political reasons so IPC see did the best

O R G\nI began the second part of our talk by asking Secretary Kerry they consider the issue of stranded assets as it applies\nTo climate change let me ask you just to think reflect on this for a moment looking at American history in Eighteen sixty\nIn the south there was more monetary value in slaves than there was in the land by Eighteen fifty five that was a classic stranded asset all that value disappeared\nTo what extent today do you think we're being held hostage by folks who think that all that fossil fuel and the ground which is on balance sheets at billions and billions and billions of dollars\nAnd it can't all be burned if we understand the science correctly to what extent are we headed down a path\nThe economic question to solve that problem we wound up in a pretty in a very bloody war yeah I don't I mean I don't think that's the choice for for America now I think that I think uh most of the executives I Know at the higher level of the oil industry or all diversifying\nA Shelby pay their all investing in New energy they're ready to move where the market we'd go and uh\nI mean we're not going to be able to transition fast enough that you suddenly dry up and not have oil or gas and ... there's going to be on the gas for a while it's just the nature of the beast we've got to try to guarantee it's not for two alone\nWhy I'm simply listening to the scientists I mean I'm listening to the end and understanding the science if we don't move off fossil fuels fast enough\nWe could reach what's called a tipping point where things begin to cascade down words in a spiral of destruction and dying of dying sees dying trees dying species of various kinds because it's not sustainable and if you get into that\nKind of a spiral nobody knows nobody can tell you how you break out of it I'm just applying the precautionary principle of the idea of governing\nMean we buy insurance to make sure our of our home burned down we're going to be able to rebuild it we by car insurance to fix the rack and ... you know life insurance and then somebody lost the life\nThe family's okay why are we buy insurance against the death and destruction that will come with increased storms and increase climate change\nIt's beyond my understanding why are we going to have a president who is a desire of this science Ninety eight percent of all the scientists in the world who ever watch this and looked at it with peer reviewed studies peer reviewed studies all say this is happening happening\nOh to sending them we're entering into the sort of suicide packed it could be worse than the United states civil war that right now we are heading I you know the goal in Paris was to keep the rise of\nThe earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade and we were going to try to excite enough nations to become involved that we could meet that standard we now know at the current rate we're not meeting that standard we\nAre heading now towards four degrees centigrade rise in the temperature of the average temperature of the planet that's catastrophic\nYou'll have water battles you will have refugees moving you think we have tough migration challenges today where people can't produce food and various parts of the world will their water dries up and they're not able to live what happens when the oceans change and you have a migration away from certain stocks that people have relied on for food and so forth [noise]\nThey're just so many unknowns here I'm not willing to just throw up my hands and sail someone's going to take care of this\nBecause that's just not responsible given the input\nBack in the day as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts which is not exactly ordinarily a very exciting position you made your mark jumping on the acid rain ... tell me what did that teach you about the politics of environmental protection that\nPeople with a reasonable purpose in public life\nAre able to work together Republican and Democrat in order to do things that are good for American citizens I was a lieutenant governor but Michael Dukakis are allowed me to be the chair of the governors task force for him I worked with Governor John Sununu in New Hampshire I worked with Governor addicts Celeste of Ohio\nAnd we put together the three of us a an approach\nDrawn up by the way by the American Enterprise Institute is conservative approach to how you use the market to be able to accomplish something you want to accomplish\nRained under control through the system and then when I was in the Senate I was able to use that and put it into the clean Air Act\nAnd so it became part of the national program so you don't hear about it I said right now we could do the same thing for climate change if we had the leadership that was willing to recognize the greatest market the biggest market on this planet is the energy market it is today\nThey're four to five billion users they're going to be about nine billion users next Thirty years 'cause that's going to be a population of the of the world and we have the ability through the deployment of sustainable renewable alternative energy to be able to limit our emissions and control climate\nYou write
