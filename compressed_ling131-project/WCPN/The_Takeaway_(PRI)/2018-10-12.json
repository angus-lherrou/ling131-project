C. and the raskin family fund was additional funding from Robert Conrad Cleveland State university the Chautauqua Institution the Cleveland Clinic and the United black fond of greater Cleveland incorporated\n[noise]\n[noise]\nGood afternoon and welcome to the city of Cleveland um rejecting senior Rosen producer writer's dream and I need to clear my throat [noise] excuse me the beer to moderate our conversation about the only statewide issue on the ballot this November which is issue one to reduce penalties war crimes of obtaining possessing and using illegal drugs\nIf she wanted to propose constitutional amendment that would change sentencing guidelines where some drug crimes that affect other aspects of those crimes\nProponents would argue that among other things the measure would direct nonviolent drug offenders to treatment rather than to prison and reduce the number of those incarcerated reducing present operating costs opponents believe the measure would make Ohio one of the most lenient drug crime laws in the nation\nOur parents today Steven Johnson broke deputy director for policy at the Ohio justice in Policy Center\nAnd the honorable David C ... the Cuyahoga County commonplace court have strong points of view on this potential legislation and it's in ... Ohio voters\nWorried about our format today we are not having a formal time debate we're having a conversation advocates meat side of the issue and we all ask you to be patient you'll have a chance to ask questions and the second half of our program with that with gifts or whether you're opening statements from each side judgments I Will go first\nGood afternoon thank you Rick it's pleasure to be\nJudges in Ohio do I've been a drug court judge for ten of my Twenty years on the bench and eleven hundred people have been through ... courts drug court system\nBut I Am against issue one and here's why issue one will destroy my successor will some of these drug court and all of the other comment please drug courts operate in the state of Ohio where lives are saved on a daily basis issue one we'll let violent offenders and many sex offenders out of prison early\nIssue one most importantly takes away the tools of accountability that judges like myself views on a daily basis to hold people accountable for their actions\nIssue one decriminalize is high levels of dangerous drugs and in fact in some cases legalize this trafficking issue one is based on the false narrative that the prisons are full of low level non violent offenders\nIssue one will have no savings or very little saving the cost including the issue one will be borne by the taxpayers and will be taken from other portions of the general fund\nEvery newspaper who was consider this issue in Ohio has opposed issue one joined the Columbus dispatch the Cleveland Plain dealer ... register the Toledo Blade and uh the Warren ... tribute\nIssue one is opposed or I Am posing because it locks in concrete these constitutional changes it will nearly be impossible to an act corrective legislation which is almost always necessary to take care of the unforeseen consequences\nAnd lastly people will die official one passes people will die he will not have access to the treatment provided in comic police drug courts and in our criminal justice system as a whole the neighborhood safety drug treatment in ...\nAnd thank you again to the Cleveland stuff for hosting this really important things vague about why\nYes vote on issue one is going to create so much safety for us in the state and a save resources and produce a lot of healing\nIssue one was created by Ohioans for Ohio once it was created by people are who are hungry for a different way uh from listening to judgment twice a day and the previous things he's written and said and his amazing history with a drug court I Know how much we agree on\nWe agree that a drug addiction is a chronic brain disease we agree that we're in the midst of a ... and everybody here I think of Greece I mean how many people here\nIf you're willing would raise your hand say you've been touched by the opioid epidemic you we all know so there's no debate that's not a debate today is that we're in the midst of a hurricane\nThat we are being flooded by this the current addiction crisis of course the opioid epidemic but really the long standing addiction crisis interest drugs generally we know that is true and we both agree I think that the revolving door prison is working\nUh we also think I think that it's smarter to treat the underlying cause of drug addiction rather than just treating the symptoms of criminal behavior yes drug addiction is a crime driving disease I mean I feel I feel like we've I've heard you say those kinds of things\nAnd yet the difference here the difference is how are we going to get better\nIf you look if you can imagine with me three charts prison population prison budget and the opioid deaths they just go up if we keep doing what we're doing we're going to get more of the same of what we've always gotten\nWhat issue one offers is to use the voter a chance to take the power that you have always had issue article one issue stay a section one of the constitution all political power is inherent in the people the constitution does\nAnd the politicians that have structure of the current system have not getting given us we'll probably get into the details issue one's written carefully to produce more safety and a better outcomes\nThank you both for those were listening on the radio and respond to his question about opioids roughly twenty percent of the room did raise their hand I'll start with you Mr Johnson grove your previously had success in seeing legislation passed why go through the constitution on this one\nYeah and with many people in this room in fact uh allies and colleagues here\nWe've seen lots of legislation ...\nClean justice last sessions current session a to expand opportunities for people with criminal records opening job opportunities removing barriers\nLots of appetite bipartisan it seems in the legislature to get that done what I've also been part of over my entire career here here in Ohio is watching the legislature do two things one water down any attempt to safely reduce the prison population you could go back in Ninety six of truth in sentencing or justice reinvestment act\nOr or the ... program or other constitutional modernization commission or the retaliation committing all of which produced buck is if you took about talk about results\nAnd instead what we've watched is that the legislature passed ten percent of the building introduced every year our new crimes and more penalties so they only go one direction when it comes to stopping the flood of people coming in the system there's definitely a positive great change on the back and re entry like we talked about from towards employment and others\nBut they have no appetite for reducing the flood of people coming in that prison system and that's where I think that people will hire are done because there's a link between the waste of resources and people going into that system and where we could put that instead into drug treatment in the community\nA judge before we get into the merits or lack there of issue one itself wisely constitution not the place to make this change\nOr its allies I said to my office\nThere's a we will all realize a the folly of our ways and there won't be a way to change it there will be people who put cigarettes out on children who will be able to reduce their sentence by twenty five percent for merely working in the prison ... kitchen\nUm we can't we can't do that I Do want to address you know my opponents last statement about the legislatures done nothing now the last for general assemblies have taken steps or I Want the public to understand that right now because of the cat\nUh if I have a nonviolent fourth or fifth the grief Ellen in front of me with no history of violence\nMe or any other judge unstable have cannot send that person to person at sentencing or that is new in the last year and a half so the general assembly has taken steps the prison population is twenty nine thousand five hundred twelve we both agree that's really Hi this is that\nWhat kind of backwards here demonstrative evidence veil okay [laughter] so this is the prison population on the prison population\nThis is the number of people serving life sentences they're never going to get out\nThis is the number is ... it was seven thousand but there are Fifteen thousand and thirty three people serving sentences for first degree felony is the most severe penalties\nThere are eleven thousand six hundred and eighty six people serving time for a second degree felonies there are another nine thousand nearly ten thousand serving time for surgery felonies and this number five thousand six hundred and Fifteen is\nTo combine that number of low level fourth and fifth degree felony serving time\nYou don't have to change anything I'm worried about the people that are driving in because there are a hundred and eighty five probation departments in the state there are some that are flooding our prison system with low level non violent not even crimes probation violations and that's why we want accountability for people to misbehave it just doesn't ...\nLike I said it bars it does it there are other ways to build change behavior improved community safety get people into treatment that doesn't have to be the threat of a hammer incarceration\nThree weeks ago the Supreme Court justice Marino corner was a guest on my program we talk for at length about this topic one of the points she most wanted to stress to voters that this proposed amendment would allow an individual carrying enough to know to kill ten thousand people to escape felony drug charges\nJudge how much of the inclusion of fencing oh in this program\nOr a lock for opposing forces\nThere's there's fat and all that said extreme example but yeah it let's just say that now there is in effect and all that you can carry around the kill a school bus full of children and all the first responders\nHave responded to help save them um whether it's ten thousand individuals or you know fifty or the amount of fat and all that would be a misdemeanor under this is just too high you could have forty nine terrorists full of heroin on your person\nAnd that would be a misdemeanor now that's what I meant by this legitimize this trafficking\nUh it's just not right and I and you want to point out that Mr Johnson grilled did contradict himself he remembers opening statement he talked about this climbing graph of prison population and opiate use and then he just admitted a couple ... moments ago said the prison population has been steady in Ohio over the last ten years\nSo you know let's be truthful or with our audience here so\nEvidence based practices are great on paper but again it's a one size fits all system and I want to explain you why we have them in ... county and they don't work and drug court because they're not they're not specific to a dependent offenders\nUm they don't include things for treatment\nYou can't have a one size fits all uh programs\nOne specific instance in the proposed measure well to be clear I mean the ... I'm Glad that the judge acknowledged the extremity of what both the Columbus dispatch and politifact have called ally is that\nAh that somehow people are going to carrying around these large quantities of national drug trafficking is going to run amok Ohio absolutely not true issue one does not touch trafficking\nAnd those Nineteen point nine grams or what have you uh ... it's been talked about his charges trafficking every day of the week in every court in the states\nThat have talked to a federal prosecutor and we don't touch federal law at all can't don't you know not at all\nThere they just finished up a truck drug testing case for to ramp central that's how sentinels being handled and we don't stop at all not the Senate bill one which just passed and is going to go in effect on Halloween of this year changes fentanyl trafficking lost all that will be in a place and if the legislature wants to change for trafficking please go ahead\nOr in fact they can change the definition of trafficking should they need to if there's any concern any concern\nThat somehow people trapped in ... it's not easy to enough to prove under current law in fact Ohio is one of one of two states in the country that don't have a possession within tend to deliver\nWhich is a slightly easier than our current tracking statue so we can go that way there's all kinds of things that can be done to handle the large quantities of ... kind of all human beings are thrown out there those are it's it's a really nice to be set aside\nThe issue here is are we going to help the people that are addicted who right now the habit is put them in prison we've got to break that habit we've got to get people out of that\nSystem and get the resources out of that system and back into the place where the community can get the healing it'd nice how are you going to help the people who are addicted if you take away sixty three percent of the people that are having my drug court will I have I have\nYou know from January of two thousand Seventeen to the president we admitted a hundred and fifty nine people on line to dock it's a hundred of them were there for your fourth and fifth repossession charters\nAll those people being miserable court\nYou think issue on their own run out afterwards and started drug court no they're funded by their local municipalities their a local taxpayers fund me any courts are those people that now face misdemeanors enter issue on they're not even get arrested\nThe police chief the mayors of those towns I predict will just say hey we can't afford to treat them just you know take their stuff and go and those people are the ones who are going to die\nBecause you want to respond yeah please so I mean there are the vast majority of drug court in the state or currently in the comic lead level like judgment ties there are twenty nine there at the municipal level\nThat's because right now we choose to label people with low level drug possession felons and give them the lifelong labor of job barriers and housing berries that they get with that and we have to hold the threat of prison over their head for some reason in order to drive them into feeling\nWe could do it at the municipal level it's already in the under twenty nine places we can do more this requires ships in the system and this is the option for you the people of Ohio to choose do we want to require shifts in the system so that we can get more healing for people or do we want to just acquiesce to the system it's too hard for us to change\nI'm OK demanding that the system change so that we get better results for people that's what this issue was about\nHad a lot of people in this room and raise their hands of their lives were touched by dependency ask yourself how many of your loved ones who are touched by dependency are lining up at ... banging on the door to get at people don't go to treatment on their own\nUh everybody has an Uncle Billy who drank too much you know their interventions you have to force him in and the criminal justice system and arrest as a lotta times somebody's bottom\nJust to bring the street just point home Orlando hall I spoke with at rotary hall they get about thirty to forty walk into month commander ...\nTalk to the individual about getting help they'll take 'em to detox of the Thirteen hundred non sales they went to sixty went to detox\nThirty to forty five ... hall Lisa fair at the centers also known for a million dollars free clinic the needle exchange programs\nThirty to forty people walking in the ... they're passing out fifty to sixty thousand meals a month and the needle exchange program people don't volunteer to get help their brains are so hijacked by the disease\nTo think that just sprinkling some more treatment dollars out there is going to solve this crisis it's just not even ...\nEvery time right now to get into drug treatment mistake is sixty days where\nYou're getting that statistic though from the department of mental health at Santa and from a department of health and it did under fifty\nEmbezzled but cats on Broadway you can remember it easily kind of humidity assessment treatment services right now\nI mean I I've I talk to lots of people in St Louis guy at at one of our signature gathering events uh Bush that drove across the states trying to find a bed and could not find a bed for his daughter\nThere are a deep need for treatment before and without the hammer of the criminal justice system that's what we're trying to fill\nAnd the other thing that's really hard to admit I mean this truly like I I Know the judgment tire that a judge ... who I talked to in Youngstown other drug court the best drug for judges in the state really wants to save lives and aren't doing their absolute best with the tools they have\nWhich is very difficult to admit is that when we put people in jail for some time short since the research says and there are seven published studies say this that when people are released from jail after the short since they're eight to ten times more likely to die of an overdose\nSo yes it feels like we're saving their live in the moment but that choice of incarceration well meaning though it may be is a death sentence and we're trying to ...\nYou both question on air from both of you on the computers will go go to you first judge is there a fundamental problem with not Ohioans George Soros Mark Zuckerberg Nicholas Brits gr pumping more than four million dollars into this race should we be suspicious of there in the game for a judge\nIt is a peculiar that uh to people from far away I chose to make Ohio their little social experiment I'm I'm surprised they didn't hear about the eleven other states that have\nDone some kind of modification or the drug laws every one of those other states did it legislatively and not in the constitution not in some on changeable manner um\nThe ... foundation has a put a what a million a million and a half and and that's if you like the two thousand sixteen election that Facebook helped contribute to you're going to love as you want\nSo uh just to know like with people in this room I've spent more time in church basements then I can count a and I've done that over the last ten years of my career here in Ohio building this campaign\nOkay we got was especially the last two years Dr drafting collaborating with people who've been affected by the criminal justice system as crime victims as people who've been addicted or had a family member who's a decade or people that have been incarcerated we've worked with policy experts are across the system and vetted our language to various people that are actually active in the justice system we're retired\nYou know by the time somebody gets into the court system you know society has missed is he hasn't gotten his education ah he's been a growing up in a traumatic environment his mental health has gone on treated you know we have to\nIntervene farther upstream so that kid doesn't stick a gun in the face of the lady walking down the street\nAgree more [laughter] we absolutely need to do and that's exactly what we need to get issue one passing put more resources upstream uh your question about the um a constitution or the the reason we're going with the state constitution now the some of the places that have passed something similar\nIs not the ... or less legalization at all both those words were set and clearly far from the truth de facto a so misdemeanors crime and you can go to jail for it and you can go to ... and all kinds of things like that now what the some of those other states have\nBy ballot initiative is a protected piece of legislation so once you pass that piece of legislation as voters you the people get to have that political power that is inherent in you\nYou get to have it protected from the legislature for repealing it the next day not so in Ohio if we did and initiated statute which is possible you know it's the exact same almost the exact same number of signatures when all this money you know get people all around the state was put boards\nAnd then you pass you know you take your vaunted a political power guaranteed to you by article one section one of the constitution and the next day\nThis legislation will repeal it and I know that because we can look at what they've done Nineteen Ninety six to ... two thousand eleven justice reinvestment\nA two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen the recalled vacation committee which produced the row legislation\nThis legislature will not get done what we need to get done in the state they take half measures just look at the thing that was proposed to prosecutors in Franklin County that proposed a a sort of a issue one light and it's super light okay and doesn't even do a quarter of what we're trying to do and there's zero reinvestment in what they're proposing there\nWhat's most significant as how the legislature responded the president of the Senate looked at it was like nah kind of looks interesting maybe it will look at it next session we should put together a committee to study it is that what you want another decade of study committee is that what your people need we need to get people say he's from this addiction crisis and we have\nTo significantly shift years\nThis can't be done by tap it half measures we have to shift gears issue one is a careful thoughtful way to do so and it's an exciting option for you that people will hire to finally get around the hot air of Columbus and actually make this choice yours\nAnd suffered half measure an issue one are you willing to make some compromise to get on the ballot if for some reason it doesn't make it an over\nThis issue one I'm really be surprised but she won't doesn't win in November but um I think it will\nHowever or if it doesn't yeah I'll be open to all kinds of conversations you know I'm just a you know this may or may not land with people and the audience but you know\nAbout what he was talking about Obamacare is like if you've got a way to make it better on there and that is exactly what I'm therefore I'm there for that conversation every day of the week and so are the people in this room that are supportive issue one all around the state\nEfficient one doesn't pass we've got a we we've got lots of people that are hungry for change but only if it's going to produce meaningful results and I haven't seen anything proposed by anybody that even gets close to issue one is going to offer to this day\n... thank you\nGentlemen I appreciate the information very much it will help me decide how to vote or both of you have indicated treatment as an important option an important way to move forward with the addicted person\nAnd I'm not talking about the violent whatever I'm Talking about addicted people in this city I have two people that are very important to me that are addicted to heroin\nThey have both gone to existing a rehab\nCenters one is cats that you mentioned has fifty open seats and all I can say is thank God it does because that's the easiest place in town to get more heroin\nMost of these treatment centers are drawn selling centers so what are either one of you planning to do to manage the quality of these places that you're sending people to rehab\nA because right now they're just great sources for more drugs\nAnd I can tell you what if she wants to do a couple of things number one is the requirement in our men that the uh invest\nOf the substance abuse treatment we're not going to lead now Florida you may have heard a you know is that it didn't agree just example is got like fly by night privatize you know proper tears come in and do drug treatment which are exactly kind of what you're describing you know they just kind of like people come and gaining a clock clock I'm Out I did my drug treatment get my give me my Medicaid bill\nThat's not going to happen in the state because we require a careful oversight by the state\nA department of mental health and addiction services both in the granting and and the follow up afterwards in terms of studying the effectiveness we've got to make sure these investments are done right and after she won passes that's the other thing I'm going to be here for and many other advocates around the state is making sure those investments are done right and in following up with advocacy\nAt the state level and at the local level to make sure the investments go out to things that work\nWell\nNever going to solve this there'll be a crisis in the criminal justice system I'll tell you that ah why do we treat a chronic disease you know dependency as a chronic disease means if left untreated will kill you why do we treated differently than other chronic diseases hypertension or diabetes why do we treated out of mainstream medicine\nThose are the people you need to engage in this conversation I'm the medical profession brought us this problem and they've done very little to help dig out well we can make a buck off of it\nWell now let's do what we did with drunk driving laws we got all the states to a lower their drunk driving alcohol or a to point oh eight percent you know how we did that the federal government said we're not giving you a highway funds unless you're you're alcohol levels that way\nWell the federal government or the center for Medicaid and Medicare services can say you're not getting reimbursed unless you have a certain percentage of bed and your hospital a associated with a dependency your mental health care\nOr we're not going to give you a full reimbursement unless you have a detox unit or you know the talk shows aren't expensive\nSo that could be controlled by the hospital the same way you go to rehab for a hip replacement you know we don't treat this disease in mainstream medicine and we're we need to change that and uh we're just going to be you know tilting at windmills until we do that\nYes\nHi thank you my question is really a point of clarification on which I think most casual voters are going to be talking about with this issue so I've heard radio ads that say if approved\nA rapists will be released into the street early and I think judgment how you may have even alluded to that in your opening statement so\nBut on the city club a description here it says it will\nUm have reductions in sentences for the carts rated vigils except individuals incarcerated for murder rape or child molestation so my question is what is the truth\nWell I didn't say race I said sex offenders so that includes sexual battery that includes chow photographers or that includes people who might have been\nGuilty of rape but pled guilty to something lesser than rape because you know the little girl had a delayed disclosure and didn't have any DNA\nThat's our criminal justice system work so there is no crime in Ohio called ... child molestation I don't understand why my friend put that in the legislation I Know a child molestation is most states needs to Bob Bob bother\nYou know does that mean child endangering or you know that's\nThat's a crime that's exploded it's it's unclear so except for rape murder and the unicorn crime of child molestation everybody's eligible to get out early under issue on and um they want to dress miss an hour I Love ... policy matters work on everything but this\nFor letting prisoners out earlier this\nSo just explain a little bit more about how they earn credit work so uh the maximum current law and Ohio is you can only get eight percent of your sentence off you can only earn in a limited number of people can earn a five days off now I Will say there are forty states in this country that have some kind of earn credit\nOf the forty states that have any kind of do a program a and get some time off we are ... we get the fewest amount of days to the fewest number of people\nThe sky Alabama you can get thirty days off your sentence for just donating blood some states get what's called good time which we used to having all how we do not and are not having now in this issue one good time as you sit on a on the bed and you just don't do anything bad and you get time off your sense we're requiring people to on time off\nNow the cap of twenty five percent only the most active or someone would basically have to take earn credit every single day of their entire prison sentence to get to that twenty five percent not many people are going to get there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)",
