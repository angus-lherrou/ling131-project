reporter trip Gabriel\nTo find out how the recent fires floods in hurricanes have or haven't been playing on the campaign trail [noise] trip gave you a welcome to climate was glad to be with you\nSo as we approach the terms with me uh to lots of hot button social issues how was energy and climate and the environment playing this election cycle\nWill climate change as an issue so described is hardly plane and all that just is a head scratcher to someone like me\nCoast in California it's been a season of century or five hundred year floods in the in the southeast and of course there have been the a widespread attacks on\nClimate policy and energy policy by the administration but it is an issue that ah is not much talked about a certainly in federal races for Congress are you here at more\nAt the state level in um [noise] maybe not surprisingly some of the western states were energy is much more um on voters' minds\nRight there is a carbon tax on the ballot in Washington a gas tax repeal and California fracking initiative in Colorado a clean energy proposals in Arizona and Nevada all western states uh it's but it's not really playing along the east coast or even some of the extraction states in the east\nThere are sort of local issues are interestingly Florida a algae or as toxic algae spread as they become a big issue in the uh the gubernatorial races down there but climate change you know which you know particularly in the wake of the IPC see a report noting\nVery dire consequences or you know speeding up more than scientists had previously are expected it it's very hard to find a a race for a house seat or or United States Senate seat in which it is a front and center issue and and and it perhaps it's not surprising in the sense that\nYou know the big question here is whether Democrats will or take a majority in the house representatives and the districts that are are in play ah mostly Republican held are by definition swing or battleground districts and\nClimate is an issue that has become a enormously polarized along partisan lines in a way that it it didn't used to be as as recently as a decade ago so it's it's a fraught issue for the

shocking number of America more than ten million state environmental protection as a core values\nBut who don't vote regular [noise] let's listen to ... how that works to turn those non voters voted [noise] Nathaniel ... welcome to climate was thank you Greg thank you for having me\nWhy are environmentalist such awful voters\nGosh you you ask the right question them and uh the honest answer is we don't know we've tried to research this and no matter how we asked the question\nWe always get back a really interesting and frustrating response and that is when we poll environmentalists who we know aren't voting the overwhelming majority of them Greg lied their pants off\nAnd swear up and down that they vote all the time and we know they're lying because whether you vote or not as public record and so the really interesting thing is we actually don't know\nKnow that people over report how often they vote\nThat race is an interesting point about how um [noise] people don't tell the truth to posters how do you ... how do you find in defined these environmental us\nWe at the environmental voter project because we're a voter mobilization organization\nDon't just want to mobilize casual environmentalists\nWe want to target and then mobilize people who care so deeply about climate in the environment that they listed as their number one priority or their number two priority over all others so that's how we defined environmentalists\nAnd then as far as how we find them\nWe conduct enormous polls will pull\nSomething close to ten thousand people per state and all will ask them as well say what's your number one most important political priority and what's your number two most important political priority and then will isolate the people who deeply care about climate and the environment\nAnd then our data scientist will look for a lot of hidden patterns in correlations that reveal who those people are\nAnd will use that information to build these models that help us identify every environmental less than a state and I know it sounds like a very complicated convoluted process but\nThis approach has actually how every sophisticated political campaign is now targeting voters\nVote when they don't tell the truth about how often they vote how do you know that they're telling you the truth of the environment a is a top one or two issue they may be just tell you what they think you want to hear how do you know they're telling you the truth in this case that's a great question that's a great question so the first thing that we\nDo is after we build these models\nTo an outside polling company and we said can you test or can you test the accuracy of these models and called these people up\nAnd ask them off the top of their heads what their top two political priorities are the worst score we've ever gotten in one of those tests the worst score is that eighty eight percent of the respondents off the top of their head have offered climate or the environment is one of their top two priorities\nHowever you might ask maybe they're lying again [laughter] may maybe these people just feel the urge to say that they care about climate and the environment when really deep down that they don't\nAnd that might be happening but it actually doesn't really matter because the way that policy is made in this country is that politicians poll likely voters\nTo figure out what issues they care about they don't pull non voters they only poll voters\nAnd when they find out what issues voters prioritize that's what politicians lead on politicians go where the votes are\nAnd so whether these voters are telling the truth or not if we can just get more of these people who said that they care about the environment to vote politicians will follow because nothing motivates politician more than the prospect of winning or losing an election\nAnd what percentage of Americans have environment or climate as a top one or two issue\nWe don't know how many Americans because we actually don't measure Americans we only ... registered voters\nAnd ... of the roughly two hundred million registered voters we've found twenty million who left climate change or some other environmental issue as one of their top priorities so that's about ten percent of the problem is those twenty million people\nMid term elections and only half of them only ten million voted in the twenties sixteen presidential election so that's why at the environmental voter project\nWe don't concentrate on trying to change people's minds we don't try to make new environmental is we just try to find the people who already deeply care about this issue yet aren't voting and we try to tweak their habits and turn them into better voters\nAnd how do you treat their how did you use psychology peer pressure what tools do you get people ah to to vote more frequently\nThe the punch line is the environmental voter project never talks about the environment ... and there's a very good reason for that it it doesn't work talking about climate change and talking about environmental issues might be a good way to persuade people to care about those issues but if you're already preaching to the choir\nAnd you just want to get them out the door on election day\nTalking about those issues doesn't work what we've realized\nIs that peer pressure and other forms of social pressure works the best so I'll give you some examples\nWe might send someone a letter saying Greg did you know last time there was an election Ninety three people in your building on main street turned out to vote\nI Know that sounds a juvenile and it is\nBut it works peer pressure works another thing that we do is we will send people copies of their personal voting histories and we'll say\nGreg I just wanted to remind you who you vote for a secret but whether you vote or not is public record and here's a copy of your voting history\nAnd some people are a little put off by that but at the end of the day it increases turnout dramatically because we've realized that even people who don't vote ...\nTo make a public pledge and follow up with them after the election tell us about\nThat that's exactly right and this is something that a lot of campaigns use and asking for a vote or the pledge to vote sounds very simple and it is but there's a lot of sophisticated behavioral science underneath that\nUnless you're a sociopath\nMost Americans want to be known as an honest and trustworthy person so if I get you Greg to promise to vote and then I mailed back a reminder of that pledge that you made it dramatically increases your likelihood of voting\nNot because you needed a reminder of win the election is\nBut rather because you want to keep your promises just like most people want to keep their promises\nAnd if our reminder says Hey Greg back in October you promised that you were going to vote while the elections on Tuesday and we know it's important to you to be an honest and trustworthy person\nAnd so this is your opportunity to keep your promise again it it it it feels like we're in middle school when you say that and it is very juvenile but it it works where social animals\nAnd we want to adhere to certain societal norms\nAnd if we can take advantage of that we can really change people's behavior in pretty dramatic ways\nThat being said it is still a very powerful tool and it does allow us and other political campaigns to now target people on an individual basis gone are the days when campaigns target by demographic group\nNo one looks for soccer moms are NASCAR dads anymore\nEvery campaign knows which individuals on the voter file they want to target and that's how they do it and we are not going to apologize one minute for using cutting edge techniques to try to solve the climate crisis\nWe need to find these people and make sure that they vote so we embrace this\nYou're listening to a special election episode climate wise

election day as part of the drive a ... program Greg doesn't ask Aaron how that effort aligned with ... others sustainability\nInitiative for seminarians things were coming to climate was thanks for having me so why is lift getting involved in drive the vote this election season\nWell lift has always been a company that has focused on values and we'd been a mission driven and Pfizer and company from day one and you know our goal is to improve people's lives where the world's best transportation and that means connecting people and communities to do the things that communities do one of the most important things that are community jazz is developed\nThere's other companies that jumped into this to a Levis Wal Mart a little bit Patagonia which closed all their stores and the twenty sixteen election so how did these particular companies come together was at the bar one I had it happen\nA that's a good question um I Can't say that I was there at the time when everyone got together at the bar or whatever it was but um you know I think that we're a a group of companies that believe strongly that I'm exercising you know our civic duty as citizens as corporate citizens and helping citizens of our democracy do that is fundamentally important\nAs so we came together to\nHelp our communities and in ways that we can uh exercise that right\nAnd I read research on your page showing that among youth\nNineteen percent uh with college experience cited transportation as an obstacle to getting to the polling place and thirty five percent of people youth with out college experience cited transportation as a problem those numbers were kind of ... high for me thinking that a lot of people vote by mail these days but\nIt sounds like transportation is a pretty significant obstacle to getting to vote\nIt is yeah um and you know I think across you know all populations transportation is a barrier to voting um you know vote by mail is not available in every jurisdiction so we want to make sure that we're helping folks to overcome those barriers\nHow are you going to find out who needs a ride or to the polls are you going to target a\nUrban rural you know inner city who how how's this going to work\nSo we're actually I'm offering this service to people across the country regardless of where you live what your political views might be you know this is really about helping everyone participate in our democracy\nUm and so what we're going to do what we are doing ... three parts I'm the first is registering to vote right you can't vote if you don't register the next part is I'm\nMaking sure that you know what your plan is for voting so just being aware of what the different ballot initiatives are and making a plan for the day of voting and studies show that\nAre folks who have taken the time to make a plan to figure out when you're voting to know where your polling places who you're going to vote with is it before work as it after work mom if you have a plan you're much more likely to actually follow through and vote and then finally on the day of the election itself\nGetting yourself to the polls of course is the third and final step devoting as well so we're actually addressing all three of those things by helping to inform a folks through our app and through our partners at a voter registration deadlines\nWe're also working with our partner organizations to now how people make a voting plan and then on the day of the election itself for offering discounted rides across the country to folks who may need that to help them get to the polls\nCompanies like lift no a lot about their customers did you use any data to try to target people who you think are likely voters or maybe unlikely voters to try to get them in\nSo that we left to our partners and I've I've mentioned out a few times I'm actually say who who they are um we're working with bugs feed 'em who actually provides the Web site where people can go look up their polling locations and then vote died or a nonprofit vote\nTurbo vote and vote or Latino and various uh local Urban League affiliates as well as in\nThey're the ones who are the experts who know you know which are the populations that have transportation barriers and and they're going to help get the word out to those specific populations\nIs at sixteen million voters that are potentially you know people who can be helped by transportation help that's one number I saw that I'm sure it's on your Web site that's quite a significant number\nThat's right yeah yeah Fifteen or sixteen million of folks who are already registered voters but who have cited transportation barriers as a reason why they are not able to vote or hadn't been able to vote in the past\nAnd how many people do you think you can reach this year and is this going to be something that's continued in twenty twenty or is this a kind of a mid term went off\nWell we'll see um actually this isn't the first time you've done this so back in twenty sixteen or we offered a rides to the polls just kind of adds to the polls in a handful of cities across the U.S\nAnd so I think this year out of this is sort of a a logical next step to expand that you know as lifts I'm a service offering has expanded across the country since that time right when our veteran available to Ninety five percent of the U.S population\nUm it just makes sense now to uh be increasing the reach 'em of this program as well\nIn the profile of Lyft riders I have an image of them is perhaps being younger tech savvy is that true\nUm you know lift is a again provide transportation to everybody we want to be a you know the world's best transportation service out there and that means we we want to be the service for everybody so um we're offering this to you know everybody regardless of\nA age regardless of race regardless of gender right this is to help every ... every citizen exercise that right\nBut you you need a smartphone and you're likely to me was uh twenty percent of Americans something like that uses service so it doesn't or are you saying that the the lift users don't skew young and kind of tech savvy\nWell we actually have a service called ... which is a way that people who may not actually have smartphones can still use ...\nAnd we've partnered with folks like the United way but there are two on one program um to offer a relief rises a whole whole different programs you can actually help to bring in populations that may not otherwise kind of de at the at the cutting edge of the Internet a world\nIf you're just joining us we're talking to Sam ... director of sustainability if the ride hailing company lift\nThis climate one I'm Greg Dalton or let's talk about sustainability which is really the core of what you do with the core of of climate one lift has its climate goals a hundred percent renewable energy how committed argue to lift cars being electric versus gasoline how are you going to reach that a hundred percent renewable\n[noise] well um you know one of the main reasons that left is found in the first place was to address the environmental impacts of our current system of transportation and the idea is if we can better utilize the car assets that we have out on the roads today\nAnd get more people into shared rides we can actually reduce emissions in that way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway
