some very\nBig and before that was the contentious confirmation battle for justice Brett Kavanaugh but through all those twists and turns a lot of important factors have remained constant pi democratic enthusiasm to vote\nLow approval ratings for the president and a lot of political history indicating Democrats should be poised for big wins in the house\n[noise] it's just a week and a half to go before\nElection day we're going to step back and take a closer look at the race for control of the house of representatives\nYou that we have NPR's Dominican much narrow Tim Mak\nHistorically and given some of the big picture trends Democrats really do have to wind up their backs let's walk through why exactly that is when presidents are in their first Mitt terms they lose a heck of a lot of seats on average is just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nHow they get compliance [noise] not here\nIn some of it has to do it frankly with the fact that people got their guy over the line they got their president and then they sort of a back off and the ... is perhaps the content in the settles in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies that the new president is putting in place\nFun facts on that so Gallup crunched the numbers a little bit earlier this year and they found that\nWhen the president's approval rating going into the midterms is below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest holds thirty nine percent\nThe president's party averages a loss of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent\nHis party tends to lose only fourteen states still last but not nearly as huge one Democrats have been incredibly enthusiastic all year ever since\nPresident Trump took office but in recent weeks we've seen Republicans finally getting engaged getting enthusiastic as well yeah and as you get closer to the election that tends to happen and Republicans the advantage that they wind up having is is a there are couple advantages that Republicans have\nYou know these elections are mostly taking place on the Republican turf\nIn the house you know most of these places are at least Republican leaning because Republicans have run up the score when it comes to state legislative chambers and governors' seats which are the ones that control redistricting so a lot of they won so many their control correct\nSo the interesting point here is that so much of that redistricting was only possible because so many state\nFirst term in twenty ten right and the other advantage that Republicans tend to have is the the demographic makeup of turnout is usually older whiter voters more likely to go to the polls and they make up a larger share of the Republican Party than for Democrats\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as Kemp likes to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning the Georgia flag back in the nineties that the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate assembled to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier national\nRaces this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for in the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well he's Abrams reaching and communicating\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but ... has done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStacey Abrams equal just spending time rating liberal [noise] she's an extremist canteen\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there eight rooms I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe even more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand eight Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand ... he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climb if she's going to win this race\nOr we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

happen on election day just about a week from recent maybe ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error every player politics however has\nIt at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and neck is this the race to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and if you weren't sure already confirmed this\nThis election it's all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only one with one another like a month or\nTo me now to talk through this NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of naps\nHappier people reading it well it looks like essentially that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans has kind of faded to be perfectly honest\nOr it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example the vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers are Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November six\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAs a twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they are motivated to go vote for Democrats because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this was about me get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this was a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking too though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corners Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important to compare\nYeah okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote fifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that so when we talked about gender divide and this is important is here\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential this year across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic men and democratic women alike dislike Trump and are going to vote Democrat\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks about independents they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans and a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look independence young voters Latinos\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in the midterm year so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this was going to be a base election which is a gamble than they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues\nAs we read the Democratic party is openly encourage terror of an after German animal league Williams to violate laws or\nHave a quick question though I mean when you say this is a base election I mean compared to presidential elections mid term elections are always kind of reactions right I mean is this year that much difference\nDoes the thing is with that is really fascinating I think raises a lot of alarm bells for Republicans\nIs that yeah usually these midterms are based elections but there are a lot of signs this year that there's going to be record turnout are you not only in me talking to Michael McDonald is a turnout expert at the

the votes ... meets weekly focused on one issue on voters' minds\nIt's going to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare [noise] with the Democrats happy Affordable Care act Republicans found one of their best talking for the used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing and we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has failed harsher tale of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this\nWith NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the healthcare as their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry a I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the healthcare system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle than Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for ... acceptable and not take it away like three hundred thousand North Dakota\nTo take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily willing away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act corrupt try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads come down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration\nScott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people uh but could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by\nBomb the care they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate build it didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative so unsettled voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that bill would have done away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks\nIn an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nThat's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions willing the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year I'm a democratic ads yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks these things here's how in building Democrats feel this year that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about health care Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nIs the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nJosh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying oh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what the ... support for insurance companies to cover all pre existing conditions\nWell that is a statement that you could argue is very much at odds with the lawsuit that he is a part of to unwind the Affordable CARE Act\nIf you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow here in the studio with NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben talking about health care so what is at the basis of all of this a focus on health care I mean do people care more about healthcare now than they did two years ago or four years ago\nOne is that Obamacare is somewhat more popular now than it was back during a lot of the Obama administration um if you look at polling data from say twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen Obamacare was generally seen net unfavorably more people seeing it on favorably than favorably\nThat flipped right around the time that Donald Trump took office right around January twenty Seventeen you started seeing people about evenly split or more likely than not to say to see it favorably", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "28"}
