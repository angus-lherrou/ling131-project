show from NPR I must have a holiday\nFor here to make sure that you're going to do and who you're going to vote for the you know about the candidates\nWere here with a special broadcast each through the mid term elections to keep you up to date on the major themes and racing\nI think you understand that but the stakes could not be a higher for this country\nTypically the president's party loses seats in mid term elections but nothing in politics is typical anymore needs\nTo go out and you need to vote Republican\nRepublicans have one of the most favorable Senate map any party has seen in years Democrats fighting to hold onto ten feet in states Trump won\nSo I don't think there's going to be influenced my hope there's or read word for\nIt time Democrats seem to have momentum center crews are not going to be honest with you with congresswoman\nOr leading the way two years of a\nPartisan circus now with only a little over two weeks to go to election day the races are tightening\nI Believe Arizona says our senator who just called the balls and strikes and you have a choice somebody wore the uniform\nOr someone who protested our troops\nWe want to get a reality check on where things stand\nMara Liasson and Scott Detrow hey everyone pay us my either the narrative has changed so many times is elections idol or are we just seeing a normal tightening\nIt was like early September just after the summer when everyone started hitting where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee and access all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is the right to do right well you know some of that has fallen back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will get to the cabinet confirmation battle and the fact that Republican enthusiasm spiked\nBut a lot of this is just natural tightening and in states like Tennessee and Texas there just happen to be more Republicans there\nWe started the cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they could pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about this cycle is that those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness and the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nWe've entered that final few weeks of an election that's kind of the dark side of the moon where there's not many from data points but suddenly you see wild shift in how a political observers view things the Democrats might be fine after all the Democrats might be totally screwed [laughter] I I think it's just hard to tell especially in\nA midterm where it seems legitimate that enthusiasm is higher than before we just don't know what that means in terms of who shows up to vote compared to typical midterm\nStill I have to talk about a few specific races that we're looking at maybe we could all just go around and talk about what particular race has been really interesting to\nLooking at Florida the governor's race there is probably the most important race in the country because Florida is the mother of all swing states in a presidential year and Donald Trump really wants to Republican to be the governor of Florida when he runs for re election\nThe bare bones of these he is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House Don McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national ... Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney ... baloney who is well known in Republican legal circles but while Siblani is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and and in flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nYou feel like as I'm listening to describe all of this feels Harry insider eight to me right in terms of who's who and who they all watch for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in at pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks and is that fair assessment\nIs a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be heard and when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court in appeals\nOne thing you just mentioned earlier and name that Robert Mueller and McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been\nHandling much of the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative\nArrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nAnd do you want to ask you about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution and the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for a very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about his brand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution and the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other begin drawing that lines never been easy but it's never been more important\nAlright well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nThis is the politics show from the NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back\nSupport for ... three W CPS news provided by like involve old cars Cleveland alike in Motor Company celebrating their fiftieth anniversary as a family owned and operated dealer since Nineteen sixty eight located in Willoughby with new and certified ... vehicles more like in motor dot com\nCleveland Clinic hosting the medical innovation summit October twenty second through the twenty fourth the sixteenth annual summit looks at breakthroughs and challenges in health care more at medical innovation summit dot C.

H. Y. Y. Joe thanks for joining us great to be here do you mean you could start with you can you know it's just a lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him\nAuthoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare and won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district you talk to us a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was a little bit more detail about who lives in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kind of goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so\nIt's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nThe Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter this I mean given her talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nWhen you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I and the cement\nLet's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of seat that goes in general is that\nWhat you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters of talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district\nIs it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really what had changed\nCurrent health care structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip\nFrom twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it in their favor as the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September\nThat were run we're about health care and most of those work ... and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were healthcare\nRelated that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support\nBack foot on the issue that got them house and the first place that NPR ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY

bearing down on the Florida Panhandle it is welcome back to the politics show from NPR\nAnd most of my college or the Mendocino Complex fire is the largest wildfire in state history or here with a special broadcast but through the mid term elections and every week we focus on key issues that voters are going to be facing this fall\nPowerful Hurricane Maria making landfall white now on Puerto Rico as\nThis week to climate change for this one was Jones is Muslim when Obama was elected president he made climate change a core part of his platform he touted citing the Paris climate accord as a major achievement\nAnd today the world has officially cross the threshold for the parents agreements with very different but fast forward it twenty Eighteen we're going to kids do the Paris climate agreement\nPresident Trump now ... pulling out of the accord is one of his major achievements and he says it's one reason Americans should vote for Republicans as fall\nBut since Trump was elected president the country has experienced some major environmental crises and Democrats are warning that trumps the regulations are one reason climate change is getting worse and joining me to talk about all of this is NPR's Ayesha Rascoe who covers the White House and end NPR's Nate Rott who covers the environment\nHe ate at just a couple of weeks ago the United nations released a fairly large comprehensive climate report that I Will say as a layperson a seemed pretty dire um what what are the experts saying at this point about climate change and specifically what did we get from that report\nLonger the short of it was essentially that the world is not doing enough to cut carbon dioxide even with the commitments that you know\n... you know massive amounts of carbon dioxide or the atmosphere and warming is going to reach a really dangerous level far sooner than people think possibly and my last time assuming a you know live through LA traffic and certainly in the lifetime of our children which I think is kind of shocking for a lot of people\nYeah it seems sooner than I had certainly anticipated some of these threats becoming a reality which was really eye opening\nAnd I should say that since the twenty sixteen election I think there have also been a number of pretty large scale natural disasters California had its largest wildfire in state history and\nJust last week hurricane Michael was the strongest storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history so I'm curious how you ... if you get a sense of\nWhether voters see the environment as an issue that is being discussed politically\nI don't think voters see it as a top issue it usually in polling it's something that voters do care about uh but it's not a top issue it's not like health care or those kind of like bread and butter issues not because it's not important but I think because just as you just talked about it seems like\nFor people it feels like it's far away is something that can do
