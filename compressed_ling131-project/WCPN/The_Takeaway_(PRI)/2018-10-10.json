seven point five magnitude earthquake offshore\nThe Indonesian government installed a system of twenty two boys to help detect pressure changes are related to the formation of a tsunami but\nThey haven't been functional in years and the new system to be anchored to the ocean floor and less vulnerable to vandalism was awaiting the green light for deployment when it was rejected for lack of funding just days before the most recent disaster struck\nUniversity of Pittsburgh political science professor Luis comfort worked with teams of researchers in the U.S and Indonesia to develop and under the sensor network to detect some nominees professor comfort joins us now\nPreparing for extreme events like Saddam is\nIndonesia is in a very risk prone environment a Seventeen thousand islands and counting it has a major earthquake over seven point\nMagnitude on the Richter scale every year at least every year it's vulnerable also to sue nominees and volcanic eruptions so this is a major challenge for the country\nAnd of course what little more than a decade ago there was a huge catastrophic tsunami of up there in Indonesia\nYes two thousand for a sit down I mean at the tip of northern Sumatra ... and ... literally one in three people in that city were killed\nI was there two and a half months after the tsunami that seeing the devastation and still it was the stench of dead bodies two and a half months it's just sobering and\nIt's this kind of experience that has made me so intent on trying to do what is possible to support decision making for the public managers that these these horrifying situation\nSo I understand that the proposal to get these sensors installed in western Sinatra stalled in fact just a few days before this latest sue nominee hit a I guess it was due to funding concerns how did you react when you heard the news\nI was profoundly disappointed profoundly disappointed\nToo there were two parts to this project what is the undersea network that provides the initial near real time warning and then the second is the network of electronic devices essentially\nA cell phones handheld cell phones that enable people in the community\nTo do the deployment this long September October\nThe Indonesian agency the M cagey was very interested\nIn this proposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agreed that people should wear seatbelts broke it wasn't enough money for everyone to have one unfortunately that's exactly the case but I understand that there was a system of bullies there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project on Indonesia supported by the U.S and Germany had twenty two movies that were operating and designed actually to provide a similar data from the ocean floor change in the\nWater pressure in the water column\nBut those buoys actually had been vandalized\nAnd we're not functioning and as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP T\nThat manage the movies actually cancelled that program because they were not able to keep them operational so the ... had not been operating since two thousand sixteen\nNow what are the advantages of the system that you helped to develop over this now defunct system of bullies\nThe major difference is it is anchored to the ocean floor so it cannot be vandalized and it uses a very interesting scientific phenomena end\nOf the ceremony kind of warm equatorial waters to enable a Christie communication that is underwater

is what the whales use huh\nExactly that's exactly right\nTo what extent has the prospect of now the Indonesian government changed given this recent disaster\nWell I Hope that has changed right now I'm certain that they're full attention is on the immediate recovery but I Do hope that the agencies will reconsider is is very important part of their overall sit down in the early warning

I mean it's a it's a gift beyond description and it was wonderful to be able to be there but I think that [noise]\nOf the enormous beaches and the remarkable vision that President Kennedy had Dickey rate the Cape cod seashore national monuments so we're we're very lucky people and uh\nOur history goes way back obviously made everybody during the Arab Seventeen hundreds Eighteen hundreds early sixteen hundreds came here on a boat and we have always had a tie our history to\nThe sea and in our merchant efforts or the China trade the caught on top of the state huh cod wailing or and\nYou know we don't have God no I mean this ought to be a message to everybody it's Cape Cod that they're no God\nWho are very very few and precious field and it's a it's a tragedy if we don't start paying attention to how we manage these kinds of things we could see an economic impact on our state so what do we need to do today to take care of our I think there are three primary\nChallenges a number one\nClimate change which is caused by greenhouse gases which fall in the ocean and the ... the ocean which has a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world\nAre we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate of impacts we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic impact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern\nThe second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build the building near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution you I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have high nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen and water and therefore\nDead zones nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I seen film of a shark send or board busses end or whales dragging nets around and dragging plastic around it's crazy\nAnd then finally we have over fishing we have too much money chasing too few fish\nAnd that's one of the reasons I make cod anymore here eight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of this sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones\nAnd the others or at or near max so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi\nOr with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and therefore appetite we have a huge challenge and already about Trump's protein that people get in the world comes from fish\nSo there's a huge demand for fishes food stock and increasingly we're going to say pressure on that so those are the biggies but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty Thirty years\nNow of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think he spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat\nBut when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about ... about to one there's something called the law the sea treaty was something that the United states and the folks from Massachusetts like Eliot Richardson worked on years ago which we've never ratified and now there's talk of having some sort of a high seas treaty\nUm that would govern what is half of the world is not in any jurisdiction\nOverfished by renegade fishers pirates fisherman and years ago Senator Ted Stevens and I went to the United nations to try to ban the drifting that fishing\nWe succeeded it was banned but today you have pirates fishermen renegade fishermen who go out with addressing that addressed net is literally thousands of miles of model filament netting that they dropped behind the boat dragged along\nIt kind of strip mines the ocean and as much as two thirds of the catch\nCertainly fifty percent is called waste cash they just throw it overboard so it's changing the ecology of the ocean by imagine if the vision of a you'll see a strip mining coal or in the land you see it just ravaging everything around that this is what address that will do\nAnd then sometimes it breaks off and it becomes what we called the ghost in it because it just fishes on its own when it's weighted down the carcasses it sinks to the bottom scavengers clean it off it rises to the topic again until it gets tangled in a whale or tangled in the propellers of some boat\nIt's a scourge and we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little enforcement I should say occasionally\nSomeone's military ship goes through it and you can check on who's who and what's happening and you can certainly mark what ships\nAre they're fishing so we're over fishing talked to me about the climate and your concerns about climate change\nFacing massive challenge of dealing with climate refugees the prime minister of the Fiji Islands I I just met with them the other day at an event in California where he pointed out that they're literally taking refugees from other islands\nAnd they themselves are now planning how to move where can they go to be safe they are going to lose their nation state which is these islands\nAnd the storms because of that moisture we're seeing it in a hurricane's we've seen last year\nJust three hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria\nCost the taxpayer two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the defense department budget for you think of that three storms and it's going to get worse so people who sit there and say well we can't afford to do something or we can't it's crazy it is far more expensive to do nothing or to do very little\nThan to actually step up and try to deal with the problem with climate change and why because the answer to the problem of climate change is energy energy policy we have the solutions solar today is less expensive than coal but people are still using coal if we shouldn't be we can't be using coal\nBecause it's the dirtiest fuel there is and we got to move off of coal onto the alternative renewables they're there and we need the leadership that does it and regrettably this president and his administration are not only not dealing with climate", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "10"}
