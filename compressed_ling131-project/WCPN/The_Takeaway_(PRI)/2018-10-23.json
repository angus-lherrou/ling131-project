front page of the New York times and countries we're moving toward Rio to to do something about it and trying to feel like they had to be part of the parade is that right\nThat's right climate change was not at the top of China's list at the time but it had already been done to research the issue of how climate change might affect China\nAnd what steps China might take\nSo when this meeting occurred China had already developed its own set of internal climate negotiation guidelines and many of those guidelines made their way into the Beijing declaration\nWhich was the result of this meeting the joint developing country position and many of those guidelines went on to find their way into the framework convention on climate change at real\nFast forward two thousand seven you write

E. A. and others estimate that just within a few years solar power will be the lowest cost resource in much of the world and same for wind\nPart of that is because of China apply that's a manufacturing juggernaut to solar uh they drove down the price drove both U.S companies out of business in the process a consumers benefit of but now it's a subject of a trade war or who tell us where that is right now or the solar tariffs in the trade war so\nDonald Trump imposed a thirty percent tariff on solar panels from any other country any foreign country I think this is very misguided because China's low cost solar panels\nHave driven the U.S solar industry to be one of the fastest growing industry\nMaintenance and in fact the job of solar panel installer\nWas listed as the fastest growing job category in the United states until these terrorists were imposed and the solar energy Industries Association in the United states opposed the imposition of terrorists for this reason [noise]\nYou're listening to a climate one conversation with China expert Barbara them are coming up we'll hear more about China's emerging green economy and Carter Roberts that the world Wildlife Fund talks about partnering with major corporations to help the planet\nEvery company navigating they bring to social issues differently when we're at our best when we encourage companies it'd be unique strengths lay up not just reducing their footprint but using your muscles for good [noise] that's up next when climate one continuous [noise]\nEvery year Idea Stream asks for your thoughts on our region's biggest assets and challenges\nIn order to better inform our programming in coverage for this year's listening project assets\nAnd challenges survey we liked her answers to the following question is what a northeast Ohio top five assets what are the top five assets that you bring to the humidity what are your top five personal challenges and water northeast Ohio top box challenges answer those questions on line right now what ideas dream dot org slash lp\nThat's ideas dream dot org slash lp thanks oh\nIn New Jersey health care is a major issue when a hotly contested congressional race incumbent Tom MacArthur ran and twenty sixteen on a pledge to repeal the Affordable care\nNow following through on that promise could be one call in his ... I mean ... joined me for that story on the next MORNING EDITION starting at five AM on your NPR station Ninety points\n\nWe continue now with climate one great Dalton is talking about China's unexpected emergence as a climate change leader disgusted fiber if in a more author of will China's save the planet let's get back to their conversation you writes that\nWas we were talking about cars in China\nElectric cars that they're cleaner but it's still a car centric\nOrientation and people who are involved in urban and some there are so many buildings and so many um cities growing so quickly in China's people move from the countryside to urban areas how China urbanized who's will have a big impact on the climate equation and are they still building car centric cities\nWhether their electric or whatever\nThey are taking on a lot of the worst\nQualities of our own urban development or we it in her D.C actually have been doing a study every year of all Chinese cities to determine\nWill walk ability index how well are they are supporting walking\nAnd they have a long way to go they have a long way to go for what they are focused on as I said before shared mobility in fact the charging station infrastructure is really focused also on the buses eat taxis and ah and shared vehicles\nI was in Shanghai I Lived in Shanghai in the late eighties I was there in two thousand six went back four years later their head of the subway head exploded all over the place it was amazing how many miles of subway they built in just a few years\nChina's national petroleum company forecast peak gasoline sales by twenty twenty five that's state owned company you don't hear\nExxon saying peak gasoline sales by twenty twenty five is real it is\nThe equivalent in oil demand of the medium sized country every year and most of that oil is imported China does not want to be in that situation that's why they're putting such a heavy emphasis on electric vehicles\nSo that they get this on whatever it is they're they're more energy independence to something a huge infrastructure project called belt and road which is conducting the ports in the highways of Asia\nWith Europe to facilitate the trade kind of along very old silk route some concerns about this is some form of economic\nUm you know binding countries are Chinese investment but what's the carbon dioxide climate impact of all the infrastructure massive belt and road\nIts belt and road initiative may become the largest infrastructure project in world history it covers Seventy countries in four continents\nTwo thirds of the world's population and when you include China these belt and road countries are responsible for sixty percent of the world's sealed to admissions so the decisions that China makes in what kind of\nA an investment in infrastructure it provides is really going to play a major role in the globe's ability to meet our parish commitments and go beyond\nI think of lease Scott got started Walmart on their sustainability people talk about a lot about Paul pull man had Unilever off at times after there's a really green CEO\nThe next CEO isn't quite as green because they don't feel like they ... as much can you think of the company where there was a really green CEO followed by an equally passionate green CEO\nYeah here's what I Know about CEOs is one one myself as an every CEO wants to put their own marketing come down and a smart was built on the best things that their predecessors did but they make they put their own mark on it I'm Leigh Scott\nAnd his made it one of the signatures of his work in that company and his conviction that they are a company full of good people who wants to make a difference in the world and Dave sustainability has become a hallmark of that company\nWhen metal list L. stepped down as the c._e._o. of coke he was succeeded by moved to our cat and a mood to our put his own mark on sustainability by\nI'm continuing to work on water but also combining that with coax leadership on women's issues and looking at water and women in the context of the world as um two pillars of their sustainability and social impact work [noise]\nSo what we've seen is the best companies find a way to continue it because\nIt's not just a marketing tool it is fundamental to who they are and their comparative advantage with coke or they were determined because of a water crisis to become a leader on water\nAnd Walmart is determined to be a leader on sustainability and um McDonalds has been after the sustainability issues for twenty five years and didn't realize that you know they're um they started way back in the day\nWhen I'm a young staffer and Environmental Defense fund work with them to eliminate Styrofoam packaging and both the ATF\nWhere my wife worked and McDonald's received a prize the rose garden for those initial steps and looking at supply chains and now they built on that but the science space targets initiative that brings that to scale so the best companies it becomes\nPart of the warp and woof of who they are and it just changes leader a leader\nI certainly know from Walmart they don't do anything that doesn't make economic sense there is no squishy numbers that everything has to save energy as a proxy for waste saving waste is saving money\nHave learned his every company is different to generalize companies that your peril in for Wal Mart delivering goods to people at the lowest possible price is fundamental to their business model and part of the power of the shift that were noble energy and\nAvoiding food waste and more efficient transportation is it removes cost from their supply chain and unable to deliver the lowest possible price to the consumer\nFor coke it's a company that it's a marketing engine and their ability to reach people make them aware of the issues of water create a movement um water um make people feel like they're part of a solution is a lot of the motivation for coke\nAnd so what we've learned is every company is different every company navigates what they bring to social issues differently\nAnd the smart ones use their um uh ... what I called her superpowers whether its supply chain to power the buyer marketing\nIn Silicon valley it's about engineers are helping solve problems of the day or when we're at our best is when we engage companies and the unique strengths they have not just reducing their footprint but using their muscles forget [noise]\nYou're listening to the conversation about harnessing corporate power to combat climate change with Carter Roberts

but Donald Trump nailed to the u._s. was going to leave the Paris Agreement\nIt said shutters throughout American society and particularly the environmental moved in on that day one of our staffers reached out to Mayor Bloomberg sauces\nAnd a handful of NGOs started something called we are still live with\n[noise] to formally sign on to a statement that they were still in their institutions are still in the Paris Agreement and committed to make progress against climate change\nThat coalition now includes thirty five hundred institutions across the country represent half the country's population and half the country's GDP\nThat's a lot of power and a lot of people are looking for cities and states to ... to make up the gap from the federal government not only stopping but going trying to push backwards on the U. S. commitments to Paris\nThere was a report recently from data driven Yale which said that all city state and company commitments we'd get the U.S halfway to Paris commitment\nSo cities and states are not enough\nSo are you a glass half empty person or a glass half full for me getting halfway there through sub national a commitment is a good thing\nI think some people are claiming city in states can forget Donald Trump's cities and states can can can really feel it of course you know happier with cities and states but I think they're that their contribution and isn't some environmental corners being over so\nThink it's being appropriately captured as taking a big chunk out of the problems that we have for making forward progress at a time when our federal government is not doing what it should do\nAnd creating the foundation for the momentum to lead to a moment where we would put a price on carbon and we would create regulatory framework that matters because\nThe at some point in the future of the next president and the next Congress will wake up and see thousands of commitments being made by companies are different shapes and sizes who's gonna see\nRegulatory frameworks in cities and states that are of different shapes and sizes and there will be enormous pressure and movement for us to have a predictable rely\nLater so to me all these work stream some sub national action is all about demonstrating that action is happening\nIs it more is needed a comparing solutions and creating relationships where it can happen\nBut keeping the pressure on that a national regulatory framework is too important and all of the nation to the world when they get back together again in Poland or going to have to double down on their commitments because\nWe are not on path\nTo reach that goal set in Paris\nAnd there's quite a debate actually within some environmental groups about\nThat in fact not being on path and some will say don't tell the truth about how far off the path\nThe global economy is because that will bump people out and this incentivize them ... you know don't don't tell grandma how bad her cancer as cars and grandma won't heal as well\nAnd others who say hey we got to get real and and tell the truth and there's some there's quite a tussle sometimes it's quite messy between the messaging where do you follow that come down on that", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "23"}
