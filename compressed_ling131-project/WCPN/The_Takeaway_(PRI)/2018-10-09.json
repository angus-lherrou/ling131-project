ultimately it does transform the world [noise]\nFirst here's great conversation with Christiana care is\nI I really remember your predecessor or even to bore who was you know led the United nations climate summit negotiations in your position and he was pretty frightening grizzled at the end of a seemed like you know I've been a long haul for him but you came in and and took over that position and then you [noise]\nIn this position [noise] tell us about the experience when you hit bottom and kind of from Buddhism as well\nYeah I guess there were two different moments one was um just walking into that responsibility um and and I do remember um the first press conference that I had when you know we were all still ... from the\nPain of um of Copenhagen\nAnd I was off by a I'm a journalist and I have not done my press training so my pressed him was sitting there and you're going like oh my God what is she going to say because the question was ... and when do you think wherever you know do you think we're ever going to be able to reach a global agreement\nAnd the first thing that came out of my mouth was not in my life [laughter]\nReally helpful [laughter] am I\n... see him as like frozen [laughter] let's get her to some press training [laughter] um\nBut again it was a fun topic teachable moment for me right because I had actually never thought about that question I had never thought about the consequences of not having a global agreement and the moment that it came out of my mouth I kind of looked at myself you know when you have a distance or isn't good\n... who ... who is that person which set died because that is so irresponsible and it is so unacceptable and that's the moment when it's a bright [noise]\nMy commitment here is to change that because I think I had voice\nThe global mood on climate change and I I realized my commitment in my task here is to change that global mood and of course I Can't change the little motive I change my cell because as we know all change starts with cells so that started off a journey\nI've actually done this because I Am a victim of something prior\nI I Know I did not because you know I'm pretty soon you're three hundred years back right\nAnd ... and you you engaged in this seesaw of victim perpetrator and everybody is a victim and perpetrator if you engage in that die and dynamic\nYou are a victim and perpetrator at different points in time with different people with different situation and you're into this your whole life\nAnd and I saw that happening in the negotiations I sign happening with developing country\nDeveloping countries whose representatives were absolutely convinced that they are victims they are objectively victims of climate change but they don't have to stay there we can get out of the victim perpetrator dynamic\nAnd as I began to bring myself out of mind dynamic of victim and perpetrator I began to see the negotiation shift\nAnd I began to see people you know not looking back and blaming but rather\nHonoring the reality um because there was a huge responsibility of developed countries and at the same time we can to look forward\nAnd say we have a common responsibility yes there's historic responsibility in the back but there is a forward looking common responsibility that has to do with the future of the planet in the future of all human beings on the planet\nAnd it was so remarkable to me right to say wow you know I and I'm ... on his he's still working on that\nBut to see that emerge in the bigger system was just so humbling to me right now I'm not going to say that it was a causal relationship by absolutely was not unconnected\nThere definitely was an emergence of a different way\n[noise] you know he is he is the difficulty we cannot be exceptional ... partners\nOkay we cannot um and while while what they do makes me very angry it does not dissipate my spiritual love for them because they were also on this planet\nAnd my challenge is to spread and my art of love over those that are close to me that I Love that you know are in my sphere but also to spread that article globe over those that we don't we went over people that we have never met\nOr people that you know maybe they are we think are inconsequential tour lives they're not we're all interconnected and you know even the Koch brothers with whom I've had fascinating conversations [noise] um [noise]\nDo something good even in than there is something good even in oil companies even in coal companies you know the moment that you engage in the blaming game and demonizing a person a company a sector you've lost you have lost your game\nYou the moment you start doing that you come down into a different level from which is going to be very difficult to emerge because someone is going to have to win and someone is going to lose and\nThat's not the space that I Want to work and I want to work in the space in which we [noise]\nYou're listening to a climate one conversation

mindfulness break out in this talking with un climate negotiator Christianity guarantee about how Buddhist teachings help her state that is a mistake picture [noise]\nLet's get back to their conversation [noise]\nWhen I Want to ask you your head of mission twenty twenty which the tagline is the need for speed there's a lot of urgency and climate people we have to do more faster so my question is how can be sure that you're being mindful\nAnd going fast is it possible to go slower and smarter because I feel so much anxiety driving action any kind of action is good in climate I'm not sure people are\nThe ... tradition as well you were taught mindfulness by slowing down and I think that that's very helpful because um because it takes you into a completely different space from from where we are normally during the day and however um\nYou can definitely be mindful speed\nAnd given the physical reality of climate change there's no way that we can slow down so for me mindfulness is much more about intention ... than it is about speed it is much more about um being grounded and\nSeeing where everything comes from than um than about stopping action it's about truly understanding that there is a\nBeautiful alignment that goes all the way through us\nI'm I'm back down and end up that alignment to put it into you know the outside world that that is the climate that we have to see of climate action among you know individuals are communities cities states governments that alignment is the parallel alignment\nThat we need to see and express and live by in our own personal life if we're not aligned with can expect anybody else to be in line to mindfulness for me is not about necessarily slowing down when I Can't if I can then I definitely do it but it's not about slowing down it's about\nThe ... of the intention and it's about\nKnowing where the energy the spirit the wisdom comes from it and come from us right doesn't come from it it there is a much greater power here that he's helping us out thank heavens sorry about that one\nLast question is um there's something called the hope poise switches people fearing for climate people need to be hopeful because ah\nThat I should be optimistic more than I really am because that's what we'll be affective\nI see a lot about in climate people saying [noise] I'm really not going to say how dark it is because I think I should tell people it's brighter because that was will be easier to receive them the dark troops\nDon't you think you can see through that\nFake optimism yeah yeah so what's the point I think it's widely practiced well\nBut but but that's not the the you know that's not what we ... we don't we don't pursue widely practice anything we pursue um attitudes and actions to have an impact which is different than popularity I'm On\n... and\nI ... I think you know that that alignment inside um and the clarity of the reason why you're optimist we'd which in climate in particularly you can't be optimistic irresponsibly sale you know it's it's it's going to be OK in order to know you have to have\nOptimism in the sense thought\nWe know that we have to engage in this challenge from a positive starting point if you start going into your work on climate saying well actually you know it's all doom and gloom and it's not going to go anywhere all guess what it won't go anywhere so\nRight and and Christian or talked about look being able to look for it at our shared responsibility and when we're in that state of loneliness and fear those are actually really valuable feelings the really important teachers yet if we stay only in that it's like we only listen to this one loud voice\nIt's going to be really hard for us to do the work of connecting across different about finding a shared compassion about finding the courage inside ourselves to actually listen to each other\nSo I think what it means is just as the seas are getting heavier Caesar rising literally the emotional fees are rising and that means we have to work harder\nThink that disconnection from from each other is not unrelated toward disconnection with the world and the and the wider system as well and when when evolution I'm also seeing is mindfulness I'm\nOriginally seen as a mean individual practice you know my own focus et cetera and realizing more and more I Know it's it's a mindful ecosystem you know even in his ear in a secular way and that this is not a new idea\nThat whole cultures have been built built around this but realizing oh we need to create cultures and corporate structures and communities than actually integrate these principles and not just\nA moment by moment focus that really do include like the kind of intention the Christian I was talking about because how we approach these issues is just as important as what we do and I think that goes to back back to what you were saying about slowing slowing down or at least how are we present and aware\nAs we make decisions in a real way and\nThis is climate line coming up more of our conversation on mindfulness practices\nAnd some questions from our live body [noise] how can we use fear as a positive inclusive energy rather than thinking of it's just something that we should close on protect ourselves that the next one sign that one can\nI'm Neal Conan and I'm Heather ... with the democracy tests and we begin with a simple question why democracy

a month now before election day plus details on efforts to increase digital equity in Cleveland [noise]\nYou're listening to climate wind down this talking with ... at the San Francisco Zen center\nAnd Joshua Friedman author of several books on emotional intelligence and the c._e._o. is six seconds [noise] that's hit that today a conversation about mindfulness and find that [noise]\n... ah there's a lot of debate these days about the attack on science our country facts you know we've got to be fact based certainly climate people scientists talk a lot about facts um there are important but what is the shadow side of science and the facts and what do they do to our emotions\nWell you know it's sort of funny like let's just be rational about this [laughter] okay well if we're going to be rational we're going to confront the reality that human beings and not just rational [laughter] so I see myself as a scientist and I'd love data and what I Know about neuroscience is that\nWhat happened is our brains are kind of use it or lose it tools and as we developed a certain aspects of our brain uh we suppress others ... so whatever it is we're actively using a there's a set of neural networks that govern our ability to connect with our own emotions and with each other\nAnd those are different neural networks then govern our ability to analyze a quantitative data\nThe result my capacity to do to activate this other network actually diminished and so now I've spent the last Twenty years trying to get both of those two things able to work\nSo I think for um for us to be really scientific about it is to be able to embrace why we're doing the science and\nTo make sure that as scientists as citizens as human beings we're integrating all of these different aspects of ourselves and developing ourselves in a more balanced way\nI interviewed a Bill Nye recently and he actually is a documentary of his life and there's a\nPart where they are looking at his brain to see of being famous changes someone's brain or inflate certain parts and actually that actually she can now see that more as a therapy actually changes the structure talk therapies changes the structure of brain as does does mindfulness Meg living mindfulness\nYes so you are than other development is understanding the difference between just um [noise]\nParticular states in a given moment there may be doing some kind of practice and if you're practicing regularly over time especially longer practices how that comes actually more of a a trait\nThat versus like okay now I'm going to my mind from this is just if you actually practice that regularly you naturally are more mindful and an interesting I'm bit of research I I highly recommend the book altered traits\nDavidson and Daniel Goldman which talks about some of these ... more recent findings that\nFor a longer term met his haters some of the the room a nation that we naturally do in our our brains that's all about me and myself into that actually calms down something and then also the tendency to want to attach to idea the idea of ourself to other things that also\nBecomes more relaxed and one of the ... one of ...\nThere's mindfulness they also includes things like developing compassion which initially um\nActivates a very pro social part of the brain versus simply empathy and feeling the pain with if you're caught if you're actually cultivating the sense of wishing wells for hoping to relieve the suffering you are shifting either way you're seen yourself on the world\nAnd so for me these basic practices how do we go to the gym and a sense and get in shape so that when we're we're in this dynamic situation and he's dynamic challenges that we're able to stay present and balanced and responsive and sustainable way\nAnd I think that Christians talked about that as well right that extending our ability to be compassionate ... ah it's you know even with the stranger even with antagonist and finding that shirt connectedness but you know I think something we've talked about before Greg is about how we\nIn the face of something like climate we can feel really powerless ... and I think the message that I Would want to leave people with is that your emotions are a source of power\nAnd that this ability to grow compassion is one of the most powerful things we can do is human beings and it transforms us drones are relationships and ultimately it does transform the world\nIt's not an easy process but our emotions are there for a reason to guide us towards that kind of way of interacting Josh what do you think about there was a myth of urgency [noise]\nSo [noise] um the best selling business book in the Nineteen nineties for John Carter he talks about the need to create urgency in a burning platform and it's you know the shrinking iceberg um and the notion that we changed because of urgency and yes we do\nAnd that again that's not a bad like that's useful mhm at times but it has to also be balanced with\nSome of the reasons why we feel the fear like we only feel fear because we feel mhm right we if if we don't care if I don't care if I ... you know I don't feel fear about you know crossing this ravine right so\nThe urgency is easily slips into like let's create fear\nAnd what happens when we create fear we can see it in our country today we can see it in so many countries today when we create fear we create to visit his we create this false disconnection from one another we create this short sighted thinking and I\nI think we understand you know the sort of basic piece of emotional intelligence that emotions are there to guide and and motivate us we need to bring forward the a bigger range of emotions that are going to serve us to achieve the goals that we have like
