came ashore in the panhandle of Florida on October tenth it shredded buildings with the sheer force of its category for wins and swept away entire neighborhoods with an eight to twelve foot storm surge\nMichael is the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States it pass through quickly though and dropped less rain and other recent major hurricane such as Laurence Harvey Irma and Maria [noise]\nOnly the Labor Day hurricane of Nineteen thirty five and hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine had lower barometric pressure is a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by how hurricane Michael intensified from a category one to the category for just twenty four hours\nHere to talk about this unprecedented storm and it's possible Climate Connections we welcome another Michael back to the show Michael Mann is the climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back to living on earth Michel thanks deep it's good to be with you\nSo why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nIt encountered warm a sea surface temperatures on in the low eighties in the region where it intensified and became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two\nWarm there there's just a fluke or we're looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat wave and an ocean heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nA hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into storm surge these days\nWell you know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast or has been somewhere between half a foot in the foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy and twenty twelve at at a ... foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge might sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several\nBillion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quick pop up\nOf the things that we're seeing with warming warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons from a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two\nAnd that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more\nOf these very intense storms these category ... you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest in fact there's a relationship\nFor a category five storm you get an increase of roughly seven percent in the ...\nSpeed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes as the third power of the wind speed\nSo it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm that's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human caused warming\nYou know the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report is saying that the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of\nGlobal every surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius above the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more than one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial age\nYeah so for each you know half a degree Celsius it's the better part of one degree Fahrenheit right there that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storms that means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius and you have a about four percent\nMore moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past uh the PCC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nYeah so I I criticize this latest report for once again being overly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very ...\nTo measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that is well that's how far back with their mom and her measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened makes it that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point five two point oh\nOr there's still a clear path toward stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius but it turns out that if you look at our budget how much carbon do we have left that we can burn in avoid two degrees Celsius\nYou take in what might sound like a small factor\nThe use of an earlier more appropriate baseline for measuring the warming relative to the pre industrial you have about half as much carbon that you can burn so it was for that specific reason\nThat um that that I criticized uh this report as being overly conservative again it made some choices that in my view understate the amount of warming that's already happened in in the U.S over states the amount of carbon we still have left to burn\nSo let's talk about the carbon budget how many ... tons of carbon as a modern society tossed into the atmosphere on an annual basis and how much more room is there\nLiving on Earth I'm Steve her with the more things change the more they stay the same goes the French aphorism and popular author Barbara Kingsolver has a brilliant take on these unsettling time in her new novel on sheltered\nIt's a creative look at a family crisis in modern America Laird over the narrative of a story that unfolded in the same New Jersey town over a century earlier\nVineland New Jersey was first settled in the late Eighteen hundreds as utopian experiment and the social issues there as imagined and Barbara Kingsolver book on sheltered resonate equally with America's reality back then and\nIs your first novel and what six years so brought you the idea of writing what became an sheltered no\nWell it's one of those books that took a while to cook\nI spent several years thinking about\nHow to write about paradigm shift that's what I think we're doing right now I think we're in the moment\nWhen so many things that we've always believed in as truth unquestionable are suddenly starting to feel not true anymore it's a moment that feels like crisis like the end of the world as we know it\nAnd want to say permanent truth things like\nWell like\nThere will always be a job at the end of the college degree or tenure at the end of the track or or a a pension at the end of a career or good health care or even things like ice\nOn the polls that will stay frozen or that there will always be more efficient the see we're reaching a moment in history when all those shelters are failing us\nSo your device if I can use that word of course is to have to families yeah living more than a century apart yeah in the same house right and of course it's falling down literally it's literally falling down and that's another\nThing that is in question these days where is it safe to live you know the occasional hurricane or maybe there's going to be a a a huge forest fire or or whatever in fact you yourself you move from the south west back to Virginia because you could see that there ain't going to be too much water there there was\nAny factly exactly that that was already functioning kind of like a spaceship that everything people use their needed\nLiving on it for so long well I mean not in terms of\nYou know human evolution but in terms of presents civilization we've been just operating on the presumption that our culture and our economy can grow infinitely just the presumption of infinite gross\nI'm past somewhere and\nWe just keep throwing more more of the same old request\nThat the world of give me more give me more let's grow more or less um growth in consumption are are the answer a seem to be the answer to our prayers so what happens when it seems like you're praying the wrong prayer\nSo if I were to go through the various issues that are confronting people to the side from\nThe fact that it does seem things kind of falling apart just sort of randomly you address parenting romance among grownups women in science evolution climate feral cats bought me fresh local food suicide tenure boat and did I leave out Trump\n[laughter] I Hope [laughter] I Know he's not he's not mentioned by name any resemblance to people living or dead is a pure coincidence\nOh so you're a lawyer told you to say [laughter] I don't want to get those tweets [laughter] [noise]\nNo without giving too much away let's talk let's talk more about the historical aspects of this book [noise] the next door neighbor married treat was very much a a real scientist what lured you to include Mary Treat in the store\nThe twenty first century story these are all characters of my invention living through very real uncertainty however the character's living sort of at that\nPeople so Mary Treat the naturalists who is the next door neighbor who becomes a kind of a larger than life\nFigure she was real she's a real person who I found it fascinating to research she really was the lightning rod for this novel but it took me to violent\nI as I said I was thinking for a couple of years about how to get into this big question about how people behave in times of crisis\nAnd I had chosen\nI knew that I wanted to set it in two different centuries and my historical story around the time of the release of Darwin's two books which just\nPretty much blue everybody's mind not generally in a good way mostly for the worse it was really unsettling powerfully disorienting for people to encounter the proposition that possibly\nHumans were not put here to rule the earth that we actually are part of the year it was really hard for people to accept that in fact it's hard for people to accept that now so I wanted\nI wanted to set the earlier part of the novel in the middle of that that moment when Darwin had released his books\nAnd I wanted to find a champion of Darwin who lived in the U.S [noise]\nAnd I looked I looked at Darwin himself I read a lot about his correspondents in the U. S. I read a lot about a third grade I ran across the name Mary Treat a woman I'd never heard mentioned before she's not very well known I looked a little deeper and discovered\nShe had a really interesting life and she had lived in Vineland this utopian communities and so I went there I read her archive I walked around buying land and discovered that\nWho did a great job the ... um recognize she has this personal correspondence with Charles Darwin\nNobody knows about her she wrote a lot about nature for people who are not scientists a lot of her work was published in the Atlantic monthly and Harper's\nShe was ... she was really interesting woman who could talk to people at every level from Charles Darwin to the ladies botany clubs that she founded in her town so she had this I like to think of as a particularly wall mentally\nCapacity to be accessible to really make her science comprehensible\nYou know what the way into her story reminds me of the story Barbara McClintock roads\nYou know she gets in a Nobel Prize in physiology and yet she wasn't taken seriously for what you do them with genes and corn and all that if you had to stop publishing at one point um so I have a question for you along these lines about how women are\nBoth ignored and the work that they do but also in education how different do you think the American discussion about climate change climate disruption today would be if in fact women overtime had been well integrated into science and technology and such\nWell that's a fascinating theoretical question and I can't really imagine how I Would\nAnswer it and in a scientific way because there's no control group there is no alternate universe where women\nWere allowed to be scientists freely but I think so much about Rachel Carson she's a person I I really admire the first person in the United states to speak to to speak beyond science\nAn amazing document it was a best selling work of nonfiction it was very readable very accessible and the years of its publication and if you look in that book it has chemical formulas in it it hasn't drawings of carbon out of the road and I think they would do this\nThis woman is brilliant woman who had the moxie to say\nYeah I understand science and I think everybody else can understand us too I just have to take the time to respect the leg reader to respect everyday people and and yeah we need more Rachel Carson's\nOrdinary treats are married treat or Barbara McClintock or Barbara Kingsolver\nHe can do it in science do it in a novel and I'm lucky because I was trained as a scientist I ...
