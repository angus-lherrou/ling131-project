[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm a leader John's a sophomore at bart high school early college and a member of the youth form council and it's my pleasure to introduce today's form a conversation on the media's role\nIn today's society in this age of increasing divide in America it can be argued that journalist and the media are facing intense scrutiny almost daily Americans read about the shuttering of newspaper and magazines attacks on the president's credibility\nAnd earlier this year the crews criticism turned fatal when a gunman stormed into the offices of Maryland's capital Gazette killing five journalists\nA few months ago David Folkenflik from NPR addressed the city club and spoke about the importance of journalism he emphasized the role of the media has the role of the media has and the government accountability saying that quote people who value of transparency\nAre going to see problems and government one good press is not an acted in quote\nThe New York times where publishing of anonymous all at authored by a senior official of the Trump administration's further stresses the relationship between the press and the government and although the way we engage with news is changing with the rise of social media freedom of the press remains one of the pillars of the United states a First Amendment rights\nWas diminished joining us today our local experts who will share their thoughts and perspective are panels include Peter Kraus reporter for Cleveland dot coms public interest in Africa C team some of his recent pieces have discussed bell reform in Cuyahoga County

constitutional law at Cleveland State university's department of political science [noise]\nHere to guide our discussion is useful in council member Lauren shepherd learn I turned to form over to you for\nOkay so I think we're going to start off our for what the question of why is being a journalist such an important job of today's society or do you wanna start well\nYou yes first of all thank you for inviting me thanks to all of you\nWhy he's being a journalist so important always not only today well just think of our constitution think of that bill of rights and that First Amendment\nJust that long ago mentioned one single sentence forty five words long and when you see at its height Congress address to Congress shall make no law\nInfringing on their freedom of speech I don't know if the press\nThis is a cornerstone of democracy of a multi party democracy we have\nAttorney why because freedom of press is at the height of democracy weed out the among the press the or their fight for freedom and training that First Amendment\nMight not survive what may freedom of recognition thing off speech which I mention fit in with the press I subject today freedom of assembly of association and freedom of navigation depressed these children ...\n[noise] well yeah I'm a the depresses is as important today as it's always been a for for the reasons Laura mentioned but\nA simply a you'll be the public has a right and the need to know what's going on in society and in particular with its government\nAnd they need to hold their government are accountable for what they do they need to um uh ensure that the government is transparent and what they do\nUm and and you know that's a big thing right now with the with the Trump Administration there's a ... a lot of ah\nUm [noise] a\nA holding the Trump Administration accountable for the things they say and and and and uh\nUh a\nChecking the things that are being said and that's all very very important but I I'll I'll just mention one other thing in terms of of the importance historically Thomas Jefferson and I I'm paraphrasing when I say this but he he wants said that if ah that he would rather have newspapers without a government\nThat a government without newspapers and that speaks to the very foundation of freedom and the press freedom of speech or the ability to a a share information\nKnows what's going on All right\nSo you touched about how with our freedom of the press note or the other First Amendment rights what exists can you do more into that\nWell\nSay to be a journalist [noise] what the press is whether we think of print broadcast or digital media when we think of mainstream media there are three types not only print I repeat there's broadcast meaning radio TV\nThe Internet we know facts the most important aspect of the press you know it's different types of communication if information socks\nOn newspapers and Peter knows more than I Do there's usually a ... section and an opinion section and they should be truly kindly set aside\nSo to know fact is important is key but also do have\nJournalists who practice integrity ... journalists who to practice impartiality because then you should not be confused with opinion I tell my students at Case Western often\nYou're in college now\nSubscribe or read online or in print if you tend to vote for democratic candidate you owe it to yourself to read the wall Street Journal editorial pages editorial pages opinion pages\nThey news hopefully our news I've factual if you are inclined to vote for Republican candidates you owe it to yourself to read the New York\nThose are these agree with you who you tend to trust and we want to trust journalists in communicating effectively by stick to lick effectively I mean factually facts\nNot opinions eat the communicating news if it is in any ... pages of a New York times or the wall Street Journal we know that there was a journal favors Republican perspective\nThe New York times the Democratic perspective\nHopefully they news in those two days I not intermingle intertwined with opinion\nAnd that's a problem that has come up recently recently I Hope you all have a copy of the article from the New Republic\nWhich I for the corporate for owner view because when we speak of fake news by fake news we mean\nLife's not ... nice so fake news inaccurate news I nothing new the article I Hope you have your hands are in the New Republic down says what the New York times I'd known etched\nIn Nineteen Ninety six celebrating one hundred years because New York times was ...\nThey ice published about China about the Soviet Union about Cuba by journalists to where reporters not opinion pieces\nI Hope that that article called bad news coming from the New Republic and trustworthy weekly which is center left\nNational Review or the Weekly Standard I center right I Hope that that article tells you that fake news inaccurate news is nothing new\nProfessor Ron professor on how can we do that\nHow can we be fair given that definition and he said making rigorous distinctions distinguish between fact distinguish between sources know who's Brett Stevens I mean even that example he didn't say that at hybrid\nI did read Stephen jump from the wall Street Journal to New York times making rigorous distinction being fair and\nLetting the your values\nDominate the process of analysis well what I like to act there and I completely immediately because I don't want to take your time Pete is\nA poet I Believe in poetry\nW.
