[noise]\n\nAfternoon and welcome to the city club of Cleveland my name is Paul Harris than I Am a past president of the city close board of directors and a proud city club member\nI'm very pleased to introduce today's speaker the president of the University of Chicago Dr Robert J summer\nOver the last several years the debate over free speech on college and university campuses has become a significant issue facing higher education\nIn two thousand fourteen and now president and co founder of the American College of trustees and alumni\nAddress the city club during the year when a number of high profile speakers found their invitations to deliver a commencement addresses retracted following student outcry\nThe issue certainly hasn't gone away in fact it has moved to the forefront of many college campuses and sometimes violent protests and other disruptions have shut down speeches at Middlebury College or University of California at Berkeley and other colleges\nJust a few weeks ago Case Western Reserve University think for um welcome author and psychologist Jonathan height whose new book written with Greg Lou Cannon off\nOf the foundational by ... his name\nThe trigger warnings and safe spaces spaces and damage to many college campuses Mr I spoke to our community or Cleveland community about the need for colleges just strength training students to be anti fragile in his words\nOf course the controversies around free speech are not limited to college campuses the first amendment was a primary defense of white nationalist protesters that last year so called unite the Right rally in Charlottesville\nAnd the city club continues to play a role in providing a venue for our community to productively engage with voices that some might seek to silence\nI miss this controversy doctors emmer has emerged as a leading voice advocating for freedom of speech and academic freedom on college and university campuses\nDoctors emmer was named the thirteenth president of the University of Chicago in two thousand six prior to his appointment and he served on the faculty and administrator and in the field of mathematics for nearly two decades he earned a bachelor's degree from Brandeis University and his doctorate in mathematics from Harvard University\nIn two thousand Fifteen the University of Chicago released its report of the committee on the free free speech of expression arguing that the quote fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed\nBecause the ideas for fourth of thought by some or even by most members of the university community to be offensive unwise immoral or wrongheaded in quote\nThis report now known as the Chicago statement has been adopted by thirty five colleges and universities in October two thousand Seventeen the New York times published an op ed praising doctors embers efforts and calling them the quote most essential voice in American academia today that's pretty ...\nThe University of Chicago sanitation a former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called the University of Chicago quote the free speech university\nLadies and gentlemen members and friends of the city called the Cleveland Police joining me and welcoming to the stage the president of the University of Chicago Dr Robert Jay Z emmer [noise]\n\nThank you very much for that introduction it is a great pleasure for me to be here at the city club of Cleveland and have the opportunity to speak with you today a city called the Cleveland of course has a a remarkable history and I'm I'm very proud to a now joined that history\nUm my topic today is a free expression open discourse and intellectual challenges on university campuses and their relationship to education\nUniversities and colleges in our nation are at an important juncture in coping with this issue a juncture in which each institution will define what it is what it stands for the nature of its education\nHow old is contributing to the future capabilities of students and collectively what that means for the country\nThis therefore big topic and today I'd like to discuss for aspects of this general subject first one is free expression and open discourse about for universities and why is it important\nSecond what is the actual state of free expression on university campuses third what are the causes of where we are in fourth what can be done about our current situation if as I Do you think something should be done\nSo let me begin with the first topic what is free expression about and why is it important or so of course we're all familiar with the first amendment to the United States Constitution it states in part Congress shall make no laws bridging the freedom of speech\nSo this simple yet profound statement has had an enormous impact in this country it's facilitated in particular much of the important social change that country has seen over the past half century the civil rights movement the women's rights movement the gay rights movement and more\nWherever the first amendment is explicitly about what the government can or cannot do\nAs such public universities effectively government agencies have some First Amendment obligations private colleges and universities however do not the first amendment says nothing about what private institutions can or cannot do with respect to speech\nBut well not about the first amendment university is both private and public do have an obligation not connected to the first amendment but connected to the very mission\nAnd that obligation is to educate students in the most empowering way and give them the capacity and the habits of mind end of action that will enable them to confront the complex challenges that will face in their future\nAt the same time universities in their research mission have an obligation to their faculty to afford them an intellectual and research environment that will enable them to do their most original and impactful work\nAnd that is exactly here in the environment for students education and faculty research that the issue of free expression on university campus\nResearch environment or similar\nSo education is a tool for both personal growth and enhancing student's capacity to face future challenges for student this requires the acquisition of knowledge and their ability to produce or work\nBut critically it also demands the development of habits of mind of ways of thinking about issues and problems that will inform action and be relevant to students for their entire lives\nSo what are the habits of mind and habits of action that students need to develop\nConfronting new and different ideas comfort with questioning others and one's self\nRecognition of one's own assumptions as well as those of others\nUnderstanding the power and the limitations of an argument\nPerceiving the sensuality of contacts culture and history recognizing legitimate competing interests analyzing unintended consequences knowing the difference between a wish and an argument\nUnderstanding the inevitability of complexity and the need in many cases to leave behind the temptation of simplicity exposure to win grappling with unfamiliar modes of increase synthesizing different perspectives\nAnd being able to articulate Lee and coherently advocate a physician\nAll these are skills that students should acquire through their education and the faculty need to impart in delivering at education\nThe single most important ingredients in this formidable task is intellectual challenge this in turn only happens at the highest level in an environment of rigor of questioning and free and open discourse\nOn the other hand the ultimate goal is to produce adults frivolous urging feelings to the extent that a child feels\nHelpful in this regard\nAnd what we're seeing in some cases within high schools and universities is an expectation and then demands for such privilege ing and then the inappropriate acquiescence to such demands\nThere was recently an article in the news about the demand on the part of certain high school students to not have to make in class presentations if it made them feel uncomfortable\nOne high school student was quoted as saying no one should have to do anything that makes them feel uncomfortable\nNow one wants to be forgiving\nBut in truth the statement is both said and completely divorced from reality [noise] but allowing this tone to take hold and fostering acquiescence to this perspective is another problem seeping into high schools and universities\nSo to summarize the section of cause I've described the resistance to free expression because of strongly held moral or political views a misguided approach to dealing with a genuine history of exclusionary behavior\nAnd then excessive privileges of feelings beyond what can produce healthy adults\nSo finally my fourth topic what has to be done about this\nSo four years ago when I pointed the faculty committee that articulated the Chicago principles and then subsequently when I wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal raising the entire issue with free expression\nThere were so much nervousness and discomfort about the issue that in general universities weren't even talking about it or knowledge during that there was a problem\nOver the past four years at least partially in response to the subject\nSigned onto the Chicago principals or crafted their own version of them this may sound significant and it is\nBut given that there are over two thousand four year colleges or universities in this country those expressing strong conviction about free expression and open discourse represents so far only about two percent\nOf course this is much better than when the University of Chicago stood alone in this regard but the silence of the remaining Ninety eight percent is itself a powerful statement as to where we are in silence and the lack of discourse about discourse is a deep problem\nWhat is required is a visible and articulated commitment by both the leadership of universities and the faculty of universities do open discourse in the environment of intellectual challenge that comes with it without clear principles that are articulated\nThere can sometimes be no firmer ground to stand on when dealing with that particular situation\nAnd responses become reactive rather than principal base where at least can easily be seen as such\nTo make progress the issue of open inquiry and intellectual challenge and it's important to the very core of what universities are about\nNeeds to be addressed by those responsible for the long term capacity of universities to fulfill their education and research missions with distinction\nAnd this resides with the faculty and leadership of universities including presidents provost or deans and the board\nBut students of course play a critical role as well and here we see another issue of significance for addressing the issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampuses is ultimately about the quality of education and research environment not the political battles of the day making\nIt primarily about today's politics undermines a commitment to free expression for the long run\nInclusion let me emphasize the stakes\nHigher education has demonstrated over and over again its capacity to change the lifelong opportunities of individuals\nThe trajectory of families and the nature of our society it must continue to do this for reasons both human and societal\nBeing successful demands giving students the tools to confront complex problems challenges Simpsons act with forethought and work with people are very different views and perspectives\nCreating ... sanctuary for comfort is not fulfilling our responsibility is only through an environment the intellectual challenge and the free expression and open discourse that provides this challenge that we're ... filling our obligations ... students ...\nTheir future and the future of our society thank you very much [noise]\n\nToday we're listening to a forum with doctor Robert Jay ... president of the University of Chicago\nWhereabouts are began the audience cue and eight we welcome questions from every one city club members gas students are those are the adjoining us via our live stream if you'd like to ... to question please tweet at at the city club and our staff will try to work it ended up program\nHolding the microphones today are city club marketing and outreach coordinator Julia was wrong\n\nThank you um I enjoy your ... I I'm curious from the point of view of a university president how do you feel that these\nPrinciples of free expression should be enforced on the campus that is what you do about members of the University of community whether their students faculty or others who who would disrupt other people's speech or or ... or shut them down how how's your college is deal with that yes so first\nAre there needs to be clear policies about this you only have clear policies if you know what you're clear principles are so the principals need to translate into policies and the policies need to be discussed widely on campus needs to be talked about\nAnd um everybody needs to understand that uh there are consequences I can give you one very nice example that happened a\nA law school as a matter of fact where they're um there was a protest that the number of law school students wanted to make and they came and wanted\nVery a clear demarcation of exactly what was within the policy and what was not within the policy\nOr they organized a protest that was within the policy and articulated and posted in a very clear statement as an argument as to why this was in university policy so I thought that was a very nice nice example\nMy uh my question is though to asked teachers and leaders and high schools\nTo ah just to reflect on on this question exactly what is that you do so that when people walked in on their first day of college today are prepared\nBe undertaking an environment of uh of significantly more open discourse in electoral challenge and that's that's the job for high school teachers leaders\nAbout\nDr ... thank you for being here in your remarks are very interesting and illuminating\n... there's been ... there have been studies done reflecting that the faculty of the top I don't know many colleges and universities lean hard left\nA are notably Democrats or identify as Democrats or liberals\nAre and that therefore the faculty at these institutions I don't know about Chicago but I Know about a lot of other schools some which I'm familiar with where the faculty are very much leaning left very much taking the Democratic perspective and not withstanding your\nUh identification of issues and prescriptions isn't there a it inevitable risk given this strong tendency on the part of faculty which is where the rubber hits the road with a lot of these issues universities or is it there are of an issue or a\nPossibility that there's an inherent sort of bias in the system that is impacting this process and make that not be another causal agents in this phenomenon that you've discussed\nWell uh yeah so let me say two things about that first I think um you know when you go back\nAnd you look at where I'm\nSort of where the pressures to constrains each been they've not always the line with the political judgments faculty so I think there are there are forces at play other than just sort of where\nWhere the faculty are and so I I Would very much\nIt's too is that a contributing factor or or not and um I Would say that\nWhat it does do if you were in an environment in which are you are a faculty member and you are surrounded by people with a lot of similarity views\nThat it's really incumbent upon you and the group to to actually recognize what it is your assumptions are and how to be teaching in violent them which nose or a set of assumptions sort of a larger way of thinking about that\nI'll just take it out of sort of a concrete uh American political a argument or is to ask well how do you think about\nA\nChinese culture so most people in the United states\nHave a certain view of a kind of fundamental attitude about a citizenship about nation 'em down relation of individual to society and so on it's a it's a western tradition um the history of China's a very different\nA view of that or how do you get people to be able to\nTeach about China to talk about China in a in a way that avoids an intrinsic automatic criticism because there are different and\nSo that's a that's a kind of question I think when you go to that question you see well can you do that I think the answer is yes but you have to be very self conscious about your own assumptions\nWell the to wonder stamped who they are what they were assumptions are and that those in some way needs to be dealt with the way you talk about things\nSo if you're in if you're a Westerner talking about China and you have a very a particular positive view of the of the western tradition bound individual citizen state from someone\nThat doesn't have to be eliminated from a discussion about China\nBut it can't be a injected in such a way that it totally colors and make some possible for somebody to think about China in a way that's different than the way you may think about it so it's a challenge but it's it's it's something one can deal with\n\nThank you many colleges and universities this side of the large a security costs a as a reason for this inviting certain speakers that's a very practical matter is that something that should should not come into play\nUm [noise] I think it should not come into play uh although uh there are some cases in which are ... you have to recognize you know fewer invaded by an army you have to do something different [noise]\nUm I think what is important though is if the security costs really get a on support a ball and it's possible for that to happen or you need to find alternative ways of having people be able to speak so right now everybody has a telephone\nUm\nNot ideal to have to deliver a speech a centrally electronically to an audience um but it's a lot better than being silenced uh so I Would say that\nPair for these kinds of contingencies to keep the uh the costs of a of of security under control they can\n... you know all of that said one needs to recognize that there are extreme circumstances in which um you don't have universities don't have full control of\nTheir environment and um and and that can be a problem on the other hand let me give you another example of how this can be used in a negative way and why am\nHesitant to embrace the whole issue is as you phrased it so I was talking to one university president too and I asked about their views and on the answer I got was my first my first concern is the safety of our students\nAnd I said well I'm\nOf course who care about the safety of your students but if I ask you what is your\nUh\nWhat is your strategy and what does your point of view about the nature of science that should be developed at your university it's important question for universities the answer can be my first concern was laboratory safety\nLaboratory safety is an important thing people can get hurt in the laboratory\nThat's a second order question then the question what is your principal around this now you shut down labs because there are people not dealing with safety and you have to fix them up but it's clear what the principal is the principal is scientific research is important university septic your strategies and you want to do it\nAnd you safety becomes a feature of doing that but that well\nAnd I would say the same thing about the security issue it's not the first issue and it can't be injected as being\nI was wondering how has the environment of free speech fostered at the University of Chicago created success in the classroom and has it lands access to any one particular area of study\nWill what I'd say is uh now I Know there are a number of University of Chicago lungs here so they can either contradict me or support me as a as is always the case for a University of Chicago but I talked to a lot of the lungs\nAnd almost to a person independent of whether they'd gone to the Booth School of business to the divinity school school social services administration or the mathematics department wherever they've gone\nThat this sense of being an extraordinarily challenging intellectual environment and being a kind of crucible for their intellectual development is uniformly felt", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "05"}
