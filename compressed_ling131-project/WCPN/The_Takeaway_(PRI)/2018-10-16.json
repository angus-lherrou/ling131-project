before Congress climate got up to the front ... each other New York times for the first time later that year in the presidential election climate was an issue I'd like to play a clip from a vice presidential debate in which Dan Quayle\nAnd Lloyd Bentsen were asked a question by John Margolis of the Chicago Tribune\nMcGill is a question for senator advancing senator we've all just finished a most America has just finished one of the hottest summers can remember and apparently this year will be the fifth side of the last nine that are among the hottest\nThis problem and that this could in a couple of generations threaten our descendants comfort and health and perhaps even their existence as vice president what would you were a jar government to do to deal with this problem has specifically as a Texan could you support a substantial reduction in the use of fossil fuels which might be necessary down the road\nI think what you can do in ... and which would be very helpful\nAs he was a lot more natural gas which burns a lot cleaner\nBut the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us and we have to look for alternative sources of two and I've supported that very strongly\nOr the greenhouse effect isn't important environmental issue is important for us to get the data and to see what alternatives we might have to the fossil fuels and make sure that we know what we're doing and there are some explorations and things that we can consider in this area\nThe drought highlight of the problem that we have therefore we need to get on with it\nAnd then of George Bush administration you can bet that we will\nQuite interesting so Thirty years ago you went on to become White House press secretary for vice president\nDan Quayle a President Bush did go to the ... summit but Thirty years\nWhat's happened what can I just comment on that that ... yeah that's a fascinating to watch I I actually was one of the small group of folks who prepared Dan for that\nVice presidential briefing and what most people remember from that briefing is the famous Benson line\nYou know I ... about Jack Kennedy did jak India's a friend of mine that's what most people remember from that I write a they remember the JFK line knock the climate right but you look at an answer dance answer in my opinion was better than Lloyd Bentsen in that clip Thirty years ago so think about that\n...\nIt comes to collecting our people are often afraid what they'd like will break the bank it's fine if you ask about him price than in a way out of nearly again you walk away no

world have drugs and die off and wait for hurricane converging on America here's Brett [noise]\nI've interviewed a lot of people are over the years and with audience questions I vividly remember one moment about five years ago when someone stood up with a reporter stood up and said you will suffer from the information deficit delusion\nYou think that one more pod cast one more radio show one more book is going to change people's minds and get them to act people are not acting for a lack of information they're acting for other reasons that we can get into so as a communicator why do you think one more book with a doom and gloom title is going to make a difference\nBecause it's not just one more book with a dumb uncle and title in ... so let me back I Love it I'd had hundreds of arguments just like you have with the information deficit crowd and they're generally write the social salmon I used to work at the national Science Foundation I Know\nHow this works really well and here's the difference what has been missing here's why I wrote this book what has been missing is not that it's a ... book it's stat\nPeople the American public\nAbout things that occur while off in the future they get profoundly uncomfortable talking about what what's happening now because it's much harder so I decided we need to change this narrative this meeting ... and and just laid off or people there are things happening all around the world right now\nThat are causing immense harm and suffering and pain and damages they may not have started to occur in the United states yet\nBut it's only a matter of time before they do so that's what this book does it goes and so it's it's it's not just another doom and gloom book about the future it's it's it lays out in very clear stark terms what is happening right now with water scarcity\nFood insecurity kind of migration 'em and several other factors as you know because people need to recognize these things are happening right now not fifty years in the future we don't have the time to wait because we're seeing significant impacts now that will grow worse and worse and worse starting right now\nAnd you don't think people got that from ... at Harvey you don't think they ... yeah Florence\n... in the moment they do all the polling shows in the moment they do but then it goes away in the moment they do with the hurricane it and then it goes away the cattle farmers in Texas who had to move all of their cattle out of Texas north and the drought\nYeah there's something going on and then then it goes away and the rains come back and then they say oh okay well maybe it's sold out\nSo these things are are are you know so anyway so the point of the book is not it's not really a ... book is to basically so that people need to understand it is here right now the world is at the door right now not fifty years from now one\nReason that I think a lot of intellectual and issue artist books don't get through as they speak to our heads and hearts and there's a moment early in your book where you talk about Terry route than professor at Stanford and she breaks down then [laughter] viewing her tell\nOr so and it's even a yes and and terrorists I mean she is\nFor those who don't know and Terry was married to Stephen Schneider one of the ... the grandfather of the climate movement I'm Terry was the very first scientist to to ask the big question or birds migrating um are they being affected by climate change where they are they changing their pattern so they move you know and she proved conclusively\nUm that they are all birds are migrating differently because of climate change and so that that the that was the first big pivotal study and from there you know lots of other experts she was the co author of the first biodiversity report for the United nations report\nShe she knew the story backwards and forwards and she kept doing study after study after study that really made the case\nThat ... ... ... you know leading to now when we know that half of all I'm species are experiencing local extinctions because of climate change so that's all within her framer in an interview I was just asking or some simple questions about her field and\nShe kept breaking down in our answers then I finally said well you know why you know you know why are you still concern and she basically said I feel like I failed to convince the the public\nAbout what's happening um which is really ... you know tragic because the scientists know they know what's happening they can see it all across the board and so I think she was just expressing what others do end up you know in a very profound and sad way which is\nI just wish the public knew what we know you mentioned your work\nAt the national Science Foundation the climate conversation started kind of in outer space with chemistry and physics in my own journey when ten years of interviews that climate one has gone from chemistry and physics\nTo psychology and sociology and how our human brains are not well suited or wired to perceive slow moving distant\nThreats and that's been formed a lot of communications how to talk to people not\nOf the climate because I think so much is focused on smokestacks entailed pipes and what's between our year\nYeah so I Want to back up just a little bit so whenever whenever you talk to somebody about a potential problem you have to give\nThe problem the solution to the same time and I'm an ... and she would have me for doing this but I'm gonna use my daughter's example she's the currently chief resident in pediatrics um at UC us up children's here in San Francisco and she would be the first to tell you if you're if you're a doctor and you go to the debt side you have to deliver the problem\nThat they're facing and then the treatment plant you do it both the same time and\nMy my argument the reason why I wrote this book is that people need to understand the problem is here right now\nAnd it's demonstrable it's across the board it's having impacts that affect everything from national security to food and you know in security to water scarcity to you name it it's all turned right and that's a very new thing we heard quail\nAnd Ben stern talking about descendants and\nFuture generations and now we are the future generation I mean actually did a survey of water scarcity and predicted that water scarcity would be the greatest threat facing our ... our our planet by twenty twenty five and this was ten years ago when they made that production\nBut to come back so ... so it's not that you present doom and gloom itchy you people need to understand the threat right now and then ... hair that what the solutions and you have to do them both at the same time I'm In in in a way that is credible on both sides of the equation\nThe attack on science is something that's ah been\nGotten a lot of tension you worked at the national Science Foundation we heard you know a Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle kind of defending the science um what's the what's the antidote to that you fight facts with facts again to cognition\nThe facts are confusing there's always a counter fact they are but that yes they are but the antidote so I you know I once wrote a column for for ... for time magazine about this that the the\nFacts on the basis of policy and political decisions you're you're you're always going to be unsafe ground when you waiver from that when you veer off into gut feel an instinct and you you you move away from science evidence and facts you're gonna be in trouble because you're on uncertain ground so that's why\nWhy it's not that debt you want to constantly bombarded people with information\nBut anything that you work on from a big policy um standpoint or ... has to be based on science evidence and facts otherwise you have nothing to base your policy on and that's so\nI think we're almost there honestly with with with climate science we're back to a point where Seventy five to eight you know eighty percent of the ... the American public\nGenerally recognizes that that climate change is a is real and it's a problem it's only twenty five percent of the American public that you know thinks it's a hoax or dismisses that or whatever and that's happens to be the same core of a President Trump's base um\nBut most of the public and and if you look at any major public policy role it's ... I call it the Seventy five twenty five rule when you get to Seventy five percent who generally want to see something done or will allow it you're you're you're almost there then you have to get past the political hurdles over there with climate change and we're back to the media gets at the you know most of the public gets at\nThe ... the remaining hurdle is you know how do you get past the political hurdle and that's a bit that's a different question\nAlliances not Washington save the U.S health care system for our retail providers really just like meeting with the nurse across a card table and a broom closet\nThat's how it in your way next hour at nine o'clock so stick around\nSupport for ... point three W CPS is provided by\nHooking school in early childhood center innovation and fabrication labs and extension center university circle and the upper school academic building open houses this Sunday more in Hoboken dot edu\nYou're listening to climate one Robert Gibbs was White House press secretary for the first two years of the Obama administration's he's currently executive vice president and global\nIts carbon emissions introduces environmental in [noise] well Robert Gibbs welcome to kind of one thank you for having me\nWant to begin with a lead from a recent Forbes article that said millennials don't go to Applebee's they don't have kids and they don't buy homes they do spend astronomical amounts of money on dogs in avocado toast\nAnd they're driving force behind a global shift away from meat so it was America's iconic burger company what are you doing in a\nWorld that's moving away from me\nRight well I mean I think any brand then particularly a food brand has to live a where its customers live and\nTo progress where its customers progress so that could be a whole range of options I Would say uh I don't know the exact figures but by hunch is that uh we sell 'em just about as much chicken now as we do meet a and maybe\nThose examples would consider that all to be sort of part and parcel of the same\nUm but again I think the way you have to look at the world is\nYou're either going to disrupt what you're doing to meet what the mindset of customers is or somebody's going to disrupt it for you uh and it's best for you to be in charge of your own disruption\nOf thinking about sustainability white castle added another of Eagan slider to their menu right nationally they've already selling or the impossible burger plant based burger a Burger King has veggie burgers\nWhen you think about sustainability is the menu on the table at McDonalds [noise] yeah\nAnd if you think um we sell throughout the world who first for people understanding of thirty seven thousand restaurants in a hundred and twenty a different markets and so many of the innovation\nOr in Germany or we will have different types of offerings that some of them are are veggie burgers uh different types of things that appeal to different customers and so I think we're always thinking through and trying to innovate\nOn um on\nWhat will drive customers I think one of the challenges\nAre we've probably candidly had in the U.S is there isn't a huge demand for it and and and if we were\nWe've put stuff like that on the menu here and and not found a huge demand for it maybe that changes again as you mentioned with where maybe they weren't very good allowed veggie burgers aren't very good well right ... ... it is it's a different cooking technique right so I'm\nNot I think I I think as we go along and and as people expand as their taste expand as the demand changes you'll see companies like ours meat that demand a when it's there\nI talked with a sustainability person it at a Harley Davidson at one point and he said we can make electric motorcycles\nBut our brand is so much defined by the roar of that Harley engine right so a quiet Harley [laughter] just doesn't feel or sound like a Harley so is there a brand challenge as a burger company to serving things that are not burgers [noise]\nUm I you know I\nProbably ah probably for all brands there's that challenge I Would say to that uh that person at Harley I'm as a as a proud electric car owner\nUm when you step on the\nPedal if you will I guess it's technically not a gas bill in those cars I'm fellow writer yeah it it's thrill I I don't hear the roar of my car but I I certainly feel it uh and it it it can be a lot of fun I think nobody successful businesses\nWe'd been around for more than sixty years you you're ... if you're standing still and doing the same thing you were doing\nVery different space and so I Do think that\nUh people are going to eat beef I think um I think more people are going to likely eat beef and the question challenge for us as we\nHave goals to decrease our carbon footprint is how do we do that how do we do that at a better way how do we do that in a more efficient way um but I think again who knows what it's hard to picture what five years or ten years looks like um but I don't think anybody can stand still\nOne thing that's coming up is lab meat clean meet there's different names for you basically you know a steak or a burger that doesn't come from a cow it sells grown in the laboratory\nTyson has invested money and beyond meat or Cargill has invested in message Memphis meets these are both lab meat companies that on your radar at all\nWell both those were suppliers of ours um and again I think with customer mindset changing you're always looking out for a for where the market's going to go again I think part of it really depends on how big is the demand for that and I\nI I think many of those as you mentioned are a bit more in their infancy and certainly they they they they will likely grow in popularity and find\nThat customers setting as that happens you'll have more and more people likely come on line but again menu innovation what people want and where they're going to get it is is if it wasn't on our mind we wouldn't we wouldn't be here for sixty years\nWhat are the real drivers for sustainability is that shareholders customers brand what's really driving sustainability\nAt McDonald's to me I think I think it's probably all of those things um I think I think customers are demanding more responsibility from the companies that they themselves want to be associated her to do business with I think\n... to a investors and shareholders as you said have a greater interest in the responsibility that a corporation hands and I think we also believe\nBecause of our size and our scale that we have both the ability and that responsibility to use it for good\nOr and so I think there's right now a bit of a synergy with all of that um and I would say to you know because we're a food company where food is grown how it's grown whether it can be grown\nIs central to our business and so we were just at an event talking about coffee farming and\nYou know you can't just do that anywhere you have to do that in very specific places it very specific altitudes his changing fright and as the climate changes as the biosphere changes\nThat's going to it's going to put real pressure on a group of people that are growing coffee for a living a group of people that are buying coffee and for coffee drinkers and so\nIn some ways you think to yourself or this is nice and it feels good and it sounds good but there is also part of it that if you don't get this right\nIt can really impact your business we can't sell a fish sandwich in thirty seven thousand restaurants without\nGuaranteeing a supply chain that sustainable if you can't you won't do that long a and the same is true for coffee which is why our goal is to have a hundred serve a hundred percent sustainable coffee in our restaurants by twenty twenty if we can't do that\nThen we won't sell coffee for law and that will be a big big impact\nI'm a he's now global chief communications officer at McDonalds this climate one I'm Greg Dalton\nThe carbon disclosure project ranks and grades companies on various parts of their commitments and twenty Seventeen they gave McDonalds as sea on climate\nB minus on water and to be on for us for thoughts on that you know you're not deeply involved in in the carbon accounting but that you're doing pretty well on forests climate and the average\nInstead of the year that was twenty seven ... it probably doesn't again take into account the big step that we did this year in in March in announcing the verified science based target huh around ... one of the first food companies yeah and the only restaurant company so I you know I I\nI think that's a big step change for us forests are hugely important um are packaging and recycling are our goals around making sure that we're using
