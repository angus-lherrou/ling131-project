sheriff held as his favorability rating among young people ten points lower and governor assets\nYounger voters are important for Democrats to win in any state and one third of eligible Latino voters in Texas are ages Eighteen to twenty nine to act a large portion of Latino voters in a state where the Latino vote these heat [noise]\nBut here we are out of college where nearly half of the students are Latinos and letting us and\nNone of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for ... days particularly from young voters the first problem to share of has his name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into ... as a candidate\n\nThe Democratic primary jolt tax is a political mobilization group for young Latinos\nDidn't endorse the sheriff endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas [noise] they pointed out that during her tenure Cher sell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding immigrants in her jail cells when

documented immigrant\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progress is want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nI wanted to go that place but I don't have that power this is a federal issue that the governor or when you know I wouldn't just make a statement I take action\nAction can be taken in this before\nIt's before is cruel bill and is affecting the undocumented that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called as before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear I read your broadcast the moment you know Facebook Live video has a son in law liberal than sanctuary cities in the law essentially forces look\nEnsures that law enforcement officers and can and will cooperate with\nSure if this opposes the law and has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign she also supports allowing

we want to protect our country\nMm\nAnd so maybe some Republicans might like strong borders national security rhetoric maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm offend young Democrats by winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days\nWhen we were in Odessa we met a Republican voter out the Mexican restaurant who told us\nTo create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence and use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas\nAnd said I did this in valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns besides the\nOh your dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward with road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have really benefited from this is Kris Kobach\nSo if you think now about you know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump in the White House and directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration you know I I\nThink that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing it's hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes then\n[noise]\nI think that it is a sign
