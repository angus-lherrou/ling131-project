seeing it as an economic opportunity and in particular trying to think about how do we create jobs for low income African American and Latino families that are poor and working class like the ones who live in South central Los Angeles\nAnd at that time it was billions of dollars that were being invested coming down the pipe and so we were doing our research we figured out that the top polluters at that time or our buildings and if you're familiar with LA infrastructure we have a pretty old infrastructure [laughter]\nAnd so we saw this as a great opportunity to create good paying unionized jobs

guests are ... law firm overlook international foundation Gina McCarthy former head of the EPA under President Obama to climate author and activist Bill McKibben the investor an advocate Tom Sawyer in Gloria Walton in environmental justice leader in Los Angeles [noise]\nGina McCarthy the term green\nJobs is often used to sort of cell ... tell us what you think about that term green jobs and how it might reflect difficulty connecting with certain parts of the country what's imbedded in that term\nI really I I don't know what a green job is every job ought to be green I think you know\nBut that is Mimi\nCan grow much stronger economy and it creates jobs that the jobs that you want to have\nNow if that's what you want to call green that's fine but when you say green job it sounds a lead us it sounds like it's not open to everybody I'm it sounds like it's a funky little thing where you take people for hikes or something\nSo I'm not a big fan of of of articulating green versus everything else I think I Want to make sure that we mainstream these ideas I'm extraordinarily concern that climate has become so POTUS and that it's not it's not talked about among families\nYou know you're in I think we have to get over these ideas that there is\nYou know a a green world and then everything else you know I just think we need to get together figure out how the jobs of the future of the ones that create a sustainable healthy unjust war all those are the jobs that are green to me I don't care what what you want to say\nTom Sawyer driven organization active on college campuses around the country red states how do you message and try to connect with people you're a San Francisco liberal how do you connect with people in other parts of the country who don't want to talk or you know think San Francisco liberalism people at\nOur organization is on\nFour hundred and Twenty one college campuses this year and we talk to people young people under thirty five\nAbout the issues that they're most concerned about which pretty much across the country involve the cost of higher education which is a a a killer issue that people don't really recognize healthcare is a killer issue\nRacial justice across the country people under thirty five are very very concerned with climate me environment\nAnd that's pretty much any place you go and what I think about American politics today on this\nI'm voted half the rate of other American citizens and it's not that they're not informed and passionate and we're lazy they have an issue and the issue is they don't think that the system responds to their needs and they don't think either party tells the truth\nWhen we're talking about energy and climate we're talking about something that they absolutely no in their bones has a huge justice element to it\nThey know that it's an issue that if people are talking about pushing it out and not caring they know it will affect them\nAnd it's an issue where that entire generation doesn't want to see the swept under the rug they know that it's one of the issues where the older people in America want to basically pass a gigantic debt onto them encourage a huge debt and pass it on to their generation and let them deal with it\nSo actually I don't think there is any kind of regional\nIssue in terms of youth in the United states of America I think that when we go to red states\nWhen we talk to young people there\nThey are absolutely on the same wavelength which they are sick and tired of people lying to them and they're sick and tired of people hiding the truth\nAnd I think when you get into an honest dialogue Americans are much more similar across party lines across geographical lines than people generally knowing that they tend to be very compassionate very brave and very ready to act\nOr wealth and tell us about Taylor Mayfield I don't know how how old Taylor Mayfield there's but there's a story there about him trying to get into a union where there were some obstacles for him\nYeah this is about our green jobs program that we actually launched back into thousands sex and and the entree plant was really ... and so that meant that we were going to retrofit city owned buildings we thought as an entree plant for\nA maybe he can be kind of like my father he kind of is like a father to me really so we invited the building trades or an international Brotherhood of electrical workers in particular to a community meeting\nWe passed the house standing room only and Mr may feel you know we're having like a pretty good conversation and some dialogue about what's possible and the job that can be created and a Mr Mayfield stands up and he looks this representatives and the eye and he's just like\nI Know you mean well but black folks are locked out of the building trades so why should we work with you\nIt was silent just kind of how this room is right now [laughter]\nAnd I was even shocked 'cause you know you always try to have a few leaders perhaps in the in the room right to kind of access provocative questions but this was something that just came from his heart and that was real that we actually need it to address and it was our members who helped us create a program that\nPaid an apprenticeship opportunity it had a cohort model a labor unions actually provided bus tokens for people to get to work um because you know a lot of people have been under an unemployed for years and don't have transportation [noise]\nUm we were really creative with ways for people actually get all of their hours though if you couldn't pass some of the test then you would actually get trained for several more hours\nAnd so the point was to guarantee your success in the program and to make sure that you actually replaced and a good paying unionized job that provides benefits so that you can actually support your family and so some of our members got access to those jobs\nA Mr Mayfield 'em and many others and then we actually expanded on that Minnesota retrofit programs to do residential retrofit I'm with the campaign that we called\nGoing on today we're\nTalking about climate climate when I'm Greg dolls are my guests are ... from the over like international foundation Gina McCarthy former head of the EPA under President Obama the climate author and activist Bill McKibben the investor and advocate Tom Steyer and Gloria Walton and environmental justice leader in Los Angeles\nBill McKibben one of the big debates that goes on\nIn environmentalism is trying to bridge individual change and systemic change and there's quite a debate about people want to say I want to do an action that matters um so what kind of individual action matters and how can that be connected you know rise up to collective systemic change\nThat [noise] you know I think the early days of the climate discussion real lot about individual action what am I going to do what my kind of light bulbs do I have one of my driving so on and so forth fine [noise]\nAnd if the physics and chemistry of climate were such that we had fifty or a hundred years to deal with the problem probably a perfectly sound way to go about things you know humans in their societies really do change best when they change somewhat slowly and people have a little time to adapt and so on and so forth but\nIt physics is ... you know calling the tune here\nAnd it's very clear that we not only don't have fifty years we had to start fifty years ago and we didn't and that means at this point that you can't make the math work one household at a time one lightbulb at a time I'm that's why\nMhm [noise]\nAnd then that's living on earth listening isn't just from one generation to the next\nPer individuality as a compound in and of other creatures DNA that has come to us by horizontal gene transfer come into a sideways coming to us by infection\nI asked him and that next time I ... the\nHead of your way tomorrow night at eight o'clock here on the boys three

of the EPA under President Obama the climate author and activist Bill McKibben the investor\nWith our lightning round I have some true or false questions for our guests are beginning with Tom ... falls you made a lot of money off Canadian tar sands and Indonesian for us\nI Will say this I Know we made money off fossil fuels\nAnd I don't specifically remember some of that but we invested in every part of the economy and starting in two thousand eight I came to the conclusion that was wrong and so I've been to vested for years and I decided in fact we can't afford to have those kinds of activities and so I don't [noise]\nLittle longer than profiles a fair enough um I don't like this game [laughter]\nYou know I mean we really do McCarthy shoot far off [laughter]\nYou were having\nDifficulty figuring out how academia works yes [laughter]\nThank God that was easy [noise]\nMaybe this also for Gina McCarthy true or false you are personally sick and tired of hearing about polar bears yes [laughter]\nI Love them they're cute but they're not my grandson [noise]\nTrue or false gory Walton you sometimes don't talk about climate concerns because you think people don't want to hear the doom and gloom follow us\n[laughter] I mean to me it's like I talk about what's real and what needs to be said in the mail\nBill McKibben true or false villain as Aisha and could be the downfall of the climate movement\nI think of just the opposite uh the the moments that people started to the moment that people started to understand that there was some someone that needed fighting was the moment that it turned serious and got real that's why\nMarch role indigenous people mostly from North America but from around the world you don't think you don't think they get that there's like a villain in I mean you know ... exactly how much American history do you need to kind of\n[laughter] figure that out you know [noise] um so\n... and builds a critic getting\n[laughter]\nA little noise a turtle calls carbon offsets inhabit a shady and murky world\nThat is true and that's exactly why cool the fact was created\nGina McCarthy true or false President Obama could have got a carbon price through Congress in two thousand nine if David Axelrod and rama ... had encouraged him to try\nHarder ... that's a very good question I don't\nThink so also for gene I'm a [noise]\n'cause like\nTrue or false coal state Democrats blocks the Clinton Gore administration from putting a price on carbon\nIn Nineteen Ninety four and the form of a BTU tax I Believe that's true west Virginia and\nTom Sawyer true or false corporations wheeled way too much influence over our democracy no question about it [noise] um that's a tough one [laughter]\n... that's a basic fact of American democracy and politic well they are people you know write\nA ... polar bears are amazing iconic creatures that evoke strong positive emotions among many Americans\nI'm going to go with ... sauce because I think people are sick of seeing polar bears and I think they're sick of the doom and gloom around climate I think what they want is a need to understand that their actions that they can take that there is a message of hope out there than in any case\nAnd then Tom Steyer is running for office he just can't decide which one [laughter]\n\nWhy are you asking me [laughter]\nHe might have told you [laughter] 'cause I Know if I ask you remember that show the let's give them around forget [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n... question from Facebook or Don how can you please speak to your vision of the world we want in addition to what we don't what would a truly post carbon just sustainable\nAnd resilient society look like Bill McKibben let's have you paint that picture and I want to preface this by saying I remember one of your books I think it was deeply economy that said one of the primary accomplishments of American economy recently was building bigger houses further apart from each other [laughter]\nUm so tell us what the future picture look like\nI think one of the things that we've gotten very hung up on is the idea that humans mostly want is more stuff when probably past a certain point where we want is communities that work in connection with each other\nAnd I will say well where do I know which unpopular on this\nStage in a sense politically incorrect let me say a word to for polar bears and other wildlife you know [laughter]\nIt'd be nice\nTo imagine a world where um the Flora and fauna that we were born on to this planet with had some room to um you know the human being involved in contact with each other and in contact with the world around us and one of the things that's sad\nWith the world around them you know when you when you I mean in California when we let people put\nOil wells next to people's schools and how is this what's the chance that you're going to be you know playing outside when you're a kid you know what I mean that takes that off the map\nSo keeping that in mind instead of doing what we've done for the last hundred years which is an answer every single question\nThrough the the only thing we've asked is will this make the economy larger or not and in the process we build an extraordinarily large economy almost all of which is owned by one percent of the people and in in the process we wrecked the planet around us and the communities on it [noise] so let's ask [noise]\nNew more interesting questions I guess I'd say\nFair enough a Tom style what is the key points of the the climate summit the Jerry Brown put together in San Francisco was having corporations make specific targets people are looking to corporations in the absence of federal action\nYour take on that as that green washing our corporations really doing moving the economy all these announcements science based targets is that real action moving toward a cleaner economy\nI Do think it's real\nBut I don't think it's nearly sufficient and let me draw a comparison to American history you know after in the beginning of World War two\nThe president Franklin Roosevelt called in the auto companies and said you know we're just not prepared for this war and I've got to ask you that you're going to have to dedicate a lot of your manufacturing to making tanks and ships and airplanes so that we can fight the ...\nAnd they came back after a weekend and said you know we're more than willing to go we think we'd twenty percent of our production can be dedicated to the war effort and that's something we'd like to do and he said well let me explain to you what I'd like you to do\nAbout what this society has to do to represent the values that we need the bill's talking about Mars is talking about the gene is talking about the glories talking about we have to have the courage to stand up for the values that are the basis of this society\nAnd that means we're gonna have to go to the people\nThemselves and their elected representatives to determine what those values are not to the\nControllers of the large corporations to ask them to give us some crumbs and I'm not those are meaningful and those are not people who I Would vilify I Would say look I Am not counting on them\nTo put us ahead of their shareholders and their bottom line I'm looking to the American people and the will and values of the American people with a broad
