Puerto Rico she says operation bootstrap transformed Puerto Rico from a largely agrarian economy to one based on manufacturing and tourism they did that with a patchwork of government tax incentives and access to us markets\nThe farming that remained was not in the household level but in a larger industrial scale\nNow suddenly it's about making money so therefore you need to grow things like sugar and coffee and that's great but those are not things that people can eat\nAnd the food that is imported to Puerto Rico is on average twenty percent more expensive than in the U.S [noise] that can be attributed at least in part to the Jones Act of Nineteen twenty which says any item imported to Puerto Rico must be carried on a U.S vessel [noise]\nSo if Puerto Rico wants to import let's say tomatoes from its neighbor the Dominican Republic those tomatoes must first go to the U.S mainland whether it's a hundred miles away [noise] they get put on a U.S boat and then traveled back the same eight hundred plus miles to Puerto Rico so\nIt's both makes the food more expensive and less nutritious by the time it gets here it's been on a boat for much longer than it has to be it just creates a much longer time line\nIn the last forty years because of discoveries from genome sequencing a kind of evidence that Darwin and most biologist in the twentieth century didn't have and those challenges have been astonishing counter intuitive and have reshaped what we thought we knew about the history of life on earth\nTo summarize I think it's fair to say a big takeaway here is that what we think of as species what we think of as individuals and for that matter the whole tree of life where evolution show species neatly diverge from its origins well it's not exactly right why is that that's putting it politely\nSay at the end of the book after having told these stories of these people in their discoveries that this whole ...\nIndividual and the idea of the tree of life the idea of a species that it's a unitary thing it's a population of creatures that are similar to one another and they injure breed with one another and only with one another [noise]\nThe idea of an individual there is an individual named Rufus the brown dogs there is an individual named Charles Robert Darwin there's an individual Steve Kerr would David Quammen\nAnd we are a unitary in discreet and thirdly the tree of life represents the history of life on earth that is a tree shaped history and it turns out that all three of those ideas this categorical are wrong in important ways\nYou know it's tough for a moment yours is a story of people a scientist trying to understand life and how it has the bald how it continues to evolve tell me about some of the characters in your story especially car was\nMm yes so I came across this so early on in my own discovery of this subject Karl Rove and microbiology at the University of Illinois who came out of nowhere and suddenly in November third Nineteen Seventy seven\nAppeared on the front page of the New York times above the fold\nPicture of him and a story about his discovery of any third kingdom of life on earth the separate form of life that was unknown to exist before that\nBefore that we thought they were basically two kinds of life bacteria and everything else bacteria were simple cells everything else was composed of complex cells would sell nuclei animals plants fun guy humans and wolves came along and said no wait a minute I've discovered a third form\nAnd that was the beginning of a sequence of discoveries that he essentially triggered that have led to this new understanding\nAnd by the way what was that he discovered what was\nArchaea archaea as in archaeology suggesting old because it was thought that they were the oldest form of life on earth maybe\nThese were creatures that had been taken for bacteria for decades and decades ever since people started looking microbes through microscopes they thought that these things were bacteria\nWas started sequencing their genomes and lo and behold he said no these things are not bacteria if you look at their genomes are not only distinct from bacteria but they're more similar to us to humans to all animals plants than they are to bacteria\nThey are radically distinct and so he announced in a scientific paper and the press announced in headlines that he had discovered a separate form of life a third major kingdom\nNow by the way about this kingdom the car was discovered these are pretty tough characters are aren't they they're they're they're in hot spots very extreme temperatures that sort of thing\nThese creatures the archaea at first they seem to live entirely in extreme environments as you said a hot springs in Yellowstone Park thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean highly acidic environments more and more as scientists discovered ways to sequence DNA just out of the wild\nThey have discovered these creatures live in a lot of different environments not all of which are extreme but one of the groups of extremity loving our kids\nLive near events at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean almost ten thousand feet down between Norway and Iceland\nAnd those are ... are called low key archaea and it's now thought that they in fact are the descendants of our original ancestors that we all complex\nAn event at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean than having come from anywhere else but those are how to put it there are the descendants of our ultimate ancestors that we come from archaea and not from say the bacterial side of the tree of life\nThen raises the question maybe they came from someplace else because if they're really tough ... they might have survived interstellar space\nYou know that's why NASA funded car was this work his original funder when he discovered the archaea one of his funders was\nThe national aeronautics in space administration why because they thought that his work might shed light on the problem of XO biology the\nPossibility of the existence of life on other planets other star systems other places around the universe\nTell me a bit more about Carl was the man\nWas a biophysicist he was trained to at Amherst and then at Yale in ... physics that was his PHD and then he went to work for the general electric labs in Schenectady New York\nThey hired him as a research molecular biologist and he really had no idea what they wanted him to be doing he sat in a lab in Schenectady for a few years ... around\nAnd trying to make some important discoveries he was always interested in pure science in the deep questions what is the shape of the early history of life and the history of life since then\nEventually he was hired away to the University of Illinois where he could be a cranky crunch the professors that didn't spend much time with undergraduates he was a terrible lecture he was reclusive he didn't participate in faculty committees he was just this brilliant grouch\nWho could be wonderful to students could be a fine generous mentor but could also be this total\nAs a character is the central character the book the other thing that attracted me it was and\nQuickly saw that he's probably the most important biologist up the twentieth century that nobody has ever heard of so\nOne could say that convergence is a major theme of your book and of course than the Darwinian tradition or wear jeans past vertically from parents offspring we'd draw trees to represent this movements in the limbs on a tree only diverge from other branches but David if the tree of life is not actually a tree\nHow might we best described evolution based on what you've researched and written about here\nWell some people say we should think of a Web and not a tree of life because as you say convergence is very very important a network of life one fellow suggested the circle of life\nAnd yet the tree is still mostly right it captures some big patterns\nBut there are exceptions to those patterns the tree image was valuable to Darwin and the people who followed him because it represented the divergence that has occurred\nThrough the history of life one lineage diverge ing and to lineages one limb into two branches et cetera and species diverge from one another all of this divergence that led to the diversity of life that we see on earth now\nBut it's not just a matter of divergence the discoveries that flowed from from what was his work and his methodology including things like the prevalence of a phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer genes moving sideways across boundaries\nThose represented convergence and so the real history of life is a history of lots and lots of divergence complicated by a lesser but very significant amount of convergence genes moving sideways branches of life coming back\nPlease describe this phenomenon for us and and how revolutionary discovery it was\nRight well when I first came across this probably back in two thousand thirteenth man I had written three maybe four books about evolution before that and I had never heard of horizontal gene transfer\nSo suddenly I came across it in reading some scientific article or a blog or something in two thousand Thirteen and my first reaction was what what what that is impossible that's just not supposed to happen\nI mean yes if you have two very similar species closely related then sometimes individuals mate and hybrids are born and occasionally those hybrids or even fertile\nSo that too closely related species may overlap and connect a bit but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about genes moving across\nBroader gaps from one unrelated species of life into another horizontally", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "city":
