foundation we have we have never face a hurricane up the man you did but we have been through several other so we have some institutional experiences\nOr experience so we live in a couple of things uh one uh\nSeveral uh foundations in Puerto Rico basically said go to lower our Web page\nUh and then we'll see uh\nWe we know from ... from very one that that was in a very liberal at all in my house

basically\n... in a in a in a horse so [laughter] it's really in a horse and I'm Still we recorded Boy Scouts were because that yeah well we recruited Boy Scouts or because these are the young people noticed them all\nTo deal with that kind of situation\nSo I'm senior Boy Scouts we recorded two of them they went out and they became ... back and forth notably I saw the FBI were they just connecting or have a non profit organizations and so on so using that match that person to person\nUh gardening whatever ... horses or whatever I a unique to get there were able to collect information we're able to ... to to to deliberate water purely fires were able to get in contact with a joke but people\nAnd we were able to start working around an ocean of solar panels so very simple ...\nBack by by the
