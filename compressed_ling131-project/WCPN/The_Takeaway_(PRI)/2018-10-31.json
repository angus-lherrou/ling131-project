[noise]\nFrom the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston this is living on Earth I'm Steve her with a major study published in the journal of the American Medical Association has found what many people have long suspected eating organic food appears to reduce the risk of cancer\nAmong some sixty nine thousand people tracked by French scientist over several years those whose diets contained more organics had about twenty five percent fewer cancers overall with thirty five percent fewer breast cancers and older women and the more than Seventy percent reduction in the form of us\nDo studies suggest but does not prove that pesticides and other chemical residues in foods cause cancer but there's no reason to wait for more research when it comes to making food choices advocates say including the president of the environmental working group can cook Ken welcome back to living on earth thanks Davis great to be here\nSo when this study came out that showed strong evidence in support of the long held beliefs that organic food is better for us how do you feel now that the study is out there\nYou know I guess I feel as if we should have been doing studies like this a long time ago we really do need to be much more careful about the low levels of carcinogens that we still have in our diet the fact that several cancers here\nDid show or a market decrease to me tells me the organic food is probably targeting the mechanisms that are associated with those cancers and the other thing that's interesting while they speculated about\nGo dies a certain color rings a certain flavorings that simply are not allowed in organic food manufacturers that in addition to pesticides may be another reason why there's lower cancer rates amongst these mostly women who are eating more organic food\nAnd of course if the product is made from genetically modified organisms it's not allowed to be labeled as organic\nThat is true as well and there really are not very many chemicals that are allowed in organic manufactured or packaged food\nCompared to conventional where there are thousands so there are lots of questions raised by this study but to me it goes back to the basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives less processing is probably in general playing a role here\nSo how excited are you by this study and how much of the game changer do you think it might become\nWell I find it very encouraging it's just one study that's often said from time to time and the right one study is just one study\nTo me this opens the door to doing more types of analyses like this big populations\nAnd refining even further what we know about the diet of the people that are are responding to the questions what we need to do now Steve is we need to scale it up we're still talking about organic with a\nA very small footprint on the agricultural landscape and unfortunately still a very small footprint as it were in our diet but the other thing I I just have to say is you know this\nDoes not mean that eating conventional fruits and vegetables is a bad thing we think that's positive the real problem we we have in our diet is the processed food the the additives but this study adds that extra twist\nSome people are going to be surprised that you say go ahead to eat conventional fruits and vegetables that has pesticides on them because they're less of a risk than other things that we\nFor Ninety point three W CPS is provided by the Cleveland hearing and speech center announcing the grand opening

they don't have the two women and three other so called vowels Turner's temporarily stop the flow most of the oil coming from Canada's tar sands that day\nA protester who acted in North Dakota spent months in prison at the pair who acted Minnesota also face felony charges ms Johnston an editor and poet and miss collapsing retired attorney were charged with damaging the Enbridge pipelines unprepared to mount a climate necessity defense\nBut October night in the middle of the trial of Minnesota judge abruptly acquitted them of all charges and they joined me now from Seattle, Washington welcome to living on earth thank you thank you very much need how does it feel to have these felony charges thrown out\nOn that I think we all have mixed feelings about\nQuite frankly that I'm off bail and may have the opportunity to do civil disobedience again because I had to be very careful while out on bail because if I got arrested it could be revoked and I could spend all of my time in the Clearwater county jail awaiting trial\nBut um you know we're disappointed that we did not get to put on the climate necessity defense that we wanted to with you know the very well respected experts that we had lined up to testify for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from Nassau\nAnd Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag Emily\nYeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was to sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony on climate change and on civil disobedience you know it would've been the dream trial it could have made a really big difference so the thought that this kind of trial might happen in that courtroom in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really\nHave an impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to me and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it's it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as one of the time that you heard a booth charged to look you use the necessity\nAnd he had granted that to us back in October of twenty Seventeen and in fact he had copies of our expert witness list for a for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have\nConstrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that and he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with stunning at the lawyers who couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised until that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seemed like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that\nIt's the prosecution that has the burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did you know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves and to prevent the greater harm of climate change\nWe did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability to defend ourselves essentially because who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle\nOn climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter how articulate we had been it wouldn't have had anything like the same impact\nAs the former head of the NASA Goddard Space Center talking about climate change and how urgent it is or about Minnesota scientists talking about how urgent it is and how much is already changing in Minnesota so you know again uh we had no ability to defend ourselves without experts to testify to those things\nAnd the software engineering or go to some was\nThat was ... a young father of three who was our support person or support people were all arrested\nThey went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope when we're planning the action that they would not be arrested so we're very very happy that he's acquitted and home with his young\nFamily were happy that he's acquitted but I personally am very sorry he didn't get to testify you know in the necessity defense hearing a in August a year ago when he testified there was not a dry in the room\nYou know when he talked about his young children and what they were facing\nAnd then the case becomes even more confusing I guess because the judge shows in the one hand you can have witness was to make your case and then he proceeds to go ahead to acquit you of the charges\nThat was after the prosecutor had presented his case which was only two witnesses the sheriff who arrested us and and local Enbridge employee and all he proved was that we had broken some chains that were holding the log into\nUnder a statute which was one of the sort of enhance penalties statutes that are being shoved through state legislatures right now by the fossil fuel industry to give them you know further penalties against protesters\nAnd the statute we were charged under was specifically damage to pipeline and the judge ruled and he was correct that the prosecutor had not prove that we had damaged the pipeline and anyway\nYeah and ... who is essential he wasn't really that there wasn't evidence for a reasonable jury to convict us basic right a as a matter of law then that was because of course we hadn't damage that pipeline right\nI'm going to ask you to speculate about both of you in a ... about judge Robert Tiffany and the decisions that you made in your case how do you think the judiciary might have been influenced by outside forces politics to move the fossil fuel industry\nThis is Emily in terms of you know what kind of pressures he may have been under or what he may have been I'm thinking you know whether his mind might have changed about what kind of precedent he wanted to set and so forth you know it's it's impossible to know and and it's you know distressing and it certainly something we've been wondering about\nHe seems like a very reasonable guy he gave us a necessity defense he wanted to hear what we had to say and he wanted to let the jury hear it so you know the about face was quite extreme\nWe know for sure that Enbridge provided something like two thirds of the budget that county so I you know they obviously have some influence direct or indirect we don't know I mean we have no way to know what may or may not have happened behind the scenes but\nThe fossil fuel companies have terrible amounts of influence and power in this country and you know that's why we have to fight them and the ways that we have to fight them because they do own and control our political system all on all levels\nTo what extent did you understand\nSo that that was not only a possibility but a strong probability and we accept that risk\nI personally feel I'm sixty six years old and I feel that it is my job as an elder and it is my job because I Am an old white woman who has the privilege of not having the cop show up and shoot me on site if I Do something like that\nThat it really is my job to step up and do these kinds of things I Know from my you know young activist of color friends that it's far more risky for them\nIt's far more risky just with the police showing up that you know they can be in danger of their lives and we know that the criminal justice system is far more likely to treat them harshly\nWe can look right now what is going on with the prosecutions of indigenous folks who stood up at Standing Rock\nAnd often were arrested for no more than standing in prayer and yet or getting felony convictions right now and getting very harsh
