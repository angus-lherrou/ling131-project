the truth is is that\nYou're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or

never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never organized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents have natural organizers they were so good at building community\nI went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester but I didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the houses of the kinds of people that I went to school in and my dad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards actually the end of his life and so my mom would invite the cashiers from the locals Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\nGot fifty throw into top because those are the people that are family could relate to\nThey were always about leaning in to people and the politics comes back in\nAnd that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs my number one job is to care about people and to lean into them show them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nAnd then we talk about the politics\nWhat is your puppy

data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter] absolutely\nI think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort and basing some of the things I talk about um real facts and figures\nFull story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ... that particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing was about ten years ago to see the terrific show in heights\nLike Washington Heights ... day you wake up and I got this little plug\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about and it's a Broadway musical by minimum or ...\nI mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to also\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community\nAnd actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about ... thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself\nI wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans and was going to New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nA little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the youth policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised you are working in New York City schools and in your policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of\nWhich lunar issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities\nBoth in ways that make them great and the ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but let's see no non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find\nIs that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really provides to lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nIn comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans both in New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in pairs of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and the costs going culture may not be as\nTechnical thing but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller\nBite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and like the United\nStates increasingly I think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis and now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strength and different communities\nAnd we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently on the United states census\nBureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work there's a question about race and then there's the next question about it and the city so when race people are largely answering whether they considered themselves white black or an Asian background or other", "year": "2018",
