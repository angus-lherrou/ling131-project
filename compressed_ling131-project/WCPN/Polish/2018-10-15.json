Pennsylvania\nYes so that was that was some experience talked about down the hill\nOr if it really was it's it's amazing how the accuracy of the replica a it's a national shrine or the the beautiful black and silver alter that we know of course of the uh the monastery just over\n... you think you were in the same the same like the same alter uh it's it's perfect and of course\nThey do the unveiling unveiling\nSaid that by some experience as a ... what was that a lot ... than most\nWell it's very historic um\nI guess even going back to\nThe original a painting which tradition tells us was done by St John\nActually on a table or in the house of the holy family yes and of course through the ages it uh it ended up in ... St Helena the mother emperor Constantine uh brought it to him\nThat moved into a a part of Russia which is polling today\nUm St lettuce love I Believe had it for a period of time\nAnd uh the powers are the people believe with the lady just over are fascinating from uh the monasteries standing through the invasion of the Swedes the Russians\nThe ... the ah the Germans and the sweets sweets sweets yeah factor and the sites where you know the uh the painting itself which I Believe is on wood\nAnd we we called the black but down but really it's been through the ages the pigmentation or the pain has just gotten darker course for centuries it was just slipped by candles and so the smoke yes uh also uh adjusted color pigmentation but there are two scars on the face of the ladies just a ...\nWhich are were done by a source when when the when the who cites a invaded\nA the a soldier then went to destroy the uh the image and a broke down and couldn't do it a ... people have tried to steal it out of the monastery and the horses wouldn't move\nHave a a Porsche priest father Michael is risky or from the Pauline\nOrder of course in the same as the monster and yesterday or I Would say me how is ... ... well that you say it's better than I Do certainly um he arrives in American soil and for three years he's working throughout the United states and Canada\nUm any begins to see a need among uploaded to strengthen and revive the polish spirit and pride and as well as the need to show really the true richest as a force culture and father Michael's dreams to build a shrine\nWhich will become both religious and cultural center so in Nineteen fifty three the pollen or received permission from the Holy See to establish a monastery in indoors Tom Pennsylvania\nUh they then of course were also allowed to open a retreat house in the chapel so they buy forty acres of farmland I'm\nOn a hill and ah\nThere's a there's a farmhouse in a barn in the first chapel was in the barn a and of course it stayed that way a until just thousands and thousands of pilgrims just as they do in just over\nBegan tracking to do as Tom Pennsylvania to see the uh the lady of the American lady of just over\nA the barn became too small to handle the crowds\nAnd uh then in the\nEarly Nineteen sixties they decided they really need to build what we see today is a true shrine\nAnd ah they wanted to time it with the uh\nThe whole Poland's millennia ... sixty thousand ... yes nine sixty six into a Nineteen sixty six and they did so um they broke ground in September of Nineteen sixty precedent\nJohnson was there with his family of course many state in Catholic Church officials that ended\nAnd that was the opening and the dedication of the shrine that we know today of course then or there's been a lot more construction I'm actually the lower church is where the replica of the altar a from a\nUs nuclear is is a is an a to to the point of relics and crutches and things that you see it's just a ... or all their uh again it's it's a very moving it's a it's a beautiful replica and\nOf course the chapels there's a retreat house now the national shrine something I Love the cafeteria is also there are a Porsche language school a very large cemetery that's in four sections in fact the barn and the original barn were the first chapel was\nIs on the cemetery grounds and I believe the four sections of the cemetery or one section is open to just Catholics in general\nAnd other to clergy and monks or another to some historic people and of course then ... is not ... yes or for soldiers and\nUm it's it's it's a big site but very manageable for everyone to see and uh as I said it it it's very moving a course in polling I Believe a\nJust the hope is celebrated on August twenty six I think I think of course many pilgrims go to the national shrine into us time Pennsylvania the same day a there's a large pilgrimage on October seventh just you know last week for a ... the day celebrating our lady of holy Rosemarie\nAnd of course with the ... large cemetery November second all souls day\nI also found we weren't doors down for two days\nUh there there is a lot to see it's a very stark ah Mercer county where ... located was one of the original ... yeah it's about three miles north of Philadelphia was one of the original counties in ah Pennsylvania a William Penn actually established accounting sixteen eighty two\nSo there's a lot to do in the area\nUm but at the shrine for me was the highlight\nA badly because it's how many games are coming\nTo a thorough and they said that\nThat shine and then of course that probably they as many as ... or ... about that because I wasn't there a few years back in ... when there wasn't that many\nThere are are a number of
