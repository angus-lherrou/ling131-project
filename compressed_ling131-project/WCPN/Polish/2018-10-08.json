east\nMy father at the time was uh Fifteen Years old stepson was Seventeen twelve went on a horse covered carriage and after ten days on the road they finally stopped close to the Russian border\nUm two days later who September seventeenth was on a Sunday Morning\nMy father got up early to walk in the countryside\nAnd as he was strolling in the countryside he saw a a Russian soldier on a horse only the two of them in this field the soldier approached him he came as close to about ten Fifteen meters away\nAnd then he realized it was just a Fifteen year old boy so he Gallup to wake\nMy father was of course very terrified uh but then you heard of rumbling and the ground started to shake\nAnd eventually over the horizon he saw Russian tanks coming over into the countryside and he knew at that point for the first time that polling was in really serious trouble because not only was Germany\n... from the east and author I\nWas the very first person to see the Russian tanks you know he he was all veiled documented so he ran back to the home they were they were they were staying with a family there were staying with three different families ah some my father was actually staying out of

... there was a a river the sign river\nAnd that river was the dividing point between Russian occupation and German occupation\nSo my father and their family they were held they lived in a monastery on the Russian side of the border unable to cross to go back to the German side which would take them to their home\nOf course living as refugees they experienced many difficulties\nOr they saw people being sent families being sent away you know the Russians sending families way to Moscow people they had met people that helped them were were being sent away or just on that Moscow to Siberia so that they experienced all this\nAnd finally in about April a ... and my father also observed that on the Russian side of the river artillery had been manned\nOf pointing at the Germans and he noticed that the Germans had installed ... or ... um artillery pointed that the Russians so he began to believe that these two countries don't seem to be very friendly with one another\nIn about April or they actually the Germans S. S. officers came over and they arranged in agreement to allow any polish citizens who had papers to go back to their homes in Poland\nIt was a difficult decision but my father's family actually felt that they were better off in their own home in Poland even though the German occupation was very difficult\nThey felt that was better than being under Russian occupation\nThis is only the beginning you know parts [noise] um and in the first part I also explain how what it was like to live in German occupation in Boston the the dangers of living under German occupation [noise]\nPolish a center of Cleveland dot org website or um called the ... center at you won six eight eight three twenty eight twenty eight\nThank you I Do not ... not to go down that by that ...
