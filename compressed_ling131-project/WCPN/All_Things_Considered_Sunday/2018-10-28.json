people and how are you holding up and how is the city holding out\nUm it's difficult uh our hearts are broken collectively in Pittsburgh this a community is small a Pittsburgh is a small city and what happens to one part of it affects all of us\nWe'd ask the number of people to describe this community to us and I'm like you to describe it to us what is what a squirrel hill all about\nWell it's um I live five blocks from where are the events took place um it's the most diverse neighborhood and all of western Pennsylvania\nAnd it's I'm a very tight knit community that is the historic a base of Pittsburgh Jewish community for over one hundred years\nUnfortunately um events like this are no longer rare in American Life and I wondered when you have seen other communities face something like that hasn't been running through your mind like ... what I Do in the situation I mean as you first got the call this the first calls were coming into this with this\nEvent is taking place I find myself wondering what were you thinking and how'd you how'd you thought to yourself who I think that you would have to face something like that\nSo I have a um\nStrategy with my chief of staff on weekends or if he calls I I'm may not pick up on the first time but if he ever calls back two times I'll know that it is something that is a crisis it was the first time he's ever had to do that\nAnd

had the opportunity to talk to them era Walsh today was Boston in the Boston Marathon and I'm trying to\nRealize how to get not only the strategy of the police in public safety but also

I mean I Wish it were to measure that really shouldn't have done because we want to ... I I get it on our soldiers\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area that's right I I talked to Lisa flesh or Jackson enter nice\nEli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in a synagogue and this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified with what happened and I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but it didn't happen\nOn everybody in the community and recover strong and some are going to make it through\nAnd uh as I said she was with her knees to sixteen Eli they both so you know just as many generations of the family have ties to the neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\nWell I went to\nA tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that were\nSo so what did they make a bowl of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and in Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have gun laws but we definitely don't need to have you know security guards at our schools at our temples that our churches\nShouldn't have to I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how\nWell fair you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah thanks tucked in\nAnd other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life and I got the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed a lot to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today does yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back and I open\nAnd affirming you mean everything every once in a while because everyone is welcome to sexual or writing everyone is welcome and and knowing welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple\nOf ah folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they do not stay to worship\nBut they did come and to say thank you for it\nNot that far from here and I didn't have to wonder you I mean have you ever hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses and on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events of because he was a police officer in wide hole nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening for us personally um I I Try to allow garbage the urge to give me the bowl ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I Can't allow hatred to intimidate me\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was being was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that and of course the nursery attendant\nThat has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating and different the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I was running through my head tenants plans that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nI grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school or things like that\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking of how\nWe also met a father and son ... and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and owner said his own life experiences allow him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American beer and block and there were you really know about how these things are very few walk through or certain ... ah people to look at you funny\nOr don't want to feel do you should be there because a year or so your color\nMassey what about you I get the sense that this resonated with you even though it wasn't this particular attack was directed at you and I guess if I can you just described why that is because\nI remember I was looking at the news last yesterday and I thought about reminder says I'm gay and Orlando resonated with me\nI'm also black and the south Carolina shooting residents me because it was people who are religious and they got killed because their their religious and this residents with me because it's it's ...

E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleventh people who were shot to death at a local synagogue the Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania\nLawrence is outside the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh me all day Quinn welcome thank you so much for talking to us thank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... some lovely now um you also spent some time in squirrel hill the neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there [noise]\nYeah I mean people were out in scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you could see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what you said\nI came today that\nWaiting patient and now today I think I'm going to let them read the articles and these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just give them a space [noise] have\nThat happened and what they thought they were really moved by the family when the Holocaust or week\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into dance Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nAnd they were really specials we learn a known for many years whenever I go\nTo a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding or some kind of case two of them are always seeing the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an uptick of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nI felt like people were in the sorrow this sort of a cycle of sorrow and then tried in the solidarity of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying\nMost of these people were old enough to be grandparents but the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence thank you\nThank you and as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children\nAnd how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on\nShootings and this is something that is really on people's\nMinds and fortunately I've covered several of these now my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right on the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in the tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified them\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue the neighborhood outside the synagogue you also with the other places tell us about that\nYou actually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually and\nAh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want to place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six\nWe're from Canada so we just\nIt was very new to us and living here for the last year to start seeing more regularly [noise]\nAcross the room Alicia Hoffman was also ensure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand um [noise]\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I have to think about how we will\nHoffman grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has\nTies to Senegal a lot of my\nPricing upsetting you know disappointing that that people get the sun and their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and and think that they [noise]\nDevin deal runs the make shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work\nHard to um know that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with feeling [noise]\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as a tool\nAnd I'm being\nWith the community right now feels are important and powerful for me to still\nSays today's plant originally focused on Halloween but after the shooting she switched things up and encourage the kids to build models of houses and buildings and other familiar places\nThey care about places that make Pittsburgh home Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh [noise]\nThank you for that and finally today I reached out to an old friend to give us one more perspective on yesterday's shooting David trip meant we used to work together in Washington DC now he is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nHe lived just three blocks from the tree of life synagogue and he's published too powerful pieces one for his own
