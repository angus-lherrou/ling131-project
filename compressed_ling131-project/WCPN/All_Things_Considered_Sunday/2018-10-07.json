the um day I'll tell my son about all\nThe state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats and employees have us based international organizations unless the partners are legally married before the end of the year\nA spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote insurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote but critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could face persecution back home but if they do not marry some partners could face deportation James Wally Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had\nFirst hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate back\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nYou can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people ... who is the diplomatic representative of the Vatican informed me that my husband because he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was\nOr and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight to make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of a policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for dependent these is not the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this has to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August felt that was essential that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U. S.\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who was a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nIs one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president's say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get a visa the only way that would be guaranteed is if they go through some how\nThere to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global ambassador thank you so much for talking to us well it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you'd have the best days\nNow to our series on China's growing influence in the world that influences felt particularly strongly in that in Latin America where Chinese investments are growing rapidly\nIt's often said that Brazil provides the food on China's dinner tables from soybeans to beef and chicken those experts helped make China Brazil's biggest trading partner as NPR's Philip Reeves reports Brazil also has something else the Chinese want\nOne guy you see this ever again don't then\nPlaying soccer under will often in some look again and you'll notice that something different about this ... we're in Brazil get over players Chinese teenagers who've come here eleven thousand miles from home to pursue a tree\nMade you mean if if you go I Want to go the my country to him in China\nThey work up to the my big ...\nPi I'm In ... up anti is Seventeen he's here to learn how to make it to the top in professional soccer for football as everyone here calls and he's glad he came\nI think I like the brother of all I Want the plane here because the step by step here for for me it's good but I Want to make a professional player so everything the importance\nOf soccer training academy near a town called ... took place in southeast Brazil\nIt's part of the minor league Brazilian club called ...

Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week\nIn connection with the killing of the teenager look McDonalds but recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police office\nTo Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year\nAnd policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs who wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me you know what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for the something off who says versus said there's something offices\nSo from my perspective it's really what drives they'll send a winds of police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what that I ... and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turned that we as saying that these dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most pressing yes we're looking more of them will face a police officer and meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity out west I handling and all persons with mental illness so it's not the topic violations that and\nThe tainted by what kind of of act doors as it as it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased or racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years his vote on type policing United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have to cut us off it out to come\nSo somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court using police officers pushing back to demonstrate so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take your anger out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of the government was a police us\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\nWhen we're looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are that part of the ... the activity if it does definitely\nEntertaining each shoe office so frequently a seat in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure\nGiven that in political development that might be putting their life in danger so this technical issue is how you approach and the ... and how you go to the house\nOr well you know that it's the ... who is armed and dangerous the problem is that we have eight thousand police agencies\nAnd when you have a thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would certainly help us make gay the negative perception of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty as an outcome most premeditated activities that was directed against them explicit plant another democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one year in separate incidents killed by members of the topic this is absolutely cannot accept\nThat as Maria
