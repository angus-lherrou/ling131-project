killing\nYesterday the Saudi Government abandoned its earlier claim that it had no idea what happened to ... he was last seen after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the consulate and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nDeflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin ... they know that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day to show gee arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump\nSaid he found the Saudi account of what happened credible he also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten billion which is a military order but this is equipment and various things order from Saudi Arabia [noise] four hundred and fifty million dollars I think it's over a million jobs that's not helpful for us to chancellor and order like that\nThat are far more than it hurts them\nOn Capitol Hill however lawmakers from both parties were sharply skeptical of the Saudis story\nAnd German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded further clarity saying still nothing has been cleared up Turkish investigators interviewed constantly re employees\nAnd Turkish media report the staff provided information that further calls into question the Saudi explanation staff members said they were told to take two days off including October

department and he's with us now from Washington DC Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us for pleasure you pointed out that Turkey's human rights record\nIs no different or no better really than Saudi Arabia is when it comes to suppressing dissent suppressing a media criticism so first of all is it fair to assume that the details that we've been getting so far from the Turkish media and other sources came with the approval of the Turkish government if that's the case what's Turkey's role in this what's their agenda in this\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Prime

particularly unarmed citizens during police encounters in a few minutes we're going to hear from Texas lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office today to uh Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times this er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa\nI'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me now I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not says example Gino how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nOther black men at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty that aren't as connected to issue their mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that then I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this was an important story and who shouted out at the root causes and story that needed to be told\nThat's about a a Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us on our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nWe said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life\nThis happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black but according to research by the ...\nThat's this with education he drafted a law that just don't into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know my family\nWhy are you know brings\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring to video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over a position of African Americans and Latinos that end up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement door traffic stops and I guess ... it's kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least if I had a baby right traditions of citizens and police officers at what's lost here\nIs that people are getting the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on the video is really a kind of sets the stage for additional course contact for both the sort of some and also pollution police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to fight the objectives of a what we want\nPolice officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the life of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to text to what appear to be two white teenage girls and\nCannot Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video\nIs as a primer you know if we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we defied behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are when\nYou have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in it you'll get fat I Can't\nI ... I think have me why is that irrelevant when they issue that used to spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person doesn't look like him if that's the source of the ten cent why would you measure let me ask this question\nYou can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights or I thought put it in schools and making it mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of police academies and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers that was the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both how do we make certain that there is content that deals with that biased piece how do we make certain that and police departments that they have psychological examinations that\nIt shouldn't have to say that this is going to be with it because it's not it's not perfect but it's a step in the right direction in order to make sure that we know what the ... or ... ... ...\nI guess can watch it being made at Mitchell's Ohio city kitchen using fresh ingredients from area farms an organic unfair trade ingredients from around the world Mitchell's homemade\nDot com Baldwin Walsh University school of business presenting information about the double use graduate business programs at an open house on Wednesday October twenty fourth at six PM in Berea registration ...

as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes and why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role and doing that that's the conservative legal group\nProject and that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions which I knew about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks which you keep the training secret and signed something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us it's good to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut she spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and they're going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system\nAmerican conservative legal movement\nThat it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThere yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act in\nAll kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create\nPipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at death um\nCreating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who condemned be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not find and what his heritage\nTo suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close melts about it a try them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were make news significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges were\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggest that perhaps they might try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years that's Adam ... he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks busting your shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize at the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne report this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the re boot of the popular nineties show after star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which for me or this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only a pain pills for two days after surgery was just I'd be pro [noise] it's gotta be wrong\nWe when I could talk about so we called Sam ...\nSo much for joining us pleasure to be here or self like you're also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist\nFor the wall Street Journal online Jeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you say\nYou know it's really interesting because any time a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right and the struggle case one of the things that was really strange to me is that\nOne of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of racist tweet the got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there was a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world so is our culture guy though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI Know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of resembles was powerful so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job actually of addressing a very difficult topic\nI said I Know you're not a critic but you're deeply immersed in covering this crisis okay and I just wondered if you felt about it as a person who knows a lot about the realities of the situation", "show_name": "All Things Considered
