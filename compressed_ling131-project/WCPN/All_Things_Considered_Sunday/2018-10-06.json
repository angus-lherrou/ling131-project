right here on Ninety point three WC PM [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the United States Supreme court\nThis afternoon the Senate confirmed cabinet on a vote a fifty two forty eight one of the closest margins ever\nMinutes later the White House announced that he would be sworn in during a private ceremony later today NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill it's got welcome thanks for joining a famous show so first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides\nAds that what's happening person after person into ...\nCircles who spent [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery\nSo that's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene descended struggling with its formal responsibilities and made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThis has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii So is this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I Am left with Mr President anger Harry discuss\nAnd a process that could not seen the truth of what Dr for I Try to tell us\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed\nMore than I can say those who have unleashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy or more sport they have put them through\nWhat let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about that\nDid Republican after Republican was making that same argument often and strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing bet Ford was sincere that's a word that kept\nAnd her or that they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday ensuring Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed to the court that there were no corroborating accounts more questions the not\nSo in the end we have the same result as Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill testified about Clarence Thomas a woman comes forward with allegations and the man she accused ends up on the Supreme Court\nWell let's talk about sort of more broadly for the minute or so that we have left you were anywhere near the capital if you were watching or listening you could hear those rockets a protest mainly for people opposing cabinet but we also saw some

probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd she would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh\nNow we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that cabinet assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet this the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she has done a has unleashed\nAre uh have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now which makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted\nThey did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise]\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to be an important\nMoment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nThey were going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November that was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred fifty thousand workers starting in November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe just have to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at Jefferson ville Indiana at Amazon so on the day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film at center since it opened a about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen\nAnd I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now than the way the two years for my stocks to us\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at a facility that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five\nAn hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five an hour all it's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles\nFor the last three weeks I wars in the ... for the Miami I started working off a store is a process that goes I mean that you received a merchandise and made to order and the inventory\nA star making seven dollars for hours and know the increase we're going to be making Fifteen dollars an hour after November first\nHow you feel very excited about it because of their provider I now I can do to my family are better quality and also I think it's more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for certain full time job\nIs going to change my life so we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho do want to raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nSo there have been a few reports in a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody\nAre get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated the company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would the Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were before\nSo I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase and the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nAny idea why why why did they announce it so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company um Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that this conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for a family of four\nNow that is a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been put in quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nHere before we wrap up your part of the Amazon announcement also mentioned that the company plans to lobby for a higher federal minimum wage and I'm asking you to speculate but do you think this was going to have an impact beyond Amazon itself\nI think that was one of the most important parts of their announcement\nTalking about federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five cents it is an extremely low\nResponsible forestry management ... is a member of the U.S green building council more information at public Cleveland dot com\nThe Cleveland museum of

there's been a verdict in the trial of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen more than a year later dash cam video sparked large protest when it showed the office\nFrom member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life or connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there were some tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nFor your [laughter] guilty of that [noise] we find that kind of aggravating\nFire [noise] first WB\nEasiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting with climate Donald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to\nJobs well we'll just have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that day started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting your day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officer said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporters on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released of the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd so and talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform look\nFor the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for them to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here\nThat's Jenn ... she's the host of sixteen shots at a pod cast WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke in the shooting death of the Koran McDonald's she was kind of to join us from WBEZ each in white thank you so much for talking\nWith thank you Michelle\nNow we want to head into the barber shop to put a bow and it's incredibly divisive an emotional week in Washington D. C. the barber shop is where we gather interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their mind so we're going to go back to the major story of the week the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we've been hearing a lot from senators and spokespersons and activists but we wanted to see if we could broaden things out to hear other conversations\nAnd we thought who better to talk to the local radio calling hosted journalists who hear directly from their audience is on a regular basis so we called Liz Redskins she's a reporter with Alaska Public radio who's been closely following one of the most closely watched senators Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski\nWho ultimately decided not to support the cabinet nominations the only Republican not to do so she's here with us from the studios welcome thanks for coming high that Charlie Sykes is with us once again he hosted a conservative political talk show for many years in Wisconsin he's an author and a political commentator and he's with us once again and buy Skype Charlie welcome back\nWith you\nOkay great I'm Glad to hear and then finally on the phone with us is Carrie Miller she is the host an NPR News with Carrie Miller that's at Minnesota Public radio Carrie thank you so much for joining us Michele thank you and let\nMe start by saying that nobody is pretending that this is scientific research but I did want to reach out to all of you because I Know that people your audience is reach out back to you and Kerry I'm going to start with you because you host a calling\nI Will not be voting Democrat almost gonna rip altogether ... it's like we have turned against each other brother against rather to shrug and sister [noise] this is really bad climate that we're in right now\nI I'm very dismayed with the choice of kicking party over morals or character and also I think it was fairly obvious from the proceedings that Kevin I wasn't fully truthful\nTo carry a ... as you can hear you are getting people from all across the political spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us what the ... aren't falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right or in the show that you're playing the comments from my question to the audience was is what's going on with\nBrett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking of some very competitive races in Minnesota\nAnd I you know I can usually predict\nHow the calls are going to come in\nWhat I Am saying is people are highly engaged and it really knowledgeable about what was happening and they were calling with some unexpected things to say I mean you hear that one caller saying\nI'm disappointed that it's all about party you hear the other caller saying I usually vote democratic this has turned me off and I think that's pretty representative of the calls that I've been getting over the last couple\nOf weeks without this certainly what all are greatly and off their turned off by ... by the their politics of this\nTurley what about you what are people tweeting new and same to you and social media and and and and elsewhere yeah I Would want to just mention of course I don't have a radio talk show any more but uh yeah there's there's no question about it that you have a high level of been gay humid and there's this is one of those moments where the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered Sunday", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "06"}
