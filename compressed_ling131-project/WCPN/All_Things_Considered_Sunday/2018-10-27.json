all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin broadcasting today from member station W H y y in Philadelphia we're here because we wanted to spend some time today talking about the mid term elections which are just a few days away\nBut we are going to begin our program with news of another horrific mass shooting this time at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania eleven people died at least six people were injured according to officials a public safety official in the city describe the synagogue as a horrific crime scene\nPresident Trump addressed the shooting at a political event this afternoon and said federal authorities have been dispatched help to help investigate he condemned the shooting as a wicked act of\nMurder the vial age\nAppears there was no tolerance for him to ... in America or for any form of religious or racial hatred for prejudice\nReporter Sarah Schneider of member station W E s ... is covering this tragedy and she is with us now sorry thanks so much for talking with us I think you which we know about the identity of the victims police officers we know were among the wounded can you tell us anymore\nWe don't know anything about we haven't identified the eleven people who were killed today we do know that none of the people who were killed were children we do know that there were six I'm injured victims\nAnd a two of the injured victims or a sixty one year old female a Seventy year old male and then also uh for police officers two of those officers were\nFirst responders and I'm too were swat officers\nCan you tell us a bit more about the synagogue and the community where this happened\nYet the synagogue is in um squirrel hill it's this vibrant you know active Jewish community in Pittsburgh and um today when I was on the scene we saw you know many people who were concerned about\nFriends and family members who they knew were in the building that day uh this morning and a lot of people just confused trying to figure out where those people were\nCan you tell us a bit more about the alleged gunman and I understand that he was taken into custody alive\nYeah we do know the government is alive he's in fair condition with\nA gunshot wound um that the director of a public safety and Pittsburgh says he believes to be from police officers they haven't given any other um details about this person a but we do know that\nUh there will they they assume that you know charges will come down possibly today\nCan you tell us a bit more about what type of weapon or weapons he used and can you tell us anymore\nIf he used all of them in the shooting and we were told he's been in the building he was in the buildings day for about twenty minutes and ... exiting the synagogue um officers confronted him and that's when the two swat officers were injured um that heat retreated into the building\nYou know how many people were in a synagogue at the time and if there were any security guards posted and the reason I raise that as a President Trump rejected the idea that this has anything to do with gun laws but he said that if the synagogue had had an armed guard inside that the government could have been stopped so can you tell us any more about that yeah\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row ascent with seating for up to eight and a choice of

considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia we are of course following the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh today\nWe will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling\nAnd talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of the blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night now though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house so we've been talking with candidates\nThey've been asking all of them what's on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY states Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and\nI think he's so much for hosting us and thanks to all the people who offered us pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and allies say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state I mean for the last six years Pennsylvania's ... have had congressional maps\nThat were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenge last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not a federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map a a an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off who will spend in wrecks\nControversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to\nTo undermine you well one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has to attract an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money\nIt's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but what's also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick he's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace\nWho's never run for office before and he poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nWill because it's an extraordinary you're\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent but just a moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid in this atmosphere of this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America\nAnd destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI or intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinge upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here\nThe on a specific level the big issues you're our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue\nThat ties all of us together as money on politics my opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate pac money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in\nBecause that's what is blocking the people's business\nFrom getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the ... amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests\nStops every single thing that the people want\nYou know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district and the expense of media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that tells the candidate boats\nAnd so yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voices going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nIs huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just\nHate the tone so he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in a referendum on Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nGoes around the country singer vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially\n... ... voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing and the last thing I think anybody wants to see is ... doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things that's got well just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that\nWell Scott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative and most of it\nAnd what about the Trump factor we talked about that is is is the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about the might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nOr the feeling that the Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo as we said Democrat Scott Wallace is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian fits Patrick fitzpatrick is a former FBI agent the only form an FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also been a vocal critic of President Trump on certain issues\nSuch as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand sixteen Alexis\nHow accomplished artist Patrick invited us to meet him at his parent's house in a suburb of ... town where he grew up as the youngest of eight siblings and despite being the beneficiary of a lot of this so called independent expenditures the Davis just talked about flowing into the race on his behalf that's Patrick said that he agrees with his Democratic opponent that there's too much money in politics\nI could not agree more that money in politics of the problem I was a supervising the FBI's political corruption unit in April of two thousand and one of the ...\nWhen did or corruption cases and I said sure it's going to increase the corruption because money's the root of all evil and money in politics is the root of all corruption

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Brian Tyler first\nIdentified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident or in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today a here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd over the next several days and weeks with a look at everything and the suspects life is home his vehicle is social media and his movements over the last several days\nUh Jones says officers were covered in assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are gonna searches home they say that they'll take precautions in case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point or that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but then of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has called this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges in this case he says that there's no place for hatred and violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but\nWe're gonna have to wait and see what all those ... charges are going to entail\nAnd could you tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight and in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania\nAs a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was an stood up\nAnd just as briefly as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there\nAre there's a lot of work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts for reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiments a and the alleged shooter in this case was of course a lot of and in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\nThat if NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race\nAnd pipe bombs were sent to prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility\nThey told us they hope for more unity and that is a message that might have special residents in Gettysburg the site of an ethics civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three one of the country's bloody is we're more than fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach bringing people of different political views together it's called politics fats and stability Democrat cart\nSent and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved though was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign saw a lot of civility a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so odd resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the you know\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had a it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who've been calling for something like this lawyer John ... Ohio or I don't know maybe Joe Biden you could you know the same argument ... former governor of Pennsylvania for sixty of homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car came up with a structure for that Darcy what about you is this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no less and really\nI um I have always done pretty staunch Democrat I that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive\nI never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved I think that realizing that that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find\nIs has just been a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish I was hoping that we could come to understand each other more\nWhen it's on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue odor but I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the\nStory of the blind men and the the elephant which um I don't know if you're familiar with Philip ... book\nExpert political judgment in which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view\nThe more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example\nSo Darcy not that you were saying I don't want to talk to those people many ... but um [laughter] what you\nDo is I'm hungry for this experience as others were what made you finally decided to come well we're really\nWas cars invitation and cars and courage meant that got me to come to the corrupt and then it was\nThe surprise\nAt the civility as a conversation that made me stay I tend to be a fairly quiet person who doesn't express myself very well and a group situation and so\nI don't like the idea of going into a place where there's going to be arguing and fighting and and I feel like I'm going to just shut down I Will just shut down show this kind of environment where everybody is expected to have something to say really helped me and knowing that people were not going to argue with me or shut me down\nChat here's where I I have to impose upon our new friendship and put you on the spot true because for a lot of people I think on the left but also a lot of people who are just living their lives to the big elephant in the room is the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered Sunday", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "27"}
