Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo all who had worked to secure\nFor instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given\nSupernatural wisdom well what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president regimen type air to one uh he had been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course\nUm there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department\nAnd especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house

Georgia allegations of voter suppression or grabbing headlines and the tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivist they're suing can because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this that we call that mark ... he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nThat's driving with All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely ...\nUntil you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia\nWhere did this law come from it was a policy of the\nSecretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... come fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way to federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that this life it's proportionally affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nRain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas to voting system does she have a history of getting involved with this kind of

vote however in Georgia the way our elections work as the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing ...\nElections in enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported a Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including\nWell over two hundred thousand new voters just since the may primary election what's\nThe mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere was a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on voting\nRights and Republicans are saying that it's a

of my God I think I can do in my purse and\nSarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us so we're not here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of pimp types in here there are\nYou know there's a a man who's object to find women who's a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never well I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by my parents and my marketability\nI'm kind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so we're writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling for me\nWhat is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOf the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself being really\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have begun smelled on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop and there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accident which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods and goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accented English actually just means I speak to laugh\nFirst I always take every character you know\nI can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working out some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and she said but it goes cracking good job or she is a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit\nSo you know I really try to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives that people's who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of e pluribus unum within me\nI heard a lot of that and gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure our pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called Code Switch it's all about race and identity and America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us\nHe spent the first twelve years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and when I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was an identity crisis\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational adopt these together\nThe narrative about my adoption was really centered around my mom being a savior\nMy language my mannerisms my experiences are all in foreign by the white family I grew up with\nYou told us you feel alone and want to know if there are other people like you out there\nYou asked us if you were a bunch of polls are yours and ours by trying to reclaim identities that you weren't exposed to when you were growing up\nA Korean trans racial adoptee wrote to say quote there is no one I can let my hair done with or be Asian with because I'm not Asian but I Am guy sorry ... thank you if you
