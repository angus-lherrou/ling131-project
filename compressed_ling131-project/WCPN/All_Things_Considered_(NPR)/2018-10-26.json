Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nIt's

of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at

were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here it's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase willow run mean to you at this point when you hear today a sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here and\nThere was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but ah yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son the has that

think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the ...\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton
