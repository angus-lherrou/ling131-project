about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank\nOthers heard Kavanaugh's testimony differently Here's Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer this morning\nBased on the accounts by his high school and college classmate she is grossly ms characterizes relationship with alcohol\nCommon thread judge Kavanaugh

comments about his drinking\nYes that was that Fox News interview that he did with Martha ... this was before the hearing\nFocus on academics and athletics going to church every Sunday at little flower a wartime service projects in friendship\nHe did mention the other parts of it the the partying\nAnd you ask people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school I think all of us are probably done things we look back on and high school and regret or cringe a bit and that's not what we're talking about\nYou can come away from most of that interview thinking\nHere's someone who was really studious and didn't really have time for that much partying um but he was asked in the interview by Martha Macau him whether he ever drink so much that he couldn't remember the night before no ah that never happened never said anyone I don't remember anything about last night no\nSo that's the description who gave Fox News several days later he spoke to the Senate Judiciary committee under oath and here's what he said in his opening statement\nI drank beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I have too many beers sometimes others did I liked fear I still like beer but I'm not drink beer to the point of watching out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nAnd that set the stage for many hours of conversation between cabin on senators about beer\nYes there were probably two dozen references to beer during the hearing and senators asked about it on a number of occasions including as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse who is a Democrat and ask Kevin about your book in trees where he referenced a Ralph club\nYou know I got a weak stomach whether it's with beer or with spicy food or anything so\nThe vomiting but you reference in the ...

T. S. D. and depression NPR's Quil Lawrence covers veterans and the VA and he joins us now like Well hi or tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight a he's a lawyer he was a former Missouri secretary of state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer back in two thousand six and then came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt\nIn two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad hundreds and Kansas\nSenator boy and he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling an A R Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these and then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says he's I'd like to see some of the barn do this\nAnd the ad got him national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician\nWell let our message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago it candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nUh that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example or having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in ... in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization he started to something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment and that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage rather than a military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and um [noise] I mean I Can't think of a politician who disclosed is sort of thing except usually on the you know on the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior\nBut uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistics saying that suicide has increased especially among cancers generation of veterans and Cantor said he wanted to do this in part to help others confront this in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nThat some parents Quil Lawrence thanks ... thank you Ari now we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company\nIt's a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this year than a meeting in salary at Amazon was less than one to nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports and Amazon corporate executives stood today before and more than\nSeven hundred workers in California warehouse and told them they are getting a raise [noise]\nThe executive Dave Clark he told me this was one of his best days at work and the Twenty years it's been at Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR sponsors I reached Clark adds that California warehouse\nWhere we're announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum made before any other\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I ask Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was just to underline on dollar range of over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff Fager [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of base of speech and Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well and the wages for his lowest paid employees inside baseball spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing in tents\nThat is good for society all big institutions of any kind\nOr going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected today in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's as soon as that are made to derive\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAt our hope and believe but I'm a college will cause other companies like Wal Mart for food in the short reading the world's those are good for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco hit fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news and see how it could be other than good news is the\nAuthor is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decided to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon's\nWe think is the right number really urging Congress to me\nBut Senator Sanders says he hopes the ... those stamp of approval convinces the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is right Alina Selyukh NPR News\nWith all the
