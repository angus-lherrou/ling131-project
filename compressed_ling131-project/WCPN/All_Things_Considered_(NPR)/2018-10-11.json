all of this hey how ya hello let's start with the Y y con yeah even there today\nHe was a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump\nThey've been exchanging compliments for a while it it really picked up after World War the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial and west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had\nOh look good this is our president\nWith was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are\nAnd Trump claims that west coming out in support of them has boosted his standing in the African\nWith the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation do we even know what they talked about today\nI think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things in some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence in Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with some of West interests\nUh Kim car Daschle in West or his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues she's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time drug than what\nWas the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nAllowed what he's going to talk about publicly was that a about the freedom of Larry Hoover who was a

beginning police around the country or started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individuals\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in that debate as a because it\nOh your second cousins once removed in these debates as to actually identify you the same way that a GPS system you there's multiple that's I'd like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify and supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThe picnic doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals with this technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either to commit\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police covering the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that leftover DNA behind a wheel K relieved if foreign governments are going to exploited the technique\nTo identify us to get them for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWorking on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect in murders of children things like that and it's just [noise] things that need to be\nThat the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it is an misused Rob Stein NPR News [noise]\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero was

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do it different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a\nRough few years in twenty sixteen murders jump to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\n... director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on to straighten it out fest is no reason for what's going on there\n[noise] but what that means it turns out opposition be administrative should just\n... aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump says\nThe widespread stopping and frisky potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes this sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime worse and that this new consent decree is more of the same But Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in really\nHadn't had any keep from them account now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nUh if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to a former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word is just as you move to stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias\nThe it's a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing in Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed\nOut at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like ab loving little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers\nMartin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew is alive those were the words from spokesmen for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian the way you rocket carrying two astronauts to the international space

Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome like you are so we're talking with you also do this\nI mean we had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut\nWas a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launch they would working together for a couple of years leaving ring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to how Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely after\nWhen would be the next ... you could go on a mission like this again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to based today you know kind of like\nGosh all that preparation you into that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and I don't know who will fly next\nIt's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a\nDesign problem a manufacturing problem who knows [noise] and then once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years then we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or ...\nShows are going to be ready to fly again and window we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... that doctors to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they\nCan come home anytime they want but if they ... to\nCome home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough shift that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so\nIt really it causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be look really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very much for

NPR News the state department\n[noise]\nListening to all things considered from NPR News scientists think they have answered a critical question about how our eyes develop the ability to see color\nPart researchers got around that optical by growing human retinas ... cash\nGrowing a human retina requires a lot of patients it takes between seven month than a year or Eldridge should know she's a graduate student in a lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive\nFor the first week of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on them every other day so they're a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston says these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light and colored Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an Eldridge shot chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe've discussed this crazy idea of could we use these human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors sensing cells in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision and a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't sense read they don't have these red detecting so and so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first then comes cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fly right hormone was involved in the development of these colors ... so called cone so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nAdded fire right hormones to that dish during their development and we got more red green ... developing I'm In Oregon\nThe emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nOne is to restore color vision to people that are colorblind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that's the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition has been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnson hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular Oregon writes\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says that he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye\nThese studies show that the similarity is quite high\nEnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature controls the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and disease\nAnd how to develop better treatments the new research appears in the journal science Jon

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on the agenda gun violence in Chicago west told Trump he opposes stop and frisk police tactics the president's ideas have differed greatly from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do\nA different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's\nHad a rough few years in twenty sixteen murders jump to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nMy of director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on a strict enough as it is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out the opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk from says the widespread\nRacial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops the administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in order to\nHaven't had any keep from them account now\nMadigan is the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to a former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word as justice William of who's stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more police and\nPolicing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing in Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed\nOut at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously you guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got it\nTo Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers marching ... NPR News\nThank God the crew is alive those were the words from spokesmen for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian the way you rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station failed during its and today\nThat lift off had proceeded smoothly for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise]\nAnd I have five sons have an emerging failure of the [noise]\nThe crew American Nick Cage and Russian Alexei option in our space after an emergency landing in context on\nThree other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're return home might be delayed for more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you are still be talking with you also\nSo this was going to be American Nick Hague first time into space the second for like the ocean and what kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nOf them and training for decades Alexei as a cause but not for quite a while as you say what space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut\nWas a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this large working together for a couple of years we\nTop of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to how Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely back to her\nWhen would be the next chance you could go in and mission and again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like\nGosh all that preparation you into that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and I don't know who will fly\nNext it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information\nPeople be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem of manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's gonna take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a shift that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed the\n... and they were backing to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime\nThey want but if they ... to come home than they are basically abandoned us\nStart to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process\nComing up Chris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very much for joining us today nice to talk
