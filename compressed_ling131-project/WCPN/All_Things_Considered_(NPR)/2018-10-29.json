credit clause do not given to the theater to not be afraid to move forward arm in arm\nWhat have the people you've spoken to set about how they expect to move forward what they see in the days ahead\nThere is a lot of talk about leaning on each other about grieving being both a purse\nAnd not to shut it down and that it will take time and Alan ... is at Carnegie Mellon student he says when you moved here Pittsburgh is Jewish community open to him well Tim Tim with open arms and and he said it's difficult to think that that same community has absorb so much harder\nTo have I Know that it will come out\nAnd that was the whole room stood for a moment of silence I Wish we could play the sound is because it's moving but that'd be weird and said the cow dish rabbi Jamie Gibson pulled the crowd that while the ... the prayers often said in times of deaths there's no mention of death in the prayer it's about face\nAnd that that's that's what I heard people expressing tonight is a faith that he can be overcome that Pittsburgh can be better and stronger\nPresident Trump and the first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to visit Pittsburgh tomorrow what if people you've talked to said about what they want to hear from President what they expect from a visit\nSo far it's not clear at the people that I've spoken with what they would expect or want the president to say it's been a mixed response in terms of thinking about their visit tomorrow\nA mayor our Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters earlier that he hoped the president would not do that while we were burying our dead and specifically that he doesn't he doesn't have enough public safety personnel to provide protection to the funerals that will start tomorrow ended the president's visit so it's still seems like a pretty mixed bag in terms of what people are feeling\nWhen you leave the scene of the vigil or the neighborhood of a synagogue does the entire city feel changed on edge in mourning what what's it like around Pittsburgh today [noise]\nCan't speak for the whole city but people seem to be very warm with each other opening there's been a lot of discussion of course in social media about I'm here for you

NPR station\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general Terence ... who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so they're already something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those existing two thousand\nJust goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional\nFive thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role get no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of firsts still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote location\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week oh there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only to support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would it be carrying arms or have any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall the\nPresident for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nAnd in this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks even lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now

running for reelection and a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running the campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't remember ever apologizing for anything\nI've said whatever I've said is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him win in twenty sixteen but Democrats like Marie Elena Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent images and\nTrue so he tells the plot that he's a moderate but when you see is voting record that is completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do not do that extra step and they just hear him and they say wow you know he sounds good\nHis opponent Democrat sending the car so Powell is trying to change that you know they need them
