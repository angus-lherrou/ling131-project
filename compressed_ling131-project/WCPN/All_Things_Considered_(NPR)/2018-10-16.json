[laughter] well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you\nThink yeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate\nTo stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name of ... it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has

intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got you know some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nI Would definitely agree with you ... and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics it's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and so ah [laughter] and I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here\nBecause by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm\nI was in college when HIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and demeaned but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the

send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the algae beauty community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think\nThose would be tea cute community steps up and wants to run for office kind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of a similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we use of all the overall national landscape for future algae tiki candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nOne of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and

understand how autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia interpret these remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with us she served at the state department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicit\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington and I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences in my relationship with Washington\nIf you take for example Philippine president do chair today a who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as a drug dealers\nThere is a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we killed people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was one of them are putting in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so he wasn't really possible to say that this was happening more because President Trump is in office\nThink they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad the first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare\nThe other western governments and they all do a day marched together or the issue simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself and when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition it deters other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these dictators but it's undermining the international alliances that used to speak with one strong voice against the actions of those leaders\nSupport for NPR comes from

talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's in men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt and tie down and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stay in my ... um\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow ... or corrections officers to give up fewer tickets for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThis is a gang related it's just women\nWant to have some control over\nResponse of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different passes the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules so special about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nOn

mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can sit institution so I mean that's a shame you know and it's helped me with my own my own shame and my own regret\nThis psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about them\nAre still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that has been chain for months at a time in a basement sold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now\nWomen can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show donned the warden\nLately the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said as you know ordinary sounds people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six\nIs the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one of their place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now it closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from us station above\nWhen women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night this is what prison cells today across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room\nStrips them all\nTheir senses are dignity\nGets back to wipe giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions

their countries and create better lives for their people\nCluster now faces scrutiny for ties to the Saudi crown prince after the potential murder of the Saudi journalist that story in ten minutes on Ninety point three [noise]\nThe mid term elections just a few weeks away and the sound of ideas hope to help you make an informed choice when casting your ballot for US Senator Ohio governor attorney general secretary of state treasurer and auditor I'm Mike McIntyre we talked with us\nJoin us at nine AM right here on Ninety point three\nFirst meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first\nUh and Cushman he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Christian or a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump or but there have been reports\nOn foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nSo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it I'm for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin so I'm On a\nAfter could show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him\nA and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that cushion or could act as a back channel ah to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family trauma and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear\nAs some of these dealings are are not transparent but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports\nAre that cushion or a Christian or a backed are associated of firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things considered had\nForty four all things

party candidates recognize that improving Ohio schools can lead to closing the skills gap\nWhere companies are having a harder time finding a competent workforce Republican Mike DeWine says\nThis is a process that must start early even before a child begins kindergarten he proposes raising the eligibility level for publicly funded early childhood education expanding access to twenty thousand more kids this wind says\nWill help children of low income families\nWho tend to begin school at a disadvantage\nWe have an obligation I think to reach these kids and if we're going to reach them we've got to do it very very early\nWhen it comes to support Democrat Richard Cordray wants to bring a variety of programs to the schools this includes mental health care dental care after school programs and parents support groups\nIt means that the services are provided right at the school where we know the students are going to be a day in day out\nAs opposed to the families very all the burden of the logistics\nBoth Cordray into wind have said they want to find a way to reduce standardized testing Cordray more specifically says he wants to Ohio schools to bring it all the way down to the federal minimum\nOver testing together was inadequate funding have narrowed school curriculums and push out many other meaningful ways to engage students\nWind also believes Ohio students can be held to a higher standard of learning without rigorous testing\nTeachers to teach the subject matter a into focus on that is is very very important and I think the pendulum frankly is one to four towards the testing you have to\nHe says part of his plan is to not make too many changes\nWe have to resist the temptation to constantly be changing the you know moving the goal line you know teachers just drove their hand sometimes when they talk to me and say you know just tell us what the rules are but for heaven's sake stop changing\nCordray says teachers need more input he also notes a national education news organization once ranked Ohio schools fifth in the country but the latest evaluation have the state ranked twenty first Cordray says to him that show schools need more support than what they're currently getting\nWe owe this decline in part to state lawmakers who've spent years funnily resources away from our public schools weakening our public schools in over regulating the classrooms in ways that make it harder for teachers to teach students the way they are trained to do\nCharter school accountability is another big topic on both agendas with the ... scandal at the center of it all the now closed online charter school overcharge the state by eighty million dollars for students at claimed to have but couldn't prove\nCordray the state's former attorney general says policymakers should have done a better job of keeping each ... and check his proposal would be too bad for profit companies from operating schools\nOur schools are not businesses and our children are not customers for those involved in the ... scandal for profit above our students needs\nThe wind the state's current attorney general defends his record on e caught saying he was the one who appointed the state's council to get that money back he says he would create a pay for performance model to add accountability for taxpayer money\nWhat we need to demand from the people who are running these schools is accountability and accountability means they don't get paid until we find out what that child has learned as part of his education\nOn the college level have universities freeze a student's tuition

in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district\nWhich has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of ... people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran and\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not yeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants\nStrict is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to algae to Q. people do you think that shapes your experience yeah\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got you know some wonderful fellows in and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell us so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent or a [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard to murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when HIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand it provided I think an opportunity\nAnd but when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that an anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans women of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we used it\nUh you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what a million discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with it so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nIs one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene Amelia do as well to those young people that are following behind us [noise] I Want to thank all\nThree of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire
