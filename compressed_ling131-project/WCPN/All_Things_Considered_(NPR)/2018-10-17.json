couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged\nEvidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall from MIT [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word that kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nTwain and it's all good going from the perspective on main such a law or not\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly\nVigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they had found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR

mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones whose house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking like somebody's trying to get in and the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I said everything was going to be okay for\nLast doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact\nSame can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says\nOh hi wins lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a longtime emergency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle in many cases gets old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on the probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a ruse down as you go further north and Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses\nHe says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that storm back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher global warming or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be proven it ... it is way the community is willing to adopt it will not\nRealtors home builders the insurance industry and many others will all have a voice as Florida considers how to prepare the panhandle for the next storm like hurricane

all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me\nWhy do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race merely creates an illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have race in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering wanted assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but often times the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this last year we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were scoring higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nDon't think that that's true at all clearly affirmative action has failed and at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\nHarvard up a trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context\nWhat do you think about idea so\nI think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty\nBecause when we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWhat type of all thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks so much for having me she's a junior at Harvard\nAnd you are listening to all things considered from NPR News\nFive forty for

Ohio's unemployment rate hit four point three percent number not seen since July two thousand one but history suggests another economic downturn is likely in the next few years\nBut each candidate says when he is governor a tax hike will not happen in the final debate between the candidates Democrat Richard Cordray said he's been clear on that\nWe do not lead us to raise taxes and Ohio what I Will do is raise paychecks\nRepublican Mike DeWine as promised he won't raise taxes and sat in that debate that his opponent will\nIf you total up all the money that Richard says he's going to spin there's absolutely no way that you could do this without raising taxes is the phone to clear it was even wash washing raise taxes if you look at look at some of the comments also that he has made about that\nDo mine also plans to spend a lot in some areas including the economy his campaign released what it called it's prosperity planned this summer which the wind said as bold aggressive and cutting edge or\nReinventing job printing were incentivizing new innovators and we're getting rid of needless government regulations under our plan we are going to quickly trained a skilled workforce of the future that Ohio's businesses need\nTo mine says his plan will establish regional job training partnerships among the Seventy five training programs across twelve state agency\nAnd also push for more federal block grants for job training create an apt to match employers and potential workers fun ten thousand industry certifications each year and halt regulations that hurt business\nAnd some two million Ohioans will lock the training they need to fill current jobs he says his better skills better jobs plan is centered more on workers and employers\nWorkforce development or has not put enough emphasis on getting people the skills they need to fill the jobs have been focused on helping employers find employees employees haven't developed skills\nNeeded than it really isn't helping employers builders petitions and it's not helping people get the opportunities that they want\nCordray also wants more federal funding for job training and says he'll promote other educational choices along with college and he also wants to base hiring for government jobs on more than just educational requirements\nAs forward to winds plan Cordray sat at that final debate in Cleveland that unlike his own proposal his opponents plan will only help those who are already prosperous\nI mean how can you grow the economy without talking about small businesses and supporting them\nHow can you talking about growing the economy without investing in the infrastructure that we know has been deferred across the state including access to broadband and economic development issue in big pieces of the state and investing public transit so people can get from home to work twenty seven counties have no public transit\nCordray has said he'll go to voters with when he caught a significant bond financing package for public transit infrastructure repairs and expanding broadband meanwhile to wine is pointing to a key part of his plan opportunities zones designated across Ohio and the federal tax bill passed last year\nWe will double down on that what we will do say that we will have that same ... opportunity for people what that means is this going to be more investment just going to be made with there's enough government investment to invest in all our areas in the state of why we have to have private it's going to put money into those areas\nTechnology has become a big part of any discussion on it\nRural residents joins campaign hasn't detailed plans to expand broadband throughout the state though he has talked up incorporating ideas such as autonomous vehicles and block change

separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor we're actually seeing sort of ...\nWell they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall from MIT [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word they ... they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient

if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have

stay focused to get work done learned more it go to meeting dot com\nAnd from the sustaining members of this NPR station\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all empty the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past\nCannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nBe crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's crystal clear at the situation is here\nLegally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws\nWith what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened\nNPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking like somebody's trying to get in and the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for when last\nDoors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a long time or emergency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is old generation\nYou to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damaged it pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that storm back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher load climate or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team\nWhat can you repeat it ... it is way the way she did not\nRealtors homebuilders the insurance industry and many others will all have a voice as Florida considers how to prepare the panhandle for the next storm like hurricane Michael ...
