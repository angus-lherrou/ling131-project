stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in\nApril a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um made a claim that\nDemocrats were somehow behind the caravan\nThey wanted the terror of it and there are those the caravan didn't just shop and it didn't just happen a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue ah

twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans in the midterms\nUh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced uh within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters or she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nAnd I wonder if this election supposed to be about the Republican tax cut which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically

independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access\nTo the consulate they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly\nI think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work could show she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago he said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's at the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel\nKind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find of\nCourse they could ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that\nThe Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S\nEvidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to the states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution\nThat was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people

this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as a people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for\nTen years from now this sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing I'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is what I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC and the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection a study to see on the ballot and its Doug do she's agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt was the ads to approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for the is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nUnder that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust\nMannix here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to

migrants now\nDecided they were going to march grids that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they would try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but you know for him just try to summarize quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence block\nMexico Mexico hits close to a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots or that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut\nAgain um it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nDon't see them up for it ... or whatever but among [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here down it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still writes here or near the bridge and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people\nMostly people who are really the hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the Koch now he's probably four years old has a\nHas a cold rag on his head so Guatemala ... are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the class with Mexican and\nDid you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers\nThe clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to disclose to everyone a show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we are not going home\nIn a second we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware of that a Trump does not want to let them into the country for what they say over and over again as we know that his stance but we're asking we're pleading for help because you know whatever Trump puts in front of us what in fact at home is worse than whatever Trump can put in front of us [noise]\nThank you that is James Frederick reporting from Guatemala Mexico

they want to have the opportunity to complete the investigation going to throw away\nAnd he called that an incredible success\nI'm guessing there were some follow up questions among the press corps on the flight home as you all are headed back you flew back Wednesday from Ankara back to Washington After this mission that was not to find out the facts of what happened you land a and then the next thing we hear from the administration is we need to give ... more time\nThat's right and and he did say that on the on the trip as well because we asked him about the optics of this um that it looks like business as usual with the Saudis and he insisted that he had very direct conversations that they were serious but he also went into this long kind of an prompted defense of the relationship\nI Do think it's important that every one keeping their mind that we have lots of important\nRelationships an actual relationships between us and Saudi company\nSanctions on Iran they need the Saudis to

the Republican closing argument heading into the midterm elections to this\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of job but it all\nThe power of the law and order and common sense that's what it's going to do\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now a big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why President Trump talking about another caravan at a political rally you think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in April\nA this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um made a claim that Democrats were somehow\nBehind the caravan\nWhat they want to the ... and there are those the caravan didn't just shop and it didn't just happen a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to the Mexican government because they're so good hopefully before it ever [noise]\nShould underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally\nThat are out a defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans\nIntimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play\nIllegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters and she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nI Wonder if this election supposed to be about the Republican tax cut which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now an immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border

Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right\nEach because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [laughter]\n[noise]\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out

sense more more metal ...\n... people out you know\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently just agree with the parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nHeard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you seem to accuse been separated from the families of the water\nThere is a reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJews have Garcia heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty eight team could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\n\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera\nHave any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support I'm Hispanic so they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district se knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some of the time I was telling you they're almost the Republican running for reelection I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is a ... show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nIt are immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her narrow if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is that I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of or soda I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug juicy on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think so\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security that we need to stop them\nWe need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juicy\nBut under that logic it Republicans want to appeal hearty why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way she does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treated us in\nFilm IQ if you've got to vote you got to vote you got to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go where they were over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a

to take any credit for it it sounds like\nThey're ... you know trying to blame lower level people ...\nTo to the point that Robin Wright just made how much confidence should we have in this version of events um given that it is a completely different version of events from the one that the Saudis have been sticking to before\nYeah you have to remember that they said that ... left the consulate\nI'm so they totally denied any knowledge of it\nUm I was just there a with secretary of state Mike Pompeo we went to um uh both Saudi Arabia and to um to turkey to grow\nAnd you know ... ... at the time

of migrants fleeing Central America for refuge in the United states have been mass and where today they broke through an immigration barrier and tried to enter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to drive the migrants back\nPresident Trump has already weighed in he's think Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to\nThese migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James an early so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nUh this group of migrants that has now grown to thousands we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at this fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala that got through that sends thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico hit close to a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for the caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using it in for migrants and then the gate shut again [noise] um it was a really chaotic scene\nFor catering or what is it okay for people with among [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here down it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still right here near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far\nHave drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of hot or from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really just hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cutting hours probably four years old has a\nHas a cold rag on his head so bottom on authorities are trying to treat people who they accept suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the class with Mexican and\nAs you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them in\nAs asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to lead the Brits were going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to it's close to every one\nA show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going home\n... seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance\nTrump does not want to let them into the country for what they say over and over again as we know that that's what we're asking we're pleading for help and it shows you know whatever Trump what's in front of us what in
