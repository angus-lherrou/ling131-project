we know if the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly what\nWe're not sure about that but he certainly is offering an alternative theory of the case although he did not explain how road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and um\nKilled somebody in there but I think you see that his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times that the king flatly denied it he firmly denied it and we've seen this pattern before when he took ... quote strong denials that Russia didn't interfere\nIn the twenty sixteen elections he even offered an alternative theory of the case back then when he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on a bed might have hacked the Democrats emails so that's his instinct

disproportionately for minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison walls at rates we estimated

men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor insolence\nThey also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a

president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly with the president is offering\nAn alternative theory of the case although he didn't explain how a group of road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and killed someone but his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times today that the Saudi king flatly firmly denied

few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits\nWomen get this when the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify as smaller infractions\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing endorsed you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room up night then gets takes until late in your case you get written up for that\nThat Victoria Williams and it made up the

you get written up for\nOur number showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying an order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect\nIn Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose bone in visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those math DMV ... says those rules don't work very well with women you walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet some of the day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison Illinois several years ago this was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with President as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women and\nTalk to you they want to talk about their children there when I talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice helped conduct an audit of that women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nAnd the first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in to women we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling\nWhile women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental
