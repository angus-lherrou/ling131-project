know about you but I have not even bother to buying a ticket because I'm a total pessimistic about the lottery I don't even try any more admit I'm actually risk averse only leave any like does anyone think they're really gonna win mathematically speaking the odds are ridiculously against us\nHow ever our next story is about a guy who flipped those odds over and over again here's Alex called American from our planet money podcast\nIt's Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pot was twenty seven million dollars big for the time and when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win\nAnd this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like Kim ... visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of spilling over several million dollars to buy all the share of the largest seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plane was defined Mondale I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific von ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo\nYeah he says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifty ... has a young family and he wants to get out of the country\nI mean you know I live in a factory on fixed you lay among which was good shoes\nDecides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty nice\nCertain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so he pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want seven to ... ... which was about eight years with Charlotte\nRight big score that was on your first try yeah he takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know Syria I Want drove\nEventually Australia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so he sets of sites on the big prizes in America he decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split taught\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in so\nHis secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nI knew that would we want to rise six second Brian I'm going to the ... and ... minded writer\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen

any game one of the twenty Eighteen World Series to talk about this historic match up we reached ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza\nHe Jessica book up outside today [laughter] okay so like\nJust lay off the stage where this battle the he misspoke teams have these huge histories to the biggest fan bases\nHow ethic is it's based off\nWhat's crazy also these teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched game to that game for the Boston Red Sox who they even ... even without ... you might have heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the red Sox not the Yankees that's how far back\n... ... yeah\nAnd they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball teams somehow they miss each other when they've all been in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them two thousand Eighteen so\nWas that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year\nI ... you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got at torn out and there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with this team in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire to get back\nIn when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they went and got many Machado I mean this has been there often said ... he's at shortstop they lost Corey secret during the season so now they have a child and then\nReally is there a ... I Know it's not Clinton ... it's ... so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best picture that we've seen in the national ... they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had definitely Boston is that a lot of reasons to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this team is arguably one of the best\nRegular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want a hundred and eight games yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nAnd you don't get anything oh you get as you want a hundred and eight games yeah they were the warriors they are so good out of it as well you know in the postseason the best teams in always when you got to go out and play\nAll right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win\nGutters and that's going to shop a lot of people because the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there's nobody better but what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care throw the numbers out yet is redemption it's passion it's it's

opportunities\nSo we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody yeah that's the question\nRight or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nI Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent you even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we'll we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has report it\nTo the parents we are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the farm we will find the one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks

their way through Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan he was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof of that class\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country than Tom not letting them in\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty four for ... or from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nOr there's no evidence then as Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear and his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n\n\nSense [noise]\nDesert on

cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night already but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nHow whatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election\nAnd what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming

has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\n[noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes were\nWell that are being perch from the rolls [noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest\nLaws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we are talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place [noise]\n... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank

the tickets\nWe want Seventy two thousand shutdown that made you lay which was about a few years with Charlotte\nAlright big score that was on your first try yeah he takes the money and he leaves

million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of

not the Yankees that's how far back\n... this go okay well yeah\nAnd they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic matchup it's something that in the modern day of two very big

thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case of doctors gotta torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world

of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott I already first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof of that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them it\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with a caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group ah there's\nIllegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n\nThe\n[noise]\nThe third on that Leslie was that tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe ... is not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night already but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nWe're going to put it in a ... percent\nTax cuts for middle income families is going to\nDo whatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election\nAnd what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming weeks\nBut this appears to be a bit of political vapor where that's just time for the election and a tacit admission to the actual tax cut the Republicans passed last year isn't selling very well\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from capital one offering

considered ... and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of an why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or or\nI've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted into into recycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort and we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling his voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id\nThe law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed her very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place
