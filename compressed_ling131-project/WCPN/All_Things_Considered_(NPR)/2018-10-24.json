Chang\nAnd act of terror that is what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is calling a suspicious package sent to CNN in New York\nStudios were evacuated this morning because of that package which was reportedly addressed a former CIA director John Brennan that CNN was not the only target authorities discovered a number of suspicious packages including when's sent to Hillary Clinton\nAnd former president of Iraq Obama they came on the heels of another suspicious package sent a billionaire George Soros earlier in the week\nNPR's Ryan Lucas has been following all of these developments and joins us now he Ryan or other\nOK so a lot of moving parts here all day where do things stand now what do we now\nAt this point in time authorities are talking about uh six suspicious packages and total a one was addressed to Clinton at her home in New York another to Obama here in Washington DC the secret service intercepted both of those during routine screening overnight there were identified as time has\nPotential explosive devices and then this morning a third suspicious package with such CNN's office in New York City right or on the border of Central Park that one was addressed to Brennan who of course was Obama's CIA director uh CNN evacuated the building a NYPD take off the streets called in the bomb squad or the packages contain and taken away\nRight okay so those packages you get described are the ones grabbing the headlines but there were more packages that we know about tell us about\nWell another suspicious package was set to Obama's former attorney general Eric ...\nCongresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz Florida a law enforcement officials are at her office in Florida dealing with a suspicious package there\nUS Capitol police say they intercepted another package that was addressed to democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters are and then remember today's packages have as you've said these if not the first time that we've seen this this week on Monday the potential explosive device was discovered at the home of George Soros who of course billionaire investor big supporter of democratic costs\nUs right so what are authorities saying in ... in these packages\nWell a senior law enforcement official in New York described it devices pipe bombs\nI said that they a device sent a Soros was nearly identical to the one cent to Clinton and Obama a we know the most at this point about the package that was sent to CNN officials say it contained a potential explosive devices and a a suspicious white powder that hasn't been identified young law enforcement officials that I've spoken with\nThey did not have any information about other packages containing white powder so it seems at this point in time only the one that sent to CNN did I'm now all of these potential explosive devices are being sent to the FBI for analysis and the powder as as well\nTo the connection between all these package is at least on the surface is that the people targeted are all high profile Democrats how what are authorities saying about that link\nIt certainly is the link on the surface that we can all look at and say yeah these are all Democrats uh as far as investigators are saying at this point in time or they don't want to talk about what the investigation looks like and what that might mean\nIt's very early they want to get all the packages into the lab take a look at them see what the similarities are um\nNew York's democratic mayor and governor however have addressed this issue they both called for a cooling of political rhetoric or that the tensions need to be taken down a bit um senior ... senior Republicans in Congress did as well including Congressman Steve skull lease remembers release was shot last

station\n[noise] this is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ailsa Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America in and you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley\nYou know pick up a player bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think\nOf mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home because my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAnd she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school\nUs drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms with a mental\nHealth resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to wall\n... all the kids in the school had to write positive messages and about what a good friend [noise]\nOur friend is help them through tough times lily points up to hers on the crowded wall\nSupporting them and keeping them positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just the point and say what they're going through so they don't feel like it\nReally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope helps strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing it what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in\nIn the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work so it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this\nYeah as of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like schools husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing the things that need to change\nKids are catalyst to change Morris says you start there and hopefully the community will follow Kirk Siegler NPR News Grand

that these envelopes were addressed to George Soros he's a billionaire big contributor to democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan the package that was intended for Brennan was sent to CNN's New York office right on not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however a package of didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives\nAnother was California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nUS Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her they say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI\nRight now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package\nA doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late I'm not clear at this point but the FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that uh it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know about at this point\nSo what do we know about the five packages that the FBI discussed in its announcement or there\nWas a law enforcement official described him as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the one set the CNN or the package also is said to have contained to white powder now the FBI itself says that all of the explosive devices were mailed and he's identical bubble wrap envelopes the address is on the packs\nEach package had six U.S Postal service stamps although in the one photo of a package that was provided by the FBI doesn't appear as though they were post marked which could mean that in that case or the individual or individuals ah put stance on

rates are high across rural America\nTo help more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide but eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rate NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of a valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there is only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around our whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know picked up by your bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil who's worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nIt's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city\nOne way or another we have in our home because my voice hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program and she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nOf these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training\nAnd lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nFortune ... middle school aged\nAll the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend\nOur friend

strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model when talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboos\nIt cuts to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing it what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines some confidence that this was going to work so it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters in a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer\nIt is with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like sauce husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing things that need to
