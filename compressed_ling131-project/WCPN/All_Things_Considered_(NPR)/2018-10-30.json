this is Ninety points three WC PM from NPR News\nThis is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose has all hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because\nRight now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and\nFlatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico\nNo question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration in this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U. S. is unusual but it is not unique there are over thirty countries that have also have birthright citizenship mostly they are in the western hemisphere including Canada Mexico Brazil Argentina

NPR News this is all\nThings considered ... and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party or post Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around in the ocean and we hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analyst there were sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election I think that the threat was\nBy the women's march I had asked you and that is\nThis is Michelle ... she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump so\nWhite women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms ... believes that one thing\nFor granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\nIt ... it can be as far away from family we show what is\nWhat is the last ... wife oh well you\nKnow we only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Rebekah Brooks brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election\nCycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to\nAffect their chances of being real known as black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nLike I broke it up religious in the middle of it because I didn't believe all the other police officers say something\nLike well he fits the profile\nDad he sticks to my brother's history there are all dark skin\nTalked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara late right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\nTell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that of insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as a relief to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrats I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's\nAnd we're going to see more and more that\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna

have actually were attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week\nHe's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to

tactic in his immigration crackdown the president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose how dull hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because\nRight now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying well Republican\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nThink it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade\nThrough on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and that this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to all our birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U.

energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living our meetings were happening that night across the country do you do you go around and we did what we think the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wind munching on tacos and commiserate about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nI think the trust was by the women's murdered Iraq have not showing up\nFor this is Michelle ... she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nWhite women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nThink our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power this idea\nWhether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\nIt ... it can be as far away from family we show or what is best\nWhen the last ... wife oh well you\nKnow we only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election cycle\nNo one wants to touch

in the profile\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote you have to show up\nThe community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars or\nBeing heard this is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\nWhat are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of\nIt well black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that of insurance companies don't deny coverage\nDisproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and uh that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people

families of those killed inside Pittsburgh's tree of life synagogue began laying their loved ones to rest today the funeral services as of Dr Jerry Rabinowitz dangle Stein and their brothers sea salt and David Rosenthal began a formal period of mourning for the city's Jewish community\nMeanwhile President Trump also visited Pittsburgh despite objections from the city's mayor and some Jewish leaders NPR's Brian Mann is outside the tree of life synagogue where the killings took place on Saturday Hi Brian Hi Ari it tell us about what the president did during\nVisit for the president and the first lady and also Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump for right here at the synagogue it's quiet now are just people are paying respects there're candles led by\nUh the memorial here a while the

the synagogue to presidents\nThere'll be treated there tell us about what happened to the hospital\nRight the president met with all of the six officers wounded while responding to this attack Daniel

the victims ah and and members of their families and or I should say that he also a signed baseballs and and just kind of chatted with some of the officers were there\nAnd during the visit he was accompanied by Israel's ambassador to the U.S Ron during\nThis visit has been controversial uh Pittsburgh mayor was invited to meet with the president and declined what if people they're told you\nYeah this is a a really complicated time for people in the city um there has been a real debate here about whether the president has the right figure to be involved in this period of mourning\nI spoke earlier today with Angela feral who attended one of the funerals in the squirrels hill neighborhood uh and she said she thinks a male ... should have met with the president\nI and I think is a good thing that the ... supporting the president and I think that the mass of the shaking\nAnd I should say that after the president departed I went to one of the protests here ah and spoke with Nathan Siegel he was marching ah and and he says he grew up in the grill hill neighborhood attending the tree of life synagogue\nIt's my home and it's really terrifying and I'm thinking that Trump would have the audacity to a year the year when he has a naval styling constantly fanning the flames of hate he does not speak for me and I don't want him in my community\nSo you're going to hear Ari emotions are are really high I I Do want to say the protesters really made a show of thanking police and other first responders who helped after this attack a so even as they were criticizing the president a lot of people here were calling for unity and healing\nJust briefly there were four funerals today\nI've noticed a lot of anger and horror of what happened here but people are talking about the need for action going forward people talking about voting obviously the mid term elections are coming out there talking about a need for new civility in American politics hoping that some kind of lessons have been learned in this horrible horrible time\n[noise]\nThrough the power of data using pervasive data intelligence Tara data leverage is all relevant data to deliver answers to

wallet credit approval required capital one bank USA Today\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I melted Chang let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either\nRight first what has the special counsel's office that exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped but it did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purported plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR this individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller\nIn Seventy four the individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking at the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting gaining here\nAnd the timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV uh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sixteen uh a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nThe people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend to more than thirty per week NPR's and every item and explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to end\nLast month the usual Atiya found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd Reykjavik appear young I was on the rocks are somehow empty bottles idea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community\nWhen someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child on the phone district or a boy of seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching as the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nAnd the other long shot the boy's father's rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son take him to sleep\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nLonger alternatives from Vermont to be you know you're going to be now you're just here's a worse you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing here will provoke ground ... you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the tears these government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with international crisis group local populations\nForties only care about exploiting the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not have the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even real you know whether they're true your motives of the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city have been staging street protests during which Ebola or sponsors are forced to hunker down\nThat includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone he was had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time he was harbinger changed over the world but I don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the operating zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence in the D. R. C.\nSo it's very unlikely that peacekeepers in the outbreak zone right now the UN's main focus in the ... elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear or you want us to shift its pieces on the trust poured\nAway from the east where he bowl is spreading to other parts of the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBook the longer this goes on we may go to a point where\nWe could move into a more explosive outbreak ...
