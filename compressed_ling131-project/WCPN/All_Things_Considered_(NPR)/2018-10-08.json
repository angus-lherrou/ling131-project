Supreme Court\nBrett Kavanaugh will be on the bench tomorrow when the Supreme Court holds oral arguments he was confirmed over the weekend on a narrow party line vote and today the president told a group of law enforcement officers in Florida that Kavanaugh's rise to the high court gives Republicans a political boost\nAll over the country are really rallies and people are loving that man and loving that yours\nWill have more on how the political battle over canonize affecting the mid term elections in a bad but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley Hey Scott I also have a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shift at the things we'll see over the next few decades potentially\nWill certainly shift according to the right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federalist society and the Heritage Foundation\nA list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't always say about the justice she'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court\nMost famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to Robert to decide how much judicial restraint\nDo you think the very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body it\nIt certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government snapped by partisans in robes rather than an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate also listen to how President Trump described the campaign against Kavanaugh today\nWas a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evils any tufted out we'll tufted out together and I have to think the Republican\nSenators that fought so hard for this because it was an easy\nSo you have the president they're talking about this in very partisan terms his press secretary Sarah Sanders also tweeted over the weekend that instead of six three liberal Supreme Court under Hillary Clinton we now have a five for conservative court under President Trump that's certainly true enough but it doesn't exactly sound like neutral referee just calling balls and strikes\nYou know was already quietly sworn in on Saturday shortly after the Senate confirmed and so what if the purpose of tonight's ceremony to like\nThis is a chance for the president to remind his supporters who is responsible for this choice or an out in less than two years Trump is named too conservative justices to the Supreme Court\nAnd he's put dozens of conservatives are judges elsewhere on the federal bench so that more than anything has Indira Donald Trump to social conservatives

political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posed with really linked the almost like a scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response than like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now still does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has this country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day\nOf everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it I think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out and she didn't say but those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her\nSexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she

recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there hasn't been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal this\nImages so that crazy facial expression or that you know a change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color\nMuch more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate labels and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh\nThe answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question\nSo easily win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understand\nUm that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are Alice O'Toole is head of the

the job of attorney general I Will fight each and every single day for the children of the state of Ohio\nOur goal is that every child in the state no matter where they're born who their parents or what their situation is they ought to have a shot at the American dream and I will do everything in my power to make sure that that happens we'll start with early childhood development\nIt's important for every child to reach kindergarten\nAnd reach their shows there at the starting line and if you look at our plans on Mike DeWine dot coms won't see the whole plan a we have a very ambitious plan in regard to early childhood development something it's never been done to this extent before in the state of Ohio\nAre cursed Centers for we have some great career centers and state of Ohio\nWe will take them to the next level our goal will be for them to be world class or in the best in the world's preparing young people and some maybe not so young of for a great career\nWe also have to keep our college expenses down the costs we see this with with college kids today who are coming out with tremendous debt which is really impacting their lives\nWere and do everything we can do to keep those those costs down\nWhen we talk about the drug problem we have a twelve point plan this realistic it's practical doable and it will make a huge huge difference we start we start with the through twelve education probably the cornerstone of it\nBut we move move from there the drug courts we believe\nTo help people after that treatment as well I look forward to this debate tonight and the opportunity to share more ideas I Would appreciate your vote\nThat's driving\nElection will decide or future so don't misunderstand the issue between us it's not personal for me it's bigger than that it's about all of us and how we can move forward together\nThe governorship is not a gold watch to be given to whoever has been around the longest Mike DeWine has had a long run but on key issues he's moved Ohio backwards\nOn consumer protection he has not stopped the insurance companies and the drug companies from hiking or health costs too among the highest in the nation on law enforcement he was in charge as a ... became the worst state in the nation for opioid deaths other than West Virginia\nIn Washington he back to big business agenda that ultimately broke the economy tax cuts for the rich letting Wall Street run wild and trade deals that both Sherrod Brown and Donald Trump have said we're the worst ever\nWe need new leadership to move forward Betty Sutton than I Know we can do better here's how\nWill take on the big drug companies and greedy middlemen to bring down health care costs\nAnd we will make sure that no one loses their coverage because of a pre existing condition\nWe will put in place drug policies that are tough\nAnd smart that will crack down on drug dealers take out ... from Ohio and provide more treatment to beat the opioid crisis will create an economy that works not just for some at the top but for all of us with pathways to the middle class for everyone who's willing to work hard\nMike you've had your chance for forty two years it's time you stepped aside and it's time for Ohioans to step into our future\nSo the same special interest to bankroll his campaigns and I will always always stand up for the people of Ohio\nThank you\nAll right questions the first question is to you Mr line yet Ninety seconds to respond Mr Carter then has Ninety seconds and then you have thirty seconds for about ... both said that you would work to protect Ohio in for free existing conditions and that you support Medicaid expansion you've also said you want changes such as work requirements\nIf they're forty characters repealed what specifically could you even do is governor to protect Ohioans with preexisting conditions and with regard to Medicaid expansion Center for community solutions says Ninety six percent of people would be exempt from work requirements\nTurn first of all I have always supported coverage of people who have pre existing illness how in the world that you have a family as big as we have and and not understand that some medical problems that people have today Mr program continues to run these ads that say I don't and he knows better than that you know they're not rich you know better than\n... not once twice three times seven different times I voted in favor\nOf of covering preexisting when I was in the United States Congress in one of those\nMany several those were the were the very bills or underline so let's say that Obamacare does does go way of\nWe still have ... we still have the federal law in fact as far as coverage if we wanted to improve upon that we can do what other states have done with a high risk pool which had thirty five states that did that in the past so those are all things that certainly that we we could do as far as Medicaid expansion\nWe just do have a world of difference of agreement\nUm we're both for Medicaid expansion I think we need to be work requirement of work requirement is not punitive in any way but it's whether to try to get people back into the game help them who those who have a addiction problem or those who do not have the ...\nI think the uh issue on preexisting conditions\nI wasn't paying attention to anything he says tonight because we have a record of eight years of what he's done\nOn this issue there is only ever been one law in this country that protected people with preexisting conditions and it was the Affordable CARE Act everything else he talks about was ineffective to protect people in that situation as shown by the fact that we had to have the Affordable CARE Act in two thousand tent and ever since\nMike DeWine has been flatly opposed to it on his first day in office he\nFiled a lawsuit to set it aside in its entirety if he had his way people in Ohio four point eight million Ohioans with preexisting conditions would not have protection today and if he had his way we never would have had the Medicaid expansion in Ohio because his lawsuit would have wiped it out all across the country\nFortunately he failed but taking taxpayer dollars to try to take away health care for people that wasn't a wine double cross and taking taxpayer dollars to try to wipe out Medicaid expansion which has done so well under governor cases in this state that was another the wine double cross now\nWhy has he done ... says why would I Do this he's got two and a half a million dollars over his career from drug companies and insurance companies maybe that's why they sided with him and that lawsuit it would have felt good to be able to drop people off the rules just when they became expensive we knew he was going to say this tonight so we're releasing a letter tonight\nUnder Mike DeWine signatures first day in office where he tried to set aside the Affordable CARE Act in pre existing conditions in its entirety it'll be on our website at Cordray for Ohio dot com that's you know you have thirty seconds\nTo do their homework because they don't have access in their home and we will make sure that the companies in Ohio do provide broadband access we will make sure we fill in that map of the state that is something I'm pledged to do as governor and that will help us it'll help farmers who use Internet to deal with\nPricing and all the complications they deal with with their crops it will help us all over the state as to why\nHave a great opportunity in this state and the next few years in regard to broadband um we're highways go\nOh with private companies give them the opportunity to come in\nLay the fiber down so that we can reach every single part of the state of Ohio and it's it is essential that we do that and we need to use that is really really an opportunity if you look at the education plant that we have one things that we talk about is we're going to help schools\nAnd teachers have

grams it will be a misdemeanor nope no jail time of all every state around us is a felony where do you think the drug dealers are gonna come Richard they're going to come right here in the state of Ohio and anybody who lives close to the border but or get out of the way because they're they're coming in nobody ...\nThirty seconds so on broadband he didn't do anything when Donald Trump's FCC took net neutrality away he wouldn't stand up to them now he promised who she is going to bring it let's talk about fentanyl my\nSentinel has exploded on your watch the substance abuse monitoring network reports said law enforcement reports that drug cartels have flooded are state with Fenton all over the last several years on your watch Fenton will just went from Seventy year understand this from Seventy a year to three thousand four hundred and thirty one last year\nDrug dealers have had a playground in Ohio while you've been asleep at the switch you've been the ... failure\nI have enough people to fill their available jobs\nOne of the biggest underutilized pools of potential hires in the states are restored citizens ex offenders\nMen and women with criminal records who've paid their debt to society and just won an opportunity to make a living but many businesses are still reluctant to hire them if you are elected governor what would you do to change the employer minds to get more of these people hire\nJury you're already seen some employers change their mind because of the fact that can't find people\nAre but the governor has to lead and I will lead in this area the governor and needs to be\nHolding up programs that we're we're programs and the state of Ohio for businesses have started and everyone in there is a is an ex felon uh every one is in there's been a convicted felon wherever other businesses that are expanding that so we we need to talk about that\nYou need to use the bully pulpit to the office of of the governor to do that we've had some reforms of the legislature has passed in the last few years in regard to what records can be available\nWe want to encourage people to hire a convicted felon at the same time we want to make sure that that is inappropriate position for example we would not want to change the law and the state of Ohio to say that the criminal record of someone\nWould not be available in regard to if they were a sex offender he would not want a sex offender being hired you would want a nursery school to know that we have to be my only point is we have to be very careful in how how we do this but there was a governor can lead there are many businesses that are doing that\nYou're absolutely right the number one complaint I hear when I travel around the state of Ohio is we can't find people to work um I'll talk in a moment of shit red lights on both talk a little bit more in regard to things that we want to do and plans about\nA quarter I noticed that so Mike DeWine says that Governor could lead so could attorney general lead\nAnd his allies in the legislature have done nothing on this\nOr we will have a hard time with criminal justice reform the way he's demagogue ing issue one you'd think issue one was the only issue in this race there's many issues in this race I have said that the one thing we can't do is doubled down on failure with Mike the winds sentinel an opioid crisis that has blown up on his watch\nIssue one is one possible answer I supported the Athens County prosecutors put forward a plan I supported the Franklin County prosecutor in city attorney in Columbus friends of mine put forward a plan I support it what I don't support is doubling down on failure with Mike DeWine reentry has been an issue for years\nOn end in Ohio we've made no real progress on it\nOther than governor cases has done a few things we also need bale reform in Ohio\nWe need to think about individualized determinations of who's being held in jail that's something we need to do in the state\nI Will push for criminal justice reform but Mike DeWine is setting up a climate where nobody will touch criminal justice reform and it's the wrong path thrive it's too expensive to imprison everybody it is to to inhumane to put drug\nOffenders with a drug problem in the prisons where they get no treatment and they come up with the felony on the record they can't get a job I Can't get a license can't get a student loan\nIt's a bad path for Ohio and we need to change\nThe starting line thirty second term about\nRichard\nWe could have some reform [noise] but issue one is a\nTotal disaster and I continue to bring it up because to me it shows a lack of judgment it shows a lack of a good decision making when you're lonely out they're all pretty much all by yourself\nIn addition to the things I said a moment ago what's been a real success is been or drug courts this will destroy or drug courts\nThey're no longer will be a penalty they're nothing hanging over anybody said California did it and they lost sixty percent\nIn several parts of the state including here in Cleveland what would you do to help skeptical Ohio and especially people of color have more faith in law enforcement\nBut I think first of all we could work on things like criminal justice reform he says we could have some reform we haven't had any while he's attorney general certainly doesn't deserve a promotion\nUh on that issue that we also need people to understand that we need to fare policing and that comes about to proper training or right when the Tamir Rice tragedy occurred in Cleveland Mike DeWine response was to say we need more police training but what has he done\nYou know how much police training they're paying for this year in the attorney general's office\nIs zero hours zero hours so that's a promise that was made that hasn't been kept his budget is forty million dollars higher this year than it was last year\nZero hours for police training our law enforcement need that training\nThis is probably one of the reasons why law enforcement in this state or indoor seeing me not Mike DeWine in the governor's race because they know that when it comes to being tough and effective on crime he hasn't delivered both the fraternal order police and the ... association has endorsed rich Cordray and the governor's race\nBecause I Will take on the opioid crisis we will Dr Fenton a lot of Ohio federal has run wild on his watch in Ohio and it's pretty precious for him to talk about what we need to do\nAbout fentanyl misrepresenting issue one which has nothing to do with drug trafficking was anybody was Nineteen grams of fat no we'll be prosecuted in jail under my watch has been drug trafficker\nIn Ohio but Mike DeWine has failed us on this issue he's failed us on police training and he's failed us across the board which again is white law enforcement supports me in this race not you like I Would enjoy line\nI wouldn't let anyone who's watching tonight to talk to your local county prosecuting attorney and to ask them whether someone who is in possession of drugs which takes the sentinel let's say it's Nineteen grams\nNever been accounted prosecuting attorney and you don't know anything about it and you're dead wrong if you talk to prosecuting attorneys what they will tell you is there is no place to go and so that person wouldn't Nineteen grams enough to kill ten thousand\nIs that funny ten thousand people it's laughable your final ten thousand people Richard they will get no jail time\nIt will kill our drug courts it's horrible the other thing let me let me talk for a moment about what we the group that we put together we put Fifteen people together it was should issues from throughout the state of Ohio\nThey came back with some amazing recommendations that we implemented are now part of the core curriculum things such as how you determine if someone\nAs autistic someone as a mental might have a mental health problem that is a life and death thing we're teaching that now\nImplicit bias something that every police officer should understand what their biases are dishes revolutionary we did it by putting assistance group together I'm very very proud of what they've done\nIt ... for about anybody with enough ... till ten thousand people needs to be prosecuted for drug trafficking and they would be Mike you just got that wrong and the newspapers have said that claim on your part is an outright lie", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "08"}
