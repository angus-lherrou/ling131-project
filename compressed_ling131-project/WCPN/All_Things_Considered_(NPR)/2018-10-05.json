already just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speeches a kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically we're saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that and she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a fallen confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there while she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her well she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear

something may have happened to forward and ah Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault but she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh's who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief in the presumption of innocence and she spoke about that quite a bit um and

so these are not he said she quit she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to know\nHim well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nThat that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an\nThe way he acted like an atomic ...\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interviewed well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice forward\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question\nThat she found the tactics of some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee to be appropriate but when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment in his\nSome of his testimony he uh he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and sorting gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not faulted for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're

the women were all than a simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that\nThis reckoning only continues and grows bigger let me ask you this it if Kavanaugh is confirmed with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nThink if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that what especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table\nRight she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also saw moments like with um the two protesters

people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing can happen between now and that it happened you know we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA role that he might have had to play had it had it not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins as she laid out her position and the links for speech has already just said a didn't appear to have been under\nThe kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically we're saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that and she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there while she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her well she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew what was coming\nTo me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault yeah she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and ah Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nBut she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through it and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh's who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief in the presumption

moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described ...
