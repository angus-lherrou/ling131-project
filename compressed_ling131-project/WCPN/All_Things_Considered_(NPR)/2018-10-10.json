U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect is as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence gained it with these ... they weren't ... what\nMy sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person is a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talked to reporters like you were I I think there's a real\nConcern on two fronts one that this was a journalist\nAbout that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On\nA hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced the sort of ousted and I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people and the White House in the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely Jerry ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there was a personal bond there that is translating into policy\nThat's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hope for the weekend or overturn roe the wait at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports that Supreme\nCourt can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade\nThe justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same game on private planes headed for Cairo and by\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's let's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect is as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay Hans Augusto ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I\nThe plan B or for that descend these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these ... they weren't ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin ... or who to be Frank is not really viewed as a bay trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard and they he replaced that he sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia when\nYou talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about that\nSometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\nOf the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...
