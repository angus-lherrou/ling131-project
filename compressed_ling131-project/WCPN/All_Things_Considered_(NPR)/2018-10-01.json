depends on when the FBI concludes its investigation into claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were both teenagers Kavanaugh ... denies the claims\nThe scope of the investigation is unclear and has been the subject of political haggling ever since the inquiry was announced on friday NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest I've got a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today what did he say about having on where this investigation stance\nHe said a lot about cabinet but let's just focus for this moment on what he said about the investigation and Kavanaugh we had been hearing a lot of reports that the White House had been ordering the FBI to keep the focus very narrow President Trump today insisted that is not the case\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nAnd we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about this Jeff Flake is the Arizona senator who forced this week long investigation on friday he said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts here\nThe Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and\nDefine current incredible Lindsey Graham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all of the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party and it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party\nHere's the thing that's unclear it's whether the FBI could or would broaden and talked to college classmates who have come forward saying that cabinet wasn't telling the truth when he testified about his drinking habits and other things like that\nA flake was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants the scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually leads to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them in the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence\nThat undermines what what Ford said and backs what Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell\nSaying that based on the lack of hard evidence a regional ... prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh at this point how\nMuch control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process well here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they want it to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThey didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward with this\nAnd you have to wait for those votes those three Republicans have a lot of power right now and that's why this moment in sixty minutes interview was so important\nTo judge

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro it looks like North America will remain a free trade zone after all late last night Canada agree to joined the U.S and Mexico in an updated version of the north American free trade agreement it will no longer be called NAFTA but rather the U. S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump's celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal from called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nWants approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country where the most advanced protections for workers ever developed in ...\nTo opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBut Canada is still expected to buy more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U. S. agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade dispute even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partners ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico have reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left Canada on the sidelines has been averted\nWhat I can say is that free and fair trade in North America is in a much more stable place than it was yesterday\nMarkets rallied on the news with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly two hundred points Trump Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to sign the deal within sixty days just before Pena Nieto leaves office it will then be up to the incoming U.S Congress to decide whether to approve the agreement\nThe president's trade representative Robert Lighthizer says\n... says while she still has a lot of questions about the fine print the administration has been attentive to the concerns of organized labor\nWhatever else is going on in other parts of the administration and the answer Lighthizer has and very serious about listening to our ideas and wanting that support of working families\nWhite House aides or the new deal is a vindication of the president's hard nosed negotiating tactics which included stiff tariffs on us allies and the threat of even harsher protectionist measures\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the library of Congress with the national library service

NPR News this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro\nThere have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lowered down the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them and\nWhat does that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about so\nDepartment of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up as boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyist who was they're mainly to\nRoot out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves and and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the\nWhat they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active\nOpposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades gotten extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of

congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest Hi Scott made good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today what did he say about having on this investigation stance he said a lot about Kavanaugh but\nLet's just focus for this moment on what he said about the investigation and cabinet ... we had been hearing a lot of reports that the White House had been ordering the FBI to keep the focus very narrow President Trump today insisted that is not the case\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive ah\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nAnd we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about this Jeff Flake is the Arizona senator who forced this week long investigation on friday he said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts\nHere the Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and credible allegations President Trump seems to be referring to Santa Republicans on this so what's our best understanding of how the Senate Republicans define current incredible\nLindsey Graham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all of the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party\nAnd it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party here's the thing that's unclear is whether the FBI could or would broaden and talked to college classmates who have come forward saying that cabinet wasn't telling the truth when he testified about his drinking habits\nTo have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out what we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them in the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence\nOr that undermines what what Ford said and backs what Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from the prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell\nSaying that based on the lack of hard evidence of regional prop prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh at this point how\nMuch control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process well here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they want it to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThey didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward with this\nAnd you have to wait for those votes those three Republicans have a lot

judges\nAnd he walked me through how he would go about\nThis one if he were on the team investigating Kevin\nFirst I Would spend a lot of time trying to locate the home perhaps Dr Ford to ride around with agents we don't have much time you know we have to do it quickly if we can limit the neighborhood or the general area and we might be able to find the house\nThey're also real estate records available to the FBI would investigate\nLet me just start with the first example you would actually have Christine Blasey Ford in a card with you and just drive around the neighborhood and see if that jobs her memory to point out to have I actually would also\nAnd you would try to look for what you said floor plans of houses in the neighborhood yeah matched the description from her memory\nI Would in her memory is there is a living room right inside the front door stairway up to a bedroom on one side and the bathroom across the hallway we're looking for that\n[noise] what else would you do judge Kavanaugh offered some written calendars from his high school years what would you do with those calendars\nOur interview everyone on much calendar and the crucial time period is summer middle of the summer or so July Nineteen eighty\nAnd we graph of all three people involved in the alleged sexual assault judge Kavanaugh mark judge and a doctor for you good polygraph all three of them\nOkay there are allegations that involve cabinets behavior while under the influence of alcohol on during his younger years is it relevant would it be relevant to you if you are on this investigation to do a thorough pro of his drinking habits in high school and in college [noise]\nYes else in this instance not in all I Would want to interview him extensively about his drinking habits high school college and law school I Would want that on the interview\nDo you think the FBI in one week can turn up information that has not already been turned up by Senate staffers who have gifted background investigation cannot what tell me why do\nI I Do because of the training the FBI gets re or while the staffers are good people and they work hard at backgrounds the FBI does this as its mandate we do it all over the country frequently and the agents assigned this case agents\nOn background or will train have done it many times\nAnd it turns out the FBI finds information that raises questions about the fitness of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on a Supreme Court does he have a responsibility to pursue those additional leads\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case agent I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and unlimited scope according to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth with those additional interviews\nDo you think the idea has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't uh at the forefront at the beginning\nThink the FBI could request\nInducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the quest Jack ... is a former FBI agent thank you very much oh You're welcome Elsa thank you\n[noise]\n\nThe Trump Administration is touting new trade deal with Mexico and Canada replacing NAFTA the new deal will be called the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nFor a first take I called Ohio State university economist Ned Hill and asked him if this is just NAFTA by another name and he said no\nYou know after it was an old agreement and needed some work and some of that took place here if it hugely transformational no but we have to remember that Ohio is the single largest\nImporter of goods that are targeted by Canada's retaliatory kit are targets to the United states steel and aluminum getting closer to having good trade relations is important even though this agreement doesn't touch the steel and aluminum agreement\nAnd the United steelworkers pointed that out how big a deal is that that the terrorists aren't touched\nThe single most important\nComment that came out of the Post's raving last night was the new agreement will include provisions in three areas that will become the template for the new Trump Administration playbook for future trade deals some of the most important changes have nothing to do with our relationship cannot Mexico ... with\nChina because they in their included language to directly address our issues on intellectual property and ownership or the other things with China so in some ways this is sending out a template for world administration thinks bilateral negotiations going to go\nSo we would be treating our allies in North America at the same way that that perhaps negotiations could go with China where the rhetoric has been a lot different\nExactly and ... and it lays out the road map and these are not big issues with Canada and Mexico with huge issues with China second it doesn't deal with the steel and aluminum tariffs if not offended agreement they keep on saying that's a completely separate track that may\nGive the administration\nYou know something of a few days or weeks from now to say we're good buddies and with us taking care of\nThe third is it there is a side agreement when it comes to autos and that actually is will give the recipe I Believe what happens we'll steel and aluminum because it's very closely resembles which feel\nExemptions that were carved out for Brazil Argentina and Australia basically what it does it says the current lower level tariffs will apply to the products up to a certain\nVolume of imports whether it's units or weight and I'm only above that will the new tariffs kick in\nThere were two comments from the administration that I'd like your your take on here are obviously they're they're selling this as a victory um by the two things were that this is a deal based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nAnd secondly it will send cash in jobs pouring into the U.S and North America what do you think of those\nPart a I think it's correct that there was much more give\nBy the United states than the initial posturing in the intellectual property rights protections neither signals to China or were important most important I think um the next component which there isn't it keeps the north American production system together for automobiles\n... of you know all of a sudden and they're going to fall by the fall shows up next awards town and start spending cash out you know we're going to have to see how the details workout before we see what the impacts and then\nWhat more important than whether it's going to be a huge new gusher of a best buy is it prevents and ... lotion of the manufacturing base in the United states in Ohio by carrying all parts of North American production system that's a huge one\nThat's Ned Hill and economist at Ohio State university [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nSupport for Ninety three three WCBS and this provided by\nGreatly
