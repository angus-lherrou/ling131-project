Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there don't remember where was the place I don't remember how many and today the White House\nBriefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nI vote or just the motives very compelling edge over by a woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of ... to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single\nTape and so that has people really upset today some how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote you\nKnow one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted shared\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's on attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nBut how his supporters react\nAnd his supporters by in large seemed to have stuck with him through the allegations against him even if they find those allegations distasteful it remains to be seen exactly how people will respond in the long term to these cabinet allegations\nFor NPR comes from their station and from Amazon Prime video presenting to return of the man in the high castle were America's

credit approval required capital one bank USA Today\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered melted Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro many people in the U.S auto industry are breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd we'll send a senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required for parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs\nOur members and in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum\nAnd we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before that finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be tariffs for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry and not gone away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up the sleaze uses same energy they used to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states is able to pull through was an increase in the U. S. content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America and our vehicles the biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrative cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because\nConsumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nCommunities across the country are grappling with a new kind of chemical pollution in drinking water\nIt's called pee fast a group of thousands of chemicals used for decades and products like ... pants\nThe science and regulation around this still aren't settled leaving some people in limbo New Hampshire Public Radio's Annie Ropeik has the story [noise]\nJillian lanes family built a house and the tree lined cul de sac in the New Hampshire town of ... on a recent morning as she wrangled her three young daughters door she pointed out a picture window for the woods in the back yard\nSo I like\nIt is a federal Superfund site called Coakley landfill lane didn't even know it was there until two years ago when she heard of an nightmarish discovery nearby a cancer cluster of young kids all with the same rare deadly diagnoses lane was desperate to know for girls were risk so she started reading\nUnderneath one of the articles was just a comment from a Public Citizen that set a Coakley question mark and I was like ... or started Googling it\nShe found a former town dumb but turned toxic waste cleanup area just through the woods and the ...

were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel\nHey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of I don't believe that ... they are very well taken care but\nIn border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days and many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border\nUntil the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child and our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da chest said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nGovernment was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nIs blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote da chess does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children who still haven't been reunited with their parents [noise]\nOh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Joe you're walking [noise]\nAd for forty four it's all things considered featuring the sound of applause Ninety points three I'm Tony cancer\nA puzzle book published in Nineteen eighty two set out to spur treasure hunting across the country Byron Price published this secret a treasure hunt containing poems pictures and paintings\nContaining clues to twelve real life boxes buried somewhere to date only two of the boxes had been found one of them right here in Cleveland back in two thousand for\nLocal writer James rent or wanted to go in search of the other boxes and he enlisted his friend film producer Tyler Davidson to make a documentary about it\nThis weekend the secret of Byron Price gets its premier at the chagrin documentary film fest and the two men spoke about it with idea streams damp a letter to James how did you first discover the secret by Byron Price what was the attraction well\nYou know weekly and I remember finding the book in the library this would have been back in Nineteen eighty six in the book came out in eighty two and here's this book full of paintings and poems that lead you to a dozen keys that were buried across the United states\nAnd I remember thinking wow this is such a great idea because at the time ... was out and I really wanted to find some treasure with my friends\nBut then you know this is days before the Internet so there was no way for us to know how many of the treasures had already been found\nAnd so I just assume that you know they had already been claimed so I kind of forgot about it for a while and then working as a reporter at Cleveland's seen a one day opening the plain dealer and here is a story about two lawyers from New Jersey who dug up one and Byron prices keys\nIn the cultural gardens on the east side\nAnd then it said and ten more of them are still out there remaining to be found and then I got the fever again\nSo these two Tonys came here and they figured it out by looking at at the pictures what was the clue the gave it away for the picture treasure buried in Cleveland\nSo in the paintings there are always markers that lead you to the general area the city at least you know\nAnd in this one painting\nThat appears in the book if you look in the branches of the tree and then turn the picture ups town in the negative space there\nIs the outline of the terminal tower and somebody from Cleveland had seen that and then put that clue up in the Internet and these lawyers from New Jersey built off of that first clue and tracked down to the cultural gardens\nThere is an actual for the last box\nWas to the realization of a lifetime it's like one of the top moments in my life other than the birth of my children is like that\nSeems like it's rejuvenated a puzzle ah people like solve puzzles it also gives people a place to go in and congregate and talk about it\nYeah Byron Price was always way ahead of his time you know that was the thing about his life he had these grand ideas but it took everybody a while to catch up so this book really needed the Internet to really catch on\nAnd when the Internet came around and was invented that's when this book really took off\nBut by then those kids have been sitting in the ground for Twenty years so now it's much much harder to track them down\nTime or did you have any knowledge of the secret before you talk to James and decided to actually produce this phone rang I knew nothing of this book or a buyer and price but I did know James James introduced this\nFascinating idea based on this book and James and I are all around the same age and I think we both came of age as\nTeenagers watching movies like Indiana Jones and goon ease and stand by me these quest adventures that I think we were both attracted to and so when he told me about this book and the idea that we could actually get involved in a treasure hunt I jumped up the chance\nIdea Stream stand politically speaking with local rider changed renter and film producer Tyler Davidson about the documentary the secret of Byron Price find out more at applause ...

are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nIf part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about the sort of have a better understanding of what women go through\nThink so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the cabin up for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened

investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today Thanks for having me or\nThe New York times story you just heard it now says that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do sell\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years that doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades to simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively\nAnd years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no with\nOne in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done\nAnd also to the extent the IRS has resources they are not going to be allocating at tort gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nHere's to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a ... on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe us as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on or turn means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can

briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nOr just the motives version of a woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of ... to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to laugh and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape yet and so that has people really upset today some how the response\nHas been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nWell they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote you know one thing that ...\nHe himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct absolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh a Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise laughter cheered\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nBut how his supporters react\nAnd his supporters by and large seemed to have stuck with him through the allegations against him even if they find those allegations distasteful\nIt remains to be seen exactly how people will respond in the long term to these cabinet allegations I mean how much is that breaking down by gender how much have gender dynamics shapes the way people have responded to this

vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court could come as early as friday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell wants it to happen this week though he hasn't scheduled at yet he\nAnd the rest of the Senate or waiting on the FBI to finish its investigation of sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh\nThree Republicans who could determine the judges said say they need to see that at the report first before they make up their minds with this now to talk about the latest as NPR's Scott Detrow who joined us from Capitol Hill Hey Scott pay also\nSenators are saying the FBI could complete this report and send it to them as soon as today which would be early because the FBI was given a full week to do this\nDoes this speed give us any clues about the scope of the report what\nWe got one clue on the scope just just a while earlier today we know now that the FBI has not yet talked to one key witness and that's Christine Blasey Ford her lawyer say as of today she has not been contacted by the FBI\nA lot of top Republicans are fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican as he got into an elevator earlier today\n[noise] I don't know when we heard from ever says of course referring to last week public testimony a Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said something similar\nDemocrats say this makes no sense at the whole point of following up was to confirm or dispel what Ford and Kavanaugh said so the FBI should follow up here's Democrat Richard Blumenthal who's a former attorney general leads are followed\nThe interviews creates additional questions\nGot to be more than just check the box okay we'd have their accounts [noise] okay so clearly there is a big split between Republicans and Democrats are talking about this that split was even more parent last night President Trump spoke at a rally and he mocked Christine Blasey Ford's testimony against cannot let's let's take a listen to a bit of that\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know [noise]\nWe had been saying all along Scott that Kavanaugh's confirmation comes down to a few key Republicans in the Senate how are they responding to what the president said last night\nReally not well Arizona Senator Jeff flake said that what Trump said was kind of a polling\nOf course all along Senate Republicans have distanced themselves from Trump's comments which we send them back to his agenda so the question is whether this time will be any different Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski is one of those other key undecided vote today she indicated maybe it could be [noise]\nI and taking everything into account and I think that the president yesterday marketing director for were wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable for taking\nEverything into account is is the key framing their Murkowski has made it clear she thinks a big part of this is treating women with respect listening tone to them when they come forward with allegations so she is certainly someone to watch if the president keeps attacking Ford head on\nAnd how many of these key senators said anything about the scope of the FBI investigation and whether or not hearing from either Kavanaugh or Ford again is a problem\nFlake said earlier that there should be about knowing what there is to know and trying to answer questions not checking a box as for the very latest little unclear because it's hard to talk to them right now because they're the center of

sexual assault are sharing their stories money for the first\nTime Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox and her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing the column on line that I spoke with Monica has to be about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of\nSurvivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry the someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world as a young woman and so they ...\nFish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things you write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men on comparable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\nYou know it just just think about tropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can never make we do that with ... and we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the response was that you have to call them since it was published this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response drop lose\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her had this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten\nI just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think\nI Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi while so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to\nYou own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell her father is about the sort of have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the cabin up for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago\nAnd I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...
