Kavanaugh's past who has stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination Chad letting and went to Yale with Kavanaugh\nHe says they used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got village\nKavanaugh may have lied under oath Chad letting ten joins me now Hi there how are you man who Hi I'm All right thank you for your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released her statement this past\nSunday I've just summarized it they're so let me straight to what you did with this information you ended your statement saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you did you\nUh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the so usually a committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nIt is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrase is black and yeah I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the blackness\nState of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered to this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like maybe three maybe four to eighty five at your college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and

as the Indians top the central division and head to the third straight postseason game one is tomorrow afternoon in Houston home to the defending World Series chance\nWith more on the tribe is idea strings Glenn forums Hi Glenn Tony how are ya so first of all how are the Indians look in the season it's kind of a strange question it's been a strange season\nFor the Indians they have the least amount of winds of any team in the American league playoffs but they had an injury issues this season and they were never really challenged in that division they essentially play the last month or so knowing if they were already in the playoffs so factors like that it really makes it hard to judge their performance you mentioned the Astros they are the ...\nAre separate season in its own right Terry Frank Conan the manager both a few sort of in his praise for Houston but he also pointed out that the Indians had some success against the Astros\nThey're always fun to play because of the child is they were and they play until it's time to go home so they keep coming at you know so many players so many good pictures and we've played them probably better than most teams\nThat's manager cherry Frank Kona and when the Indians and made a number of moves that she's in trying to stay ready for a playoff run but it's not just about the short term right\nNo never with this front office or some of the moves this season were necessary to improve the team the bullpen was struggling in the middle of the season so they traded for San Diego relief pitchers Brad Hand an Adam similar to help their bullpen but that also prepares for the possible departure of Cody Allen and Andrew Miller and free agency this off season I did ask\nTeam president chrysanthemum anyhow the Indians front office handles that idea of going for it all to win this season versus the long term health of the organization\nThere's no magic answer to that is a constant push and pull part of our responsibilities in the front office is making sure we do the best we can to maximize our chance of winning the world series and that often means weighing short term impact that long term expense\nSo in that trade the Indians had to give up treasured prospect Francisco may he had to get hand and semper both of them are under team control to at least twenty Twenty one so that helped short term and long term the team also picked up Josh Donaldson he's a former league MBP who was coming off a calf injury and he's now their third baseman\nYou mentioned before hand the team injuries have affected the season but last season I remember a bit of concern about manager Terry ... he had a heart\nProcedure how's he doing it seems like he's he's been much better is held has improved he didn't miss any of the one hundred

Mr Mir as gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed you say\nYou should be up there was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI is that they are when they're told that the and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both Mr ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of getting a

season it's kind of a strange question\nIt's been a strange season for the Indians they have the least amount of wins of any team in the American league playoffs but\nThey had an injury issues this season and they were never really challenged in that division they essentially play the last month or so knowing if they were already in the playoffs so\nFactors like that it really makes it hard to judge their performance you mentioned the Astros they are the world series champions the Indian certainly know Houston is very good team\nBut they're taking the approach that not only is this a new season but the playoffs are a separate season and its own right Terry from Conan the manager both a few sort of in his praise for Houston but he also pointed out that the Indians had some success

possible departure of Cody Allen and Andrew Miller and free agency this off season I did ask team president chrysanthemum anyhow the Indians front office handles that idea of going for it all to win this season versus the long term health of the organization\nThere's no magic answer to that is a constant push and pull part of our responsibilities in the front office is making sure we do the best

league MBP who was coming off a calf injury and he is now their third baseman\nYou mentioned before hand the team injuries have affected the season but last season I remember a bit of concern about manager Terry ... he had a heart procedure how's he doing\nIt seems like he's he's been much better is held has improved he didn't miss any of the one hundred sixty two regular season games this year
