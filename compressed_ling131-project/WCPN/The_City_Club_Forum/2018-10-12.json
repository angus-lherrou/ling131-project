{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "So first let me ask you a couple of questions how many of you went to liberal arts colleges\nTo job I'm so let me ask you another question you don't have to answer this question but let me tell you how this question came to our board of trustees so in March of last year we begin doing things that are board meeting called silent start for those of you who are on board she might want to try this\nSo here's what a silent start is you ask the question you pose a question for the board\nAnd you wait five minutes before anyone can speak\nWait five minutes\nThen the goal is not to answer the question the goal is to wipe out all the question\nWait five minutes\nAnd then the first thing you start to do is to say what type of question in this race for you\nSo it is twelve twenty four forty somewhere in the world of child is being born we're overland want that child Eighteen years from now the ... oval in college right so the question before our board was\nEighteen years from now\nWhat type of institutions us over the need to be for that child to choose Oberlin first\nAnd the second part of that question was what type of academic in student life experience needs to be happening in overland for that child to choose\nOverland first I was the question five minutes of silence people start right\nThe floor was open we call them the first board member and this was the first question\nThat that question raised for that board member she said\nEighteen years from now we'll small private colleges exist\nThat's the silver earrings question right and gives you a sense of the profound disruption that we're experiencing if that was the first question that the board member brought up okay we'll we exist Eighteen years from now that was the first question\nSo let's talk a little bit about the disruption so we can get into how we're trying to respond so those of you who um you know we spend time looking at a Moody's and standard and Poor's in us and looking at their ratings right we have to do that at college\nSo you know that several years ago they they changed the outlook for certain segment of colleges from stable the negative right so those were small to wish independents\nAnd then a few years ago they change the outlook for the entire industry literally said the whole industry that outlook is negative\nAnd that was driven a lot by demographics enrollment issues but that was sort of another moment of pause for higher education and particularly for small private liberal arts colleges and places like Oberlin who are very selective highly doubt institutions and yet\nThey're questioning the whole outlook [noise] so let's talk about demographics for a second so I see my Cleveland State folks are saying you guys are going yeah I Know we've heard this before right we're living is so demographics\nThe total number of the sort of size of the number of high school graduates graduating is declining and so the climbing number of high school graduates nationally and it's been sort of stagnant\nFor a while I'm starting to decline and if you look at the out years by the time we get to twenty twenty seven or twenty thirty two there's ingesting it the climb will be so steep\nThat'll be lower than twenty Thirteen level right so if you are an institution that's totally focuses on traditional age college students that is all you got going on\nIt's gonna be pretty tough sledding\nThere isn't the climbing number of students that are available to us\nAnd that's certainly true depending on what state you're in because if you are on a national institution or international institution the way that Oberlin is and your recruiting from all sorts of state there are some states where the decline it's deeper than the national average\nSo I just left Pennsylvania a year ago and the ... and the average there was ten percent deeper that Khan than the national average\nSo we're certainly dealing with that issue the only really increasing student body in the undergraduate room or election next to this so if you're an institution that hasn't been focusing on what um diversity looks like\nWhat it means to have a diverse student body if you only have really white students on your campus in very small diversity numbers it's going to be more and more complicated for you to recruit students so that's a huge industry disruption\nSo let me just say something to the folks who are listening who are who are the selective institutions 'cause this was a ...\nSo if the total number of high school graduates that graduate are about three point eight million goes between three for foreign three point eight\nOf those three point eight or so million two point\nSix of them decide to go to any college right so just they go to college at\nOne point seven\nOf them decide to attend four year institutions\nThen when you ask them about whether they're going to a private institution and you look at that data point that three point eight of the graduates gets down to five hundred and sixty thousand that go to private institution if you need them to have an SAT score to Thirteen fifty or above [noise]\nNumber gets to about eighty nine thousand nationally and need them to have a parental income of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or above\nThen is about twenty thousand students that were competing for that rooster in Kenyan just name all the small private issue on\nThat's what it looks like that's the disruption right going market as adults twenty five to Thirty years old they are peaking and twenty thirty justice we're sort of bothered me now\nThis is so painful for those of us a liberal arts college because we know that it's been a powerful\nEngine this look at where he's almost everybody in this\nRoom raised their hand as a person who attended a liberal arts house so you know the power of this work that we do and you know what it's meant for your own development in your career I'm sure you will talk about your experience is transformative and yet\nYou heard the Pew Research said he said in late July that sixty one percent of Americans say that the system of higher education is going in the wrong direction\nOn the right and wrong track numbers those of you are looking at politics right now we're there saying we're on the wrong track their perspective\nWhen you ask them about their perceptions of the value of a college degree and the quality of a college degree\nThat perception has declined over the past two years when you ask them about their views the liberal arts only forty eight percent have a favorable view of the liberal arts they have strong views around Stillman business\nAnd when you ask them I'll be interested in knowing your answer to this question is when you ask them to measure our success it came down to one word can anybody guess without one word is\nJob look at you all you know what you're talking about jobs right\nWhen you ask them about students that they have a perception that the amount of debt that students take out to go to college is significantly higher than it is so they have the perception that it's about Ninety thousand dollars\nRight over the course of their time but the actual average debt is about thirty two thousand dollars so that the perception that the debt is way larger than it really is and in a place like overland because we meet for me\nRight it's out of whack\nBig disruption\nSo we talk about that but we can't ignore cough so people are talking about our costs and they're concerned about it\nAnd we're concerned about it too and one of the reasons why I was concerned about it is because if you look at tuition room and board a lot of small colleges\nIt's now started to exceed median family income so median family income and twenty Seventeen was sixty one\nThousand dollars and tuition at Oberlin this year is fifty four thousand so if you start to add up room and board and other things than people start to question our cost than we can talk about the reasons\nWhy I'm happy to talk about that afterwards yes we have a high cost model you remember it right small class size those deep connections with faculty those special programs and initiatives that help you think differently about your opportunities\nTrying to respond to this costing here's a small thing that may seem insignificant but it matters to family because each one of these little things we add on books and traveled back to your family and all those things can make it seem like this experience that's not you can't afford it\nSo simple thing that students for the most happy about\nFree laundry just no more quarters everybody right but it's so small things that address cost that makes a difference right new academic programs right so what does it mean to have you know\nA and M. F. A. and creative writing so although that is very much known for creative writing program what might it mean to have a five year MSA program what my didn't mean to also do a portion of it low residency\nTrying to think about it and different types of students what does it mean to collaborate with other institutions right things and in the past\nMay seem like we're all standing on our own and yet we're all seeing that this collaboration\nReal as well\nSo last thing I'll say to him\nSo the truth of the matter is that we can't just narrow down the liberal arts\nCollege experience to career to cause or to all of these things even though that's what the public says they want well we also have to demonstrate is the other part of what the liberal arts provide and for us we think are worth\nIs measuring things to the public says they care about but it's also measured\nAnd meaningful lives well lit\nAnd that's the thing that we think liberal arts colleges provide that sometimes maybe missing right so I'm actually pretty optimistic despite the talent because if you look at what happened to people who went on after their liberal arts college career\nThey literally are out there changing the world for good\nYou've been listening to the city of Cleveland friday foreign to the future and Carmen totally embark president of Oberlin College tune in for one of idea streams expanded broadcasts of this foreign Sunday at ten o'clock on W.

it's here now\nDuring the surprise inspection of California's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new suits made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns the inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart ... report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story pull him a welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new she's made a bed sheets in Fifteen cells\nHow is that possible uh well that's a good\nQuestion you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of were issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from vents and so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency surface needed to be addressed\nShould we imply then that that many people inside the facility were suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those who says\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would on for all the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed at them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempt weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside the building by any means what else did you find\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this\nYears since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a questions of untimely an adequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to uh happened and so when you're using\nDisciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive or that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned that doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth I'm is what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\nImmigration detention is governed by ah what are called his performance space national detention standards and that governs everything about medical care that\nDetainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be timely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who\nAre have no choice but to rely on the care that they're given inside these facilities and in Adelanto in several other government inspection reports over the years again since it opened in two thousand eleven the facility has failed to meet the standards of this is not the first time that that this has been an issue\nWe should point out that I Belong to is owned by a private company the GEO Group and it's it's very very common for the federal government to contract these detention centers out to private companies you mentioned they have a history of problems\nUm what is the companies saying I mean is anybody being held to account for what the inspector general found [noise]\nBut after that they did a send me a statement saying that they took the a report very seriously", "show_name": "The City Club Forum", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "12"}
