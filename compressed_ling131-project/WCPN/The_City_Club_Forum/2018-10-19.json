{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "Unlike racial minorities corporations did have rights the white man was bound to respect\nNow corporations have not only fought for years to win constitutional protections they've also been innovators and civil rights litigation one eye opening and disturbing example came after the civil war in a series of remarkable cases brought by the southern Pacific railroad company\nWhen California imposed a special tax on railroads the southern Pacific assembled an all star team of lawyers led by the illustrious Roscoe ... to fight back\nNo lawyers to play the starring role and all the great ...\nUh rights were really no exception among those who argue for the constitutional rights of corporations over the course of American history including Daniel Webster consider maybe the greatest advocate ever in the history of the Supreme Court argued more than two hundred cases back in the early Eighteen hundreds\nJohn Quincy Adams the sixth president of the United states argue for the rights of corporations and Ted Olson the dean of today is a link Supreme Court bar has argued for corporate rights to unlike traditional civil rights organizations corporations have always had the resources to hire the best most creative lawyers money could buy\nCertainly Roscoe ... fit this description\nFor nearly two decades constantly had been a leader of the Republican Party in Congress heating had even been nominated and confirmed to the United States Supreme court himself turning the seat down after winning confirmation he remains by the way the last person to this day to turn down a Supreme Court seat after having won confirmation\nHe frankly admitted that the reason was financial he was simply making too much money as a lawyer for the railroads [noise]\nNow the southern Pacific railroad lawyers like constantly first settled on a strategy of civil disobedience they would simply refused to pay the tax\nAnd then a half century before the N. double ACP is famous litigation campaign against racial segregation in schools the southern Pacific railroad launched a groundbreaking series of what its lawyers called quote test cases more than sixteen all seeking a Supreme Court ruling recognizing expanse of rights for corporations\nThe railroads litigation campaign like that of the N. double ACP decades later was focused on the fourteenth amendment to the constitution which says that no state showed the night to any person the equal protection of the law\nThis provision was added to the constitution right after the civil war to guarantee the rights of the newly freed slaves yet conquering argue that it was also written to protect business costs\nBut there's one thing you should know about Roscoe ... was that he was not the type of war who would allow a little thing like the text of the constitution to get in his way\nAnd constantly told the justices that earlier drafts of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause had guaranteed writes originally to quote citizen but that the language was changed specifically to the word persons to he said quote embrace artificial persons as well as natural person\nNow this was a pretty audacious argument for Koch linked to make but he was uniquely situated to make it when ... was a young congressman after the civil war he had served on the very committee that hadn't written the fourteenth amendment\nAnd in fact body Eighteen eighties when he argued before the Supreme Court he was the last surviving member of the committee that wrote the fourteenth amendment so there was no one there to refute his ... his tail\nHe even produced a musty all journal that he claimed was a never before published record of the deliberations of the drafting committee of the fourteenth amendment and he said a close look at that journal will support his story\nNow there was one small problem with ... account of the history of the fourteenth amendment\nWhich was that it wasn't true [noise] we now know that the language of the amendment had never been changed from citizen to person the way ... inclined nor the records show that any member of the drafting committee ever said or implied that corporations would be protected to win the amendment was proposed and ratified by the states\nAs one historian who examined the evidence closely concluded the trust of coddling had engaged in quote a deliberate brazen forgery to wind who writes for corporations\nNow the Supreme Court never ruled in ... case surprisingly enough holding onto it for three years without ever issuing a decision now some people think that it was a procedural snafu that stopped the court from rolling but I suspect that from the ... fraud was\nLater this time without ... or any mention of his journal\nAnd then the second case the court ruled in favor of the southern Pacific railroad although specifically avoiding the constitutional question the court said we're not ruling on whether corporations have equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment but then the southern Pacific railroads case took a bizarre turn\nThe courts opinions are published an official volumes which are edited by someone known as the reporter of decisions\nAnd traditionally the reporter of decisions writes up a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion and publishers it right in the front of the opinion in the official volumes and this was makes were legal research easier a lawyer can pull it off read the summary figure out what the court has held before he goes into the dogs into the larger opinion\nThe Supreme Court reporter of decisions back in the Eighteen eighties I wasn't manning Jaycee Bancroft Davis\nNow and ... and Davis a summary of the southern Pacific case said that the court had ruled quote the defendant corporations are persons within the intent of the clause and the fourteenth amendment which forbids a state to deny to any person the equal protection of laws\nNow we don't know what motivated Bancroft Davis to include such an inaccurate summary when the court specifically said it was not ruling on that issue but if you're one for conspiracy theories you might be interested to know that Jacey bankrupt Davis had once served as president of the new Bergen New York railway company\nJustice Stephen field or what I saw the opportunity presented by Davis is inaccurate summary\nIf you're not familiar with Justice Stephen field is one of the most powerful men ever to sit on the United States Supreme court he was the first justice from the wild west and he was refuted to carry a gun underneath his roads at all times he's also the only sitting justice who was ever arrested for a crime\nAnd the crime was murder\nNow of course he was innocent but perhaps we could say\nWhen the southern Pacific case was handed down field grows his own opinion arguing that the court had the ... uh suffered a dereliction of duty by failing to reach the important fourteenth amendment question about whether corporations had writes\nNonetheless field and the majority opinion a few years later on a related issue drops a sentence well as we held in the southern Pacific railroad case corporations are persons entitled to equal protection of laws on the fourteenth amendment\nSomething that field and due to be untrue and it even written opinion arguing that we had not decided that\nYet in the years to follow the southern Pacific case would be sided over and over again for the proposition that corporations are entitled to fourteenth amendment rights\nNo one reason field was able to get away with his sleight of hand if you will was that he never left captured the spirit of a Supreme Court was entering into an era in its history known as the lock in\nThe locker us a well known a historical era and the Supreme Court's history from roughly Eighteen Ninety to Nineteen thirty seven and during this period the court became known for being very business friendly and the court broadly interpreted the constitution to strike down numerous regulations of business\nUh including striking down federal child labor laws zoning laws minimum wage laws\n[noise] meanwhile in cases like plus a against Ferguson upholding separate but equal the same Supreme Court refused to read the fourteenth amendment broadly to provide any meaningful protection for African Americans the intended beneficiaries of the amendment\nIndeed between Eighteen sixty eight when the fourteenth amendment was ratified and Nineteen twelve the court decided a total of twenty eight fourteenth amendment cases on the rights of African Americans most of them against African Americans\nAt the same time during that same period the court decided and astonishing three hundred and twelve cases on the fourteenth amendment rights of business corporations now\nCorporations in the Nineteen oh five case the Supreme Court said the corporations had property rights but not liberty rights [noise]\nCorporations needed basic protections for their assets for their buildings for their property but the court refused to extend the corporations rights that were associated with personal conscience um individual liberty and political freedom\nIn a case of opposite of of this terms high profile controversy involving a bakery that refused to sell the wedding cake to a same sex couple the Supreme Court in Nineteen oh seven held that a corporation did not have a constitutional right to refuse service to unwanted customers\nThe corporation that ... racetrack in California later home to the legendary Seabiscuit challenge to California law that required places of public amusement to admit anyone with a valid tickets\nThe company claimed that this law on early anti discrimination law violated its right to freedom of association\nNow over the years the Supreme Court has occasionally treated the corporation has its own independent legal person separate and apart from its members the surprising thing is that in these cases the court has tended to limit and restrict the rights of business corporations\nAnd an Eighteen thirty nine case the Supreme Court refused to extend the corporations the privileges or and immunities of article for the constitution the privileges or immunities clause article for means\nThat if you move from Ohio to California you're entitled to all the same legal rights as a California\nCorporation seeking to operate in the increasingly national marketplace of the early Eighteen hundreds tried to use this provision to challenge state laws that restrict it out of state corporations from coming in and doing business there\nAnd the corporations argued that since their members were citizens are and they can go into any state and we're entitled to do business on the same terms as locals well\nThen the corporations should have that same freedom to the Supreme Court led by Roger Tony ruled against the corporations although reviled today for his opinion and the notorious Dred Scott case Tony had one thing that today's opponents of Citizens United might appreciate\nShould quote is a person for certain purposes when a corporation makes a contract the contract of that legal after the of the artificial being created by the charter and not the contract on the individual numbers in ... view the rights and duties of the corporate entity were separate and distinct from the rights and duties of the corporations number\nThe Supreme Court did something similar in the early Nineteen hundreds in a case arising out of Teddy Roosevelt famous effort to break up the troughs\nRoosevelt launched a criminal investigation of the tobacco trust and subpoena the company's officers to testify or an before the grand jury the companies claim that this was a violation of their right against self and criminalization to require their own officers to come testify against the corporations\nBut the Supreme Court said it was not self incriminating because the company and its members were separate legal persons with separate legal rights and separate legal duties\nGood afternoon and you've been listening to the city club of Cleveland friday

Eighteen into combat and she's really seen as a Democrats hope to kind of flip one Republican control district in the country in their favor\nYou know she prided herself on really tried to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district um but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts\nThe most evident last week she brought for vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in ... ville it's a town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nNow the thing about any McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars at about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and is a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere's certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know a nascent nationwide interest in this race\nI mean it's at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more TV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November sick\nAnd what do the poll say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there is no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge and and really if it's something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nSo Kentucky ... six congressional district will be one of those key places people are watching to see it\nReporter for Kentucky public radio thank you thanks Peter the TV show the counters premiered this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr\nABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was a hit it was cancelled though after it's dark tweeted racist remarks now the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher\nHigh so the first episode is a send off to the character Roseanne Connor we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grim and morbid what do you think\n[noise] I think she's right but I also think the storytelling worked so [laughter]\nUm they had for shadow that I'm Roseanne Connor the character would be struggling with a an addiction and pain pills and so if they're going to kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and it also hooks it into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talking about because of the way that there was any kind of character passed without\nAll important issues the question is who saw the show a and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors we're down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on ...\nI mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting and then you also had news that the rose encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter and I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show\nI think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of its run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so I don't think the Connors is going to get to that level but it's drawing about the same audience that rose in the revival was doing when it ended its run in may\nAnd then it's going to be their challenge to kind of building the audience\nAnd retain people who may have just watched the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to Roseanne character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the ... than they did and Roseanne\nI seem to episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show that tried to talk about all of the different issues that face the working class family and it wasn't quite as part is that I mean\nI I have to say I I I watched that show a lot out when I was growing up and I never thought of it as a political show at all\nYeah I mean I think it actually was a political show it just wasn't about a particular political party so now the shows kind of back to what it was doing before which was trying to explore these issues with an idea tour as you know breaking down some of the stereotypes that people might have about working class families and talking honestly about the issues they face\nAnd they're also talking a bit about gay rights because one of the characters\nCame out during the episode and I think we have a clip of that let's check it out\nFor you know oh I was kind of waiting for you to tell me about it takes a long [noise]\nArcade or why did it happen again\nThe feminine way in the revival and they had an episode that kind of dealt with that but I think they were sort of insistent that he wasn't necessarily gay now they have this character saying that he is gay and that continues among a tradition that Roseanne original series had of exploring these kinds of issues in an honest way", "show_name": "The City
