{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "And so that was part of the hangover of the second book which leads us to this one I wanted to understand how we came to live in a country\nThat at one level or as Dan indicated has all these indicators of rich people being very very worried for those left behind the giving pledge\nUm four hundred and ten billion dollars given away philanthropic Lee in this country last year the year before approaching the level of federal non military discretionary spending we always have this other fourth branch of government that just rich people writing checks and putting their names on things um\nPrize idea involving recycled poop coffee tote bag in Rwanda\nAnd everybody wants to save her one day even though they're going to need them\nUm\nYou have products everywhere certified by bono and determined to help for people so you have all this elite helpful is and yet the reality which we know in Ohio very well is it this has been a punishing few decades if you happened to be a regular person\nOr the worst time to be a working class middle class American hundred years um the reality that basically forty years of economic growth\nHas bypassed the bottom half of this country on average the idea that social mobility which is maybe the national creative this country the idea that if we all believe ones have you on the right and left believe one thing that this is an ought to be a country where where you end up as a product of\nHow hard you work what you do that's probably something you can get Ninety percent of Americans who say yes that's us too which they're not many things like that well it turns out to be the least true unfortunately the thing that you could get the most people to agree is us is the least true of us\nIn the rich world and the thing that we think is our thing is actually the thing we are the least thingy at 'em and\nAnd so I started to become interested in how it is that all these elites whether it's caught in the college kids all the way up to the billionaire helping sits alongside the reality of that broken system\nThe broken progress machine I define a successful society as a progress machine you can envision a machine in the center of this room and into one side of the machine the input is innovation is new stuff mhm innovation doesn't have a bias to do X Y\nBut let's Russians conquer our electoral space it could be anything that's what the machines for the machine decides what'd you get on the other side and what you're supposed to get on on the other side of progress is which is most people's lives getting better our institutions getting better that machine in the center of the room is what's broken\nWe have innovation does anybody think there hasn't been enough new stuff in America over the last forty years by the way there are many countries I think Spain\nHas not had another innovation of it last forty years I think France has not had enough innovation over the last forty years there are countries countries with a different problem than we have which is generalized decline I don't think you can say that's our situation\n... how many of the top hundred universities do we have Ninety\nHow many of the biggest companies do we have\nNinety percent like so our problem is we're jamming all this new stuff and good stuff into the machine and betterment of every ... every person in this country is life does not happen um and so I decided to go on a reporting journey 'cause I'm a reporter um my opinions come at the end of reporting\nAt least my public ones and I decided to go on a reporting journey among these very rich and powerful people who are trying to help\nTo see what they were up to and to try to understand how they continue to give in ways that don't just fail to change the dynamics that I'm describing but actually\nPerhaps shore up the very broken system mhm the benefits them and shuts everybody else out awesome well thank you for sharing\nAt the root of how this came to be and um [noise] you you touched on a number of things that I kind of want to tease out a little bit more in the time that we have so through your reporting journey um you engage with a number of folks Facebook assign I think was mention mover\nWe're trying to find their way in the world and you know what were they going to do 'em and you were bold enough to not only name those enterprises are those businesses but also talk about kind of this mindset that was being developed around the business per approach is really what\nUm is that the core of solutions to society today um\nMy takeaway is that there's a real skepticism around that there is a real danger around that and see your point we've kind of\nProduced this force um strand of of government that really is just very wealthy people writing checks so go a little deeper around the skepticism are we really out sourcing social change to the wealthy um and what might be the cautionary tale and\nAt ... at the heart of this book you the most skeptical question you could ask about me and my idea is is what could be wrong with rich people turn out yeah they're not solving everything yeah there's big issues but like what's wrong with at least trying to do something mhm\nAnd my book is not saying at least try to do something is should be banned but my book is trying to make a case\nThat at least trying to do something is often in addition to that and doing something feeding that person putting a roof over that person's head sheltering someone it is also abetting a problem\nOn a much faster scale and so let me explain how I think that works with a couple things first of all\nAnd the most easy case that we don't understand is a lot of the folks who cause our social problems\nShow up wearing philanthropic hats as the cleanup crew mhm for the problems that we still remember that caused okay so you all remember the foreclosure crisis in the city you know it very well we know the banks\nOh a sign of Thirteen billion ... a city paid a Goldman Sachs five billion dollars ... we we know the names we know where they are we know the address is we know who who did you all know people who maybe never recovered from that ... years to recover from that right\nSo we know who did it not all of those banks\nAre back doing some philanthropies\nDoing some cs R. J. P. Morgan Chase so kind just announced [laughter] five hundred million unfortunately million with an M which is not\nThe level of destruction that cause which is with a B and a five hundred million dollar urban revitalization sun makes me almost cry but not um [noise]\nAnd I'm sure the Cleveland is one of the cities is going to be eligible for this kind of large yes but you know what would have been so much better for revitalizing\nCleveland other cities like it not killing it [laughter] not causing a financial crisis paying a sixteen million dollar fine 'cause you committed fraud\nAnd then doling out these little chip so still the easiest case where you say doing a little good what was that kind of do ... and ... those are ... modern people indulgences\nYou send your profit from your sin you hurt people and you sprinkle a little bit of uh things that kind of change your reputation in the reality is world board where we were all busy and board and busy with our aging parents I'm busy with our children and we don't have time to have\nEighty eight facts in our head about J. P. Morgan Chase is we have time for like one or two facts about every\nInstitution unless it's like what you do for a living and so that's the way it works\nBecause in our minds it's like yeah Jeffrey Morgan Chase urban revitalization company that's how that works um more complicated example\nIs you have\nAnd then present themselves as deliverance windows public policy is great social problems David Reuben Stein wonderful example co founder of the Carlisle group you may know him as a\nCause you're busy people a patriotic philanthropist how many have you heard that term patriotic philanthropy here's what that means he buys documents he's like the sugar daddy to the United states government [laughter] he buys documents the U.S government evidently can't afford for itself we've\nYou know we we can afford that like spend all these years in Iraq I think we're still there um but we can't afford the magna Carter so he buys a magnet Carter at an auction and then we'll give it to America Obama wanted some\nSome art in his documents in his uh Oval Office he I think he bought it\nGave a job on the um the Washington Monument cracks in an earthquake in two thousand eleven right down the middle which is the greatest metaphor that Mother Nature has ever done on the United states [laughter]\nSo one of the things I think these are the hard cases to think about\nWhat I talk to people about it if you are one of those ... if you work in public service or in the civic sphere\nFight like hell to create the conditions for that to be solved publicly file lawsuits organize et cetera et cetera but if you are in philanthropy\nThere are ways to give on an issue like that that keeps everything as it is and just help some people and it sounds to me like this giving a sort of in that vein there are other ways to give that that does put a band aid on the issue that addresses that the immediate bleeding but\nAlso simultaneously pushes for deeper more systemic change and if you were privileged person\nI think it's important to not just support the five hundred dollar grants but to somehow tied that if you receive a grant you go to meetings\nAnd those meetings you actually organizing you meet the right there's a way to use that kind of giving to actually solve the underlying systemic issue for example turn everybody who received\nAnd I said a rich people if you if you're going to give there are ways to give that are essentially self preservation and preservation all of the system that you stand on top of the people out and there are other ways of giving that actually put yourself at risk that I think of the right way to give and\nYou've been listening to live speech from the city club or forty one by former New York times foreign correspondent and author ... do you hear the expanded broadcast tune in tonight a tenant W.

B. U. R. I'm Peter O'Dowd and I'm ... now authorities have taken one person into custody today in connection with the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump twelve packages had been discovered so far the latest address to senator Cory Booker and to the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's Quil Lawrence has been following this story Quil what do we know about the man who was arrested earlier today\nBut his name is ... or say arc or fifty six years old he's from uh Ventura Florida just north of Miami\nA possibly born in New York but has lived in Florida for several years he's a registered Republican he has a criminal history in Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One including a theft and fraud charges um and Joe what's perhaps the most telling about him is\nA political manifesto written on the side of his white van in stickers ah where he uh has a lot of references to vice president Pence and of course President Trump\nOr and also against George Soros I'm so I'm looking at his social media you can see that he's a very much involved in politics he tweeting about uh the governor's race against the Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum down their\nPolice were said to have known about this man is he say he had a criminal past you know what it is that led to stories directly to him\nThere had been uh some focus on Florida as where these packages had been mailed from a very quickly\nAnd are experts have been talking about the amount of evidence that might have been left behind because these packages included tape and plastic bubble wrap that there could be fingerprints as well as possibly DNA I'm so authorities were were moving very quickly on this and we're focusing on Florida\nAnd we can assume that they tracked from the the uh possibly from surveillance cameras at at the post office where they found that some of these packages might have been sent from but it's early days\nWe'll do you have any idea of just how he was arrested or was he wins the vehicle that um that they took away at the time was he considered dangerous when they arrested him\nUm we know he was arrested at about eleven o'clock this morning in a parking lot of shopping center implantation Florida which is just outside of Fort Lauderdale\nUm you know there was some street shutdown around there uh and there was this white van which was towed away covering stickers ah people on social media have been tweeting\nPictures of the white van because it was such a a a noticeable vehicle or people who'd seen it in traffic and and taking pictures of it to send to their friends are now putting them up on social media so you can kind of a read into his character from what he displayed on his van\nTrump or got word earlier today right after the arrest apparently in ...\nWe've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and

practically vanished the small spit of sand known as Easter Island was critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals\nToday it is mostly underwater hurricane lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now and and chip you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a block I knew it had headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a\nHead into French ... and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunning\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures that here now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists\nA undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up\nMade of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um digs their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd there are only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being this Easter Island which was the largest one uh that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turned in the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low lying it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those ice\nUm it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's still a very strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes to that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actual is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are that are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice islands\nUh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average when speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour and um\nYou know that's just an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category sets last year hurricane season and twenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking or with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that he's down to come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by the hurricane to the north and north east the\nTrade when waves may push that sand back\nA word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling sea level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions\nSpeaking with us You're like you and other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent and the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAdjacent Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he\nSays if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in rent and sorts of St ability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shift about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much we do we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do a nice pair of comparison right we are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talk about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certain\nShe gets ... F trained in these like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet right like as opposed to like\nHow have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible to have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so it's not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you did not step is that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle to give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nIs going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying it but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nThat you can think of to sort of a tendencies one is the sort of rise of the other sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation another would be very local organizations but with a sort of very grand division or this is the group's cooperation Jackson, Mississippi\nWho are really trying to build a sort of ego um sustainable society from the ground up meaning what\nOh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic governments they are trying to and they are succeeding in some ways a to build\nA sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing um but that doesn't ignore these political and economic parts of the story right that are trying to put really a democratic control as necessary medium through which this management", "show_name": "The City Club Forum", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "26"}
