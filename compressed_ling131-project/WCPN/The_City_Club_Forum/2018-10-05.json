hackers did not access any third party apps but it's still investigating the scope of the hack\nSo let's dig into this and quality assurance the friday segment where we take a deeper look at a big tech story Mike Isaac as a reporter for the New York times he said you may not really understand how far Facebook's Web really goes\nI think for like ten years now Mark Zuckerberg has been sort of position and Facebook as a identity layer or a passport to the rest of the Internet and they've literally been sort of pitching ads\nFacebook buttons to your website ad Facebook log in so it makes it much simpler for people to just get up and use your apps like immediately but with that\nSort of convenience tradeoff comes or real security issue which is like when you have all that information and all that stuff's I'm In one place hackers are going to go after that one centralized place about much more and really scrutinize Facebook security all over the platform\nYeah security experts have been warning about this exact thing for a long time this kind of universal logging on the plus side is it surprising that it took Facebook this long to have a ... big\nYeah totally I mean I think credit where do Facebook as well as Google and you know some other tech companies out here probably have some of the best people in the entire world working on these systems and to be fair there are always going to be minor bugs and exploits that folks attack\nBut I think if there was one attack that was going to happen this is probably the worst possible version of it for Facebook\nYeah Ken Facebook at this point be trusted you know mark was awkward sat there in front of Congress\nIs there ever going to be a moment where people go oh okay you're right I Believe you we should not too big

their users with their data so uh I Am not convinced that they still deserve to serve their users especially after\nThe past two years of really damaging news from them but it's still one of those convenience trade offs and I also don't think millions of people are going to just stop using them at least overnight so what kind of going to have to wait and see if people actually log back in or not\nLike I think as a reporter at the New York times since news of the half broke Irish privacy regulators who are in charge of enforcing Europe's sweeping data regulations have launched an official

soon as tomorrow today's procedural vote was fifty one to forty nine\nEight key swing Senator Jeff flake says he will vote yes tomorrow unless something big changes\nAnd Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today saying Brett Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time\nJoining us now is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Hi Nina high so where do we stand right now with the remaining swing senators Joe Manchin the Democrat and Susan Collins Republican\nWell Susan Collins says she's going to announce her intentions on the final vote that she'll do that in his speech on the floor later\nAnd we don't know how he's going to vote and we don't know whether he's conferring with a senator ... or and endorsed Senator Flake who is also voted for the Republican who also had voted to advance\nThe nomination but still could vote against it although I think the odds of that are very very slim [noise] um I think this is you know this is still a bit up in the air but yet to be determined\nAnd does the edge go to Kevin gets confirmed or Kevin doesn't get confirmed at this point do you think\nThe edge goes to Kavanaugh gets confirmed because usually when you vote to end debate or that means you're going to\nVote for the nominee but not always um as as a demonic online to narrow pointed out just a couple of hours ago Susan Collins did this on the bed the device nomination she was on the committee overseeing that nomination she voted to advance it to the floor\nAnd to ... to ... to ... go to a vote on the floor and then she voted against the nomination\nListen to some of what we've heard today this is Chuck Grassley the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee speaking this morning on the Senate for before that vote\nOn pleases or judge Kavanaugh's confirmation I'm Sorry for\nThe whole family went through the last several weeks we should all admire Kevin all his willingness to service conquer despite\nThe way he's been treated

the older but still fast talking broadcast journalist to returns alongside the original cast\nNPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it ... hey so Murphy Brown was always about mining politics for entertainment back in the day had had fans from both sides of the aisle Senator Orrin hatch\nRepublican of Utah even sending the head shot hoping to make a guest appearances do you think you could have crossover appeal today or are they even making an effort now\nIn one word or you know I spoke to the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July\nAnd basically she told me she didn't think there would be a show 'em there would be a revival uh if if Trump hadn't been elected president\nUm she was a how supportive of Hillary Clinton ran a pack um that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah\nAh for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she could no open when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect the Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this show that features these people were supposed to be top journalists\nAnd because she's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state or to actually make an appearance on the show so we've got a clip of that or let's let's let's say\nAnd I also assume you've had previous secretarial exterior absolutely for four years I was the secretary [noise] I was a secretary at a very large aren't going to [noise] and you have all the requisite skills computer male female [noise]\nI I Do have some experience with [noise]\nAlways makes you wonder if she's running or something again I get out [laughter] no I doubt it I don't think they would have brought up emails editor right\nUm it ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was a she is also appeared in a an episode of Madam Secretary that trauma um alongside Colin Powell and I'm I'm uh in in uh other political so I'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump ism the Murphy Brown revival\nAnd I'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back against some of the things they do so this shows very much about pushing back against Trump ism and pushing back against the monitor shape but the GOP so it it is not a bipartisan\nNow the original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life meets fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential election Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown\nFor having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to quilt criticisms in the show and now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump\nThere there's a a there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional uh news characters on the air and tweeting about them\nOh you were wearing a hat on [noise]\n\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivered a very if the effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show\nI think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival I I didn't I found some of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned and in some of the speech fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a diabetic\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish the show 'em ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweet at them\nA while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but um what's really happening is that there are so many people that have been saying things like this for so long on TV including most of the late night comedians that we have Steven ... Jimmy Kimmel on\nA tour Noah that uh it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nUh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think his left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times\nWell what about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bring back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean a in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh because the drill school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was\nIn Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh went centered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents he vowed to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge him soul searching who's making a mistake\nSchools have already changed dramatically since the eighties Paul free says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent and respect\nIt is changing but it's still a problem on campuses and I certainly can't say that we are out of the woods yet\nThen did just three years ago saying all been school in D.C had to recall it yearbooks after discovering seniors at the elite all boys school had included crude and success slurs\nThat's way too recent this is very disturbing\nAttorney Eric leash represents victims of sexual assault in is also a scene all been alone\nThat tells me that there's an issue with that school is really indefensible saying all the ins declined to comment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The City Club Forum", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "05"}
