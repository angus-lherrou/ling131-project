years and back when he was working here at today's show is a rerun he made a decision to return to his childhood he went searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate and their parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan me and her three in the back room and telling about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on

got home from work [noise] we didn't know any adults like her he loved her [noise] December before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\n[noise]\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen the cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up in their shoes in Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I check them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has to be some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood deck she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nAnd tell her to hold on I'm trying to get my break we can catch up\nShe says great and steps aside [noise]\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nFinally test me on the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at two or three for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\n\n\nThat drives me crazy but I never saw her again if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play with to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten them\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things\nAbout me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nI'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do I Do you remember she was in Jordan Wright\nIs George\nGeorge yes it's bringing up out but I Can't place a she was our babysitter\nOh OK chicken like in my past\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter really add more of a relationship with you too and she did with us she seems to have a very meaningful relationship with you\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons\nPosted to us I think that we we responded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it\n[laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean they're people are complicated now what I really\nWanted to do would spend more time with your mom and dad but I was\nTerrified [noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy and though a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out [laughter] and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\nMm\nEverytime subjective are hard times come up on your subtle hesitancy into towards\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly it wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized when it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and\nThat's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby sitter the kids love me\nBlah blah blah [laughter] but\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\nSusan Jordan the upper left that I remember\nIs he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out that also done my best to forget what I was like\nI didn't think of myself as where it all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine I was anxious and bookish\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got to strike but it just seems like there were mostly folks and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that cake\nHardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had they not just in more serious in general so mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nYou know Mm\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we needed to about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her talk mess in the face of hardship she said she mostly remembered the side of my family but I just took for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that

which lasted for\nAnd then the [noise]\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise] that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel and\n[laughter] I mean [laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the deep thoughts of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to lead his nation [noise]\nThat you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\nGreatly me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and watch out will generate here comes out of them was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] wow [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] no that's a that's kind of amazing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel sure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that here I understand your prime minister of

exactly [noise]\nGetting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would predict would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this\nRidiculous fantasy of you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but\nI don't know I mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ... ...\n[noise] I Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel [noise]\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect millions of people\nLike how is that enough motivation you know just to have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed to [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah he would be very very disgusted\nTo see her this this radio to ease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory origin I came to us from a graduate student Hillary frankly standing trying it the New York Academy of art and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine and then\nTo edit the quotes that she had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nOne reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make a bully sound like story on our show\nIt's a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top half\n[noise] it was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\nUm [noise]\nThought aboard one night and we decided to go up to the crowd and [noise] I guess basically got I'm On a on the phone back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was and how magnificent he was [noise] and I'm\nActually right after that I might have gotten and forth back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter] and uh I guess that really struck a chord of effort that was\nPretty amazing\nI'm going to\nGive out a lot about it um [noise] it actually good a scene of me thinking along [laughter] I'll pick your path\n\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall\nThe next day on the weight of class\nHe saw signs all over him is that in both pretty\nI Am nine feet tall and see giant and then eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who puts him that\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nNeed a character in costumes for the giant\nGiant man a booming boy\nPardon me even though exactly it was something like you know I'm old I Am drawing you know just the you know loud but just kind of weird [noise]\nYou know sort of suggesting that way you know I don't know\n[noise]\nGot asked his college friends total access giant men's legs\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln wrapped around their middle high Toto\nAnd black really way like the guy I think\nWe picked up a point in the bushes pulled out on that I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out on the quad until the time came and I got on the shoulder effects way up to the bike around my waist and we walked out\nAnd I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people Fifteen people right and I
