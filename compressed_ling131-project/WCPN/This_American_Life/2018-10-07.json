in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing that was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively\nReading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nFrom to me this one feels the worst [noise] I think because the original hearing itself abducted forward and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was a motion was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting\nFor the FBI report which held us off or a week in that same state education and disbelief Republican disbelief that the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside and incredibly\nSometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nAnd I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on a man's life or death\nThey are not comfortable with hall [noise] let me be the Chicago just American Life America stay with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nJudge to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turned the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over there was undecided than seem like a no and Kevin up there was a yes it was let's wait a week there's if we can be the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British is do we choose to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill is with them in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't as clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nAnd just admit for an interview [noise]\nJust like these can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nDashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was stuck\nThen he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation\nWords have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\nArchie and I was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to where Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't and I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAnd on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved his version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks\nHas been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and this morning that they have any mind also we talked about it\nWasn't as it was a\nIt was a thing just not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women\nWe support what do you believe in one way and therefore we believe women were you when you think you can replace what do you have to say something you can say that went in right now and the survivors\nGlad we're having this hearing today\nDoes it affect you and people yelling like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe week making fun of himself we've talked about this before like lots of men his age doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going to a deal like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just does ensure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators\nTrying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt as certain to go out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nYou watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here the night after the four cabinet tests\nSalts he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything in a decision on a vote 'em it's been it's just it's a debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw [noise]\nNext morning of course like finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the ... to come back to\nTo do for some sort of innocence and\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and he gets the news that flake the yes she chokes up reportedly says\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason I'm struggling sorry a lot of tears in the capital\nThose two days the meeting begins the two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably checks Twitter because he usually does but\nHe says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR bit says he wasn't thinking about that at all so he comes back and then Coons gives a speech at\nThe committee meeting that he said was directed at one man Jeff Flake they're actually friends during the Foreign Relations committee together\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\nHe told me over and over he was satisfied with the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you you're kind of back among among your people\nDrive people [laughter] that's a chocolate chip are only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no idle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\nEver [noise]\n\nChase ... program which turned out it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years does him being questioned into cue an egg back in twenty ten\nI stand here today a justice of potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through\nWell I like my own ... uh [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is a political party and they have to act in the political way\nThe famous new there\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe neutrality and the independents\n[noise]\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament commitment and uh the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you have to be careful about the [noise]\nSome ... southern southern southern southern Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people ask them by the state cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court you know by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works\nWe will meet um just the nine of us and uh\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nAnd if the case is one in which there is a great issues of public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision\nOr the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that your gift\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nIn the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realize one of us will have to write an opinion that come in\nTo teach the principles of law the principles of the constitution that controls the result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on that capital of\nTrust we make a withdrawal on the trust in the public has in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nOkay well my story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well\nI'm I have four clerks and divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nAnd they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the briefs the second time over the weekend just before arguments and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nWe're too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty are here some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I'd lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand is all I have a rule like that when I write those breaks I said oh it is it are the ones that fact raping a six pack\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack\nWho's done where like beer [noise]\nThanks to perform club with the Palm Beach is that recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete amateur has to decide to death sentence previous experience in these

and indignation and like and crossed wires that next time on them off radio hour from Seattle [noise]\nBut that's coming up at the top of the hour a Ninety point three [noise]\nJust American Life from Eric last today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that one of our program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with that want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays a kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is a more serious one\nAnyway here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on oil but don't give jury duty but I was more curious and interested in like the the process and you know I like to watch and stuff like law and order and other things like that\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know\nI could have changed\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spanned never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn\nGot in touch she reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should forget the name\nThat forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nOr he did begin reply but I didn't\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers\nAnd it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like a really read things uh [noise]\n\nA few months after span receive Maryland's email and execution date was set the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened\nGlen and you'd have to carry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want to pile stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached\nIt's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise] for not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not trying\nShame leads to a nurse or\nAs even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would reads and I hope I'm not being too forward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forwards originally email just fan the once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about\nWhen I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son\nOr tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\n... I I was joking I\nOf I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah okay\n... lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in a hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can stop refusing\nView one of the coffee or tea\nMaryland is a child and stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to it in the armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always the life of the party I mean I was a jokester all makes you you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know calm relish should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the mobile and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our powders to cause the bottom of this and that was a very hurtful it's like they wanted everything to be okay\nBut that's my chow\nAnd I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nI'll be getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a hard thing\nI'm I'm [noise] I'm\nTen years after the trial and every one of her friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland reds fans articles and she saw him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay descendants the death penalty\nI had that I thought I had literally died they didn't even register because I'm just like you know what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing [noise]\nUm I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he has and I want people to know you know everybody's ... they assumed that if you involved in a heinous crime I ... through a monster but he wasn't a monster\n\nIf there is no okay so she is going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for us\nI think that probably has his name's then is it the ... as the and spends and spends\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spend is at the door [noise]\nSpent a Jonathan ...
