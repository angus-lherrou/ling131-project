[noise] door opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything but just timing the response and it wasn't great\nThat wasn't attorneys appeared at the first yeah oh yeah it was it was on the doors\nWe said so controversial to put guns into school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nWell I I talked to John the principal about this you know I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one they came to the school and the school's pretty ...\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise] because they're fine mess [noise] there's a possibility somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts a student at my school\nOf course she might have to shoot one at a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening [noise] they just continue to happen\n\nThese shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out\nSchool administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll just passed to just be the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if a shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nAt one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can and it's still not enough to where people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help him WB easy Chicago it's this American Life America ...\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there is an example out there that might be really helpful\nAnd that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting\nIn a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than the worst day and I mean they knew what I mean [noise]\nEven sell even when we still had\nCasualties have the people that are going to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it was actually an open question when our producers Robin semi and went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well they did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane\nThe students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner\nShe believes in a good hard think and being proactive once she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every ... every this is what a ... this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared it's like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors the paper and leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active\nShooter to see and that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight before Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do\nActually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing her cool what she did actually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them\nThat are running towards the freshman building um\nI'm run keep running away from the sound\nHow is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad\nIt sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how much you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied cause someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight\nAnd she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group tax between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Ferris says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in ...\nWay um we got really quiet um has it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like illuminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not because you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a please send you one in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grazed she survived\nHe's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in his doorway that\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both\nTold me that having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnston didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meanings\nConsumes I talked to said no to this too I'm a big advocate for not using codes at all\nVersus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yet\nBut the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision\nI told her about actually occurs how sheets the doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student from a rose up right\nFrom her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet\nI wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with that\nAnd unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened\nNow does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nOn this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional locked down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the drill is four she said I don't know exactly and say\nDid a traditional lockdown squatting behind because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all they'd have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWe don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all [noise]\nBut my daughter to know everything [noise]\nAllowed her to know about barricaded [noise]\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because it's a thing to reckon with [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about don't say codes\nCall it like it is\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom into my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I there's a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n... ... ... ...\nThis year at Douglas there are new Gates's new fences new cameras Jim back\nSearches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits in every room Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one ... and they already did a code red trail only this time there was no confusion about one it would be school called parents\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and start selling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know is is the violence is going on in this world goes away it's not going to change that because the strip or yours drug stores are still able to do\nYou plan to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year develop those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks in tight regulation\nPush their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed and Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control and then he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shoving match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to Jones through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... or ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get\nThe FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is Warren parents about they tell families to brace themselves\n\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughter shooting they got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us\nThis was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark\nCalled Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just\n[noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I was like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took to never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died [noise]\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into\nHe said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the Philips has said there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents some other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson these parents have lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nThe filters now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moments that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money in Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nWant you to move on what they want you to get back to normal Mike Moen rather should they should you know Seamus you were shouldn't you know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nOn ship start to fall away\nPeople you were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son and a shooting in Parkland\nOn I couldn't that store at I met them at their house their son's name was Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nMitt said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nThe day of the shooting Mitch an article about phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer was giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who mash next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area they sat in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rings you jumped and think his name calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comments can we have to find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the ears screams from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... we couldn't even find your son you know and that whole thought that he was arrested and have to keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like\nNever brought to the hospital to second nightmare second\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at it injuries Mitch did not\nOn August says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas cage to swim or this summer's perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like his he was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his chops destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him\nYes he left for because your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an era Fifteen just\nSo gross I'm so horrible horrible\nAnd I think to see him and to see on his body whereas injuries were were um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Cleveland", "day":
