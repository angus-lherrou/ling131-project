every Sunday evening a during the German American radio show in Iraq and comment about uh\nUh Germany is or Berlin may be toying with the idea of embracing its nuclear ambitions but doing so would jeopardize the delicate balance of power in Europe an article by what can you sing I'm\nI'm a and who is a former German ambassador to the United states and he has these comments as a a reported in the German newspaper the New Yorkers thought side too many rights\nAs in any game of chess or there are geopolitical moves in which a country can on within the chicken made itself opening a debate on German nuclear weapons would be such a move yet this is exactly what some Germans\nHave recent the proposed supporters of the nuclear armed Germany\nContend that NATO in nuclear and read them has lost all credibility because of statements made by president Donald Trump\nThere are at least\nOr at least three good reasons why considering a nuclear option would be foolhardy for Germany or for starters ...\nThree D. on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons\nAnd then in Nineteen Ninety by saying this so called two plus for three D. which are paved the way for Germany's a reunification of a part of the Germany of what was former East Germany which is the central Germany\nThe actual East Germany is still under polish administration casting doubt on the commitments of what the severely damaged Germany's reputation and reliability worldwide\nGermany would call into question the credibility of NATO's nuclear deterrence and dusty alliance itself\nAlong with the entire nuclear nonproliferation regime [noise]\nIt's worth noting that since its creation in Nineteen forty nine NATO has been one of the world's most successful institutions of proliferation prevention\nNot a single NATO member state apart from the United states the United kingdom in France\nHas found it necessary to acquire nuclear weapons I'm I'm of its own knife Germany or now to break out of it's a non nuclear power status what would keep turkey or Poland or for instance uh\nFrom following suit to Germany as a grave digger of the international nonproliferation regime who would want that second day German nuclear bomb would damage the strategic environment in Europe to Germany's a disadvantage Russia would\nInterpret the Germans steps toward a nuclear arsenal as a direct threat to its own national security and would likely adopt military counter measures that in turn would make it even harder to pursue the vision of a pan European order of peace and security a chorus\nI mean a German nuclear ambition might be jeopardized might also jeopardize the delicate balance of power in Europe including between Germany and France and this axis has worked supposedly innocence a day of formed a German French or a ... a\nFor a with the incalculable consequences for the long term cohesion of the European Union\nFinding it is not hard to predict that the pursuit of nuclear weapons would draw significant public opposition especially given that such a move would be a complete above face for German chance that got on get medical government was just a few years ago\nMoved to phase out nuclear energy\nA altogether it is difficult to imagine a greater fiasco for German foreign and security policy then proposing a nuclear strategy in and then fading\nFading to obtain parliamentary approval okay anyhow I thought I'd share that with or you are the best way to maintain NATO's credibility\nAnd to be taken seriously by the U.S is to work seriously towards the alliance I'm a target for a defense and um you know and to work with that\nAnyhow also of course as Donald president Donald Trump has claimed that Europe doesn't want to spend four armament and a part of the reason is that Europe is tired of fighting each other each country another they've learned that working together peacefully benefits everybody\nAnd or why spend money for something that you don't want to used on the road so Europe has gotten really tired of wars which is\nA good thing and I hope they ... they don't go to war ever again and then they they be example in a bright light for the rest of the war let's ...\nRight well
