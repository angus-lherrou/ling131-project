about privacy aren't all that new in fact there were a rash of technologies in the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds that me people feel like privacy was being stolen from them technologies like photography particularly instant photography and mass\nMedia and if you can believe it postcards\nWhen postcards came on board of course anyone could read the back of a postcard from the mail carrier to a nosy neighbor and so there's this you know small but I think very interesting and telling kerfuffle around the etiquette of postcard writing that people shouldn't be spilling their secrets um these cards\nThe rise of telephones also seemed to many in the public like a serious violation of privacy\nTelephone operators wire tappers of various sorts party lines in um domestic telephone communications all of these men that people were communicating with each other about private matters but that\nA whole bunch of people could potentially at any point be listening in and the same was true for the telegraph in terms of communications ever telegraph cables both a government and criminals of various sorts it was well known could could tap into those communications\nSarah I goes new book is the known citizen a history of privacy in modern America\nAnd she argues that the story of privacy isn't linear we didn't have a whole bunch of privacy and some previous era that we continue to lose piece by piece what we want what we demand what we hope for it keeps changing which brings us back to\nCourt but when she got the state level an appeal she lost her loss enraged the public the chief judge Bolton Parker said there was no quote so called right to privacy Parker was pilloried but\nHe went on to run for president against Theodore Roosevelt and if you've never heard of ... and Parker well you know what happened in that election the U.S meanwhile kept grappling with new inventions and ideas that required often compromises in our privacy\nSocial Security numbers were one of those that that I think Americans really weighed and made a trade off about that this number which did allow the government to track ones earnings and uh employment history and sometimes health history as well\nThat that it was worth it to have economic security and so in the Nineteen thirties there are certainly debates about this number a the the Social Security number and we all know and um maybe love and there are lots of debates about it but in the end Americans are are pretty willing to have that number in exchange for economic writes an economic security\nBy the Nineteen sixties and seventies the nature of debates about privacy we're changing in some ways people are growing more open which we will get to but in some ways they wanted more autonomy enter in Nineteen sixty five Supreme Court case Griswold versus Connecticut\nYour personal details unless you've very carefully and deliberately opted out and that really rivers as Danah boyd has written about this really nicely that really reversed a tradition where it was actually hard to get information it was hard to get information out and to circulate it it it flip flop that\nSo that that was it a hugely important part of the Internet and the way that it's intersected with privacy debates it also of course gave Americans who have long um many long wanted an audience of some kind right and a kind of influence and reach\nExactly that gave them a platform for their blog for their thoughts for you know sharing their photographs of their meals [laughter] you know giving allowing their friends to see their movements\nHe's in the uh ability of now many many many people to look into and use that information in ways that we are not always intended of course by the people who put it out there to begin with\n[laughter] let me just take a step out of history here for a minute ... will step back into it for a minute but\nI think in some ways people think of like history is a story of privacy being off straight you know your last summer with the with uh the telephone people can listen in to calls and the telegraph and then the Internet and you know and closed circuit TV cameras all of our city that you just keep going and people know more and more about you\nBut in some sense if I if you think back to like medieval in London or something people living very close together walls being not very thick you can just hear what people are saying on the other side you know or people in living in very small villages in small communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody's business\nIn some ways like tomorrow if I Walk through Rio or Beijing or like New York city but he would know who I was I mean I can walk through anonymously and maybe privately I mean in some ways I feel like\nYou could argue that we maybe have more privacy than we had hundreds of years ago\n[noise] absolutely I think this is what has missed often in our contemporary debates this idea that the privacy of some things I'm quantity that was there once and is now gone and or eroding slipping for our fingers but no it's true that we live privately more privately in many ways then did people a couple of centuries ago\nIn terms of a White House construction ways that neighborhoods are designed homes are designed but also in terms of our very right center sensibilities sense of what should be private um has changed and so\nIt I think it's really a mistake to think about privacy is all moving in one direction um this is what makes it hard to chart and hard to kind of place at any given point\nMore privacy I think some ways in ways we live in a way we think about ourselves as private up people who ought not to have the state or neighbors peering in through our windows all the time\nSo what's your diagnosis of where we are now are we in like a lot less private than we were a hundred years ago\nI don't think so but I Do think that the substance of our privacy in our ideas about privacy rights\nOr have changed and changed in conjunction with all kinds of things technological developments date developments a commercial or and so on architectural even\nI think if I were to describe our current moment I think what we're experiencing are two different trajectory is coming together and have created a lot of problems I'm One of them is the ability for many different agencies to know us very well um by matching emerging technologies\nThe other is this a impetus a that many citizens have had since the Nineteen seventies to\nDisclose more of their authentic selves on different kinds of media platforms those are coming together in ways that are I think um we're unanticipated and which have meant that there is a ton of information out there about us some of it uh kept by record keepers some of it disclosed voluntarily by us um\nAnd and then we've got we're in this technological and commercial moment where all of that is valuable to others and there are many many ways to harness it so those two things have come together they didn't they didn't necessarily have to come together but they have and I think that explains are\nA scandal late in the moment you

tried to enforce existing laws they also put forth a campaign around friends don't let friends drive drunk and that was actually invented by a group in Canada but mad had the chapters in the local

years back there is a farmer rancher and a west Texas in arid west Texas a by the name of Williams Jeff Williams\nWilliams and his family had their rights to a ton of water in Texas did they could pump out of the aquifer under their land no matter how dry Texas got to the state Supreme Court had told them\nWhat it basically comes down to is that an individual landowner has the right to literally pull up is\nIt boils down to whoever has the biggest pump wins in the Williams is among the the bigger pumps\nMcGraw is the author of a Thursday land the making of an American water crisis he said that what Jeff Williams could not do by law we ship the water to other people who needed it\nEven when drought began to play in Texas in two thousand ten and even when that drought was forcing

Antonio today\nWere it not for the technological advancements that have taken place and particularly took place in the post war here\nToo so the implication is here that we put too many people um or that they put themselves in the Las Vegas is in the Phoenix is in the past those certainly given the amount of water that we have in those places and\nI'll I'll just say on behalf of those people like what I mean these are major areas of economic importance and cultural importance are you saying in Thirty years they're going to turn on the tap and water is not going to come out\nNow here's here's
