meeting proud sponsor of how I built this entrepreneur summit taking place in San Francisco ... censor October sixteenth more about the summit at NPR dot org slash summit\nAndy any EKG foundation\nInvasion and turn it like\nFor some people there is no single defining moment in their lives for Hugh Thompson a funeral director from Stone Mountain Georgia there was [noise] he was only in his twenties for the moment came when you look at the moment that when they find him for good and bad\nAnd on march sixteenth Nineteen sixty eight he was looking for the enemy from a helicopter\nWhat he found with Americans killing noncombatants in an area where poor patents mostly farm to write\nThompson had stumbled onto what would become known as the ... massacre he talked about it with the BBC Nineteen eighty nine\nI remember so once you learn how to these people get a ditch family so that the ah [noise] ah Nazis I guess march and everybody down into a ditch and blowing them away\nHere we are supposed to be the good guys and the white hat\nHugh Thompson had several choices in that moment he could say nothing to his fellow Americans he could join in with the soldiers on the ground or get try to stop them but given our biology and the culture that has been built on top of it trying to stop fellow Americans that was going to be pretty tough\nWe are primates we are ... like a whole lot of them we are very very hard wired to divide the world and to us as ...\nRoberts opposed gave the professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University we process\nOf them in group\nOut group a categorization rooms in\nUnder a hundred milliseconds in our brains and neuro imaging studies there are hormones that exacerbated the contrast between us being nice to us as being very\nAntisocial to them it's incredibly hard wired and\nI Would venture to say unless you're the the Dalai Lama and his friends basically all of us carry in us say capacity to make rapid us with M. distinctions to not be all that nice\nAnd who was it them\nShoot Thompson a lifetime of you know American nationalist sort of implications to listen to us\nAs well as others will challenge

and then what's going on any more civilians\n[laughter] I don't know [noise]\nI don't know how to self if they would have opened up on that particular day I wouldn't have given it a second so\n\nThey were the image that time I guess every day I'm sure they will make it was said on the ground\nThompson confronted lieutenant William ... was in command\nBecause they don't make any sense and they're not meaningful outside the context of the environment which may occur\nAnd this notion that there's a bucket that's sort of genetic back it and the cultural back it it sounds like not at all they're just there's so much porous between those buckets that you can actually you you can't separate one from the other\nExactly here and looking to innovation have him carrying the alarm talking with Robert ... professor of biology and neurology at Stanford he's the author of the have the biology of humans at our best and worst [noise]\nSo we talked about culture we've talked about genetic if both of those have tremendous power very often beyond your control you you don't change the culture or your\nWell and our ability to shape our own lives\nWell if you spend enough time looking at how we are shaped by everything from\nA subliminal sensory stimulus ten seconds ago to why humans evolved the way they are rather than being chimps urban ... and everything in between you spend enough time with that\nAnd you know that concept of free will start seeming mighty suspect ... one can argue till the cows come home with certain branches of philosophers but in terms of that I come out as what's termed a heart determinist I don't think there's a shredder free will out there\nUm I think free will is what we call the biology that hasn't been uncovered yet\nAnd when you look at the history of our knowledge\nAbout what biology has to do with behavior\nWe've spent the last couple of centuries or so over and over repeating the same phrase which is why I had no idea that sort of biology had anything to do with it\nWell I had no idea that an epileptic seizure\nIs a disease rather than someone who's been consulting with Satan mhm oh I had no idea circa Nineteen fifties that a child has a lot of trouble learning to read rather than being lazy and on motivated has the cortical mal formations that we now call a learning disability and when you look at\nThe sheer percentage of what we know\nAbout the biological shaping of our behavior [noise]\nNinety five percent of it was discovered in the last half century Ninety percent of in the last twenty five years eighty five percent since you woke up this morning and all that it's been happening is this endless march of oh I had no idea buyouts\nAnd at the end of the day either you could conclude there's no free will whatsoever and that's my spouse\nOr at least you're going to have to admit there's a lot less free will than there used to be\nIn sort of western thinking in western values and judgments\nAnd it's getting squeezed into all sorts of really uninteresting places and that's just going to keep happening and maybe down the line if you want to insist that was free will while you floss your upper teeth this morning instead of your lower ones go for it be happy but\nI think by all logic again this notion free will is just the biology we haven't discovered yet [noise]\nDoes that mean you must think that all the time in your own life you know am I really think it'd be interesting primates are as being maintenance making it again and\nI really choosing not to eat that cookie or that already kind of baked into like who I mean do you think that all the time in your own life\nWill that's the problem um you know mid again I'm\nTotally intellectually comfortable with the notion that there is no free will whatsoever it's a myth we are nothing more or less in our biology at the same time I haven't the remotest idea how you're supposed to live a few actually started believing Andre there's obvious things to do which is completely revamp\nHow we do criminal justice and education and cultures of others things like that but at the end of the day like you know without question I showed that I'm a total hypocrite and there's not really incorporate\nAgain [laughter] like if I give a lecture and somebody comes up afterward and says oh good lecture I'll say thanks how that's what I'm supposed to say no actually it's this amount to how my having adequate protein levels as ...\nA certain level [noise] if it's good to be hard for us to accept that there is no free will when it comes to judging them and they're awful behaviors I'm going to be that much harder to acceptance absolutely justice applicable when it comes to us in our laudable once\nI Want to go back to sending you just mentioned the criminal justice system so believing what you do you think about this and that's all about choices people make and then tell other people obviously choose to punish them or not punish them uh for for what they did\nWell not not to sound like too much of a hothead here as if I haven't already but\nLet's see just to sort of state it subtly the criminal justice system makes no sense whatsoever\nThere's there's no souls there's no evil there's no there's no punishment that in and of itself I mean none of this stuff makes sense that the criminal justice system runs on neurobiology that's close to two hundred years old\nLiterally in what's called the ... ruling the different species of knowing between right and wrong and other than that for the most parts ignored the last two hundred years of behavior science [noise]\nTwenty five percent of the men on death row in this country has a history of concussive head trauma to their frontal cortex\nAnd when you damage the frontal cortex\nUs somebody who can know the difference between right and wrong and they still can't regulate their behavior and when they do something appalling at that point invoking evil it makes much sense as invoking the notion of even when a car who's breaks the failed hit somebody ...\nAnd in both cases you don't leave them out on the street being dangerous but\nWhen you put a car and a garage because he can't fix the brakes and it's dangerous you don't sit there and say justice\nA mechanical problem and in a horribly simplified way we're biological machines and if it's ... to turn this into machines and that way it's a hell of a lot better than demonizing us into having rotten souls when we may just have something screw with wonder transmit or system\nIn some ways the argument that you make really affects huge swaths of our culture it it seems to me and like\nI think about the entire section of a bookstore [laughter] right that's designed to help you succeed more in life so that the you know books to help you find that to help you succeed at word books to help you do well in school I can make friends better um\nBut in some ways there is no need for that section if it's pre determined whether you're going to succeed at work or you're going to make friends or you're not\nWill but nonetheless you've got to incorporate the fact and their behavior changes yeah\nAnd it's not determine a stick in the sense that like a puritan neurobiologist would have set a Plymouth Rock or something right right but it's instead in a much more interesting hopeful way for example\nI'm conventional language that we would use you sit there and you hear about the story of Hugh Thompson and you come out of their inspired right inspired\nShe did something amazing inspired\nThere was nothing extraordinary about his upbringing\nInspired five minutes before that he was no more amazing when you were me put his pants on one leg at a time it's after a while maybe I could be more like Hugh Thompson mhm so we've just given sort of an English description of what it is to be inspired by somebody\nWhat does that neural biologically and the fact that a human can do what he did\nAnd the fact that you just heard about it might very well\nAnd now involved in a sense of Africa see ... and doing the right thing with the terrifying thing to do\nWhen you were inspired when you're demoralized when you're deflated when you're bore you buy something those are as biological phenomena as anything else and they leave their traces so the fact that\nWe can learn about the nature of the world\nAnd the process by definition\nThat changes the nature of our brain that are subsequent behaviors um is totally compatible with us as determined to stick biological organisms it just tells you go when study what the most efficacious ways or to like bring about good changes and those friends of ours [noise]\nRabbits oppose ... is professor of biology and neurology at Stanford she's the author of the hate the biology of humans at our best and worst Robert thank you so much thanks for having me on [noise]\nBecause they said on the African Americans were not allowed to buy the land that the amusement park was located on okay\nWith that in the law that average are not allowed to buy that land\nWas not the law so that African Americans couldn't bought a land it was there were restrictions in the deed of the land okay that you could not be sold to African Americans okay okay um this was a racially restrictive covenant a common place way in which racial segregation was enforced in America and the Jim Crow era\nAnd the court nonetheless ruled in favor of the amusement park saying that uh the amusement park was not owned by African Americans was owned by a corporation corporation may have been run by African Americans but the corporation had no race itself the court said I'm\nA and a really highlights and interesting and unexpected phenomenon I found in looking at the history of corporate rights is that\nIn many ways it the rights of corporations became tied up with questions of race slavery and civil rights\nJust like almost anything else in American history\nTo go back to Mitt Romney that that famous quote you know corporations are people couldn't you argue and I I I guess corporations' probably has that you know look corporations are a collection of people and\nWhatever it is they are fighting to keep their workforce to not have to lay people off to be profitable to share those profits um\nIsn't that in some you know I think ... you know people derided Mitt Romney but isn't that a reasonable way to look at things that corporations are a collection of people and they're trying to act in their best interest\nThat is exactly the way the Supreme Court has tended to view corporations over the course of American history and the for all the controversy over corporate personhood\nCitizens United never relies on that idea at all and in fact what I find in my book is that\nIf you look at the history of Supreme Court cases extending rights to corporations\nWe find that most of those cases the Supreme Court rejects the idea of corporate personhood and says instead the corporations are associations of people and that people come together in the corporate form and they shouldn't\nLose their rights when they do so but there are some interesting questions about who really belongs to the corporation one Hobby Lobby refuses to provide birth control is required under federal law\nIn health care plans for employees\nUm that's you know ten thousand female employees who are adversely affected by that notion that is made by a to pursue the interests of the four or five owners of the Hobby Lobby company um whose interest really should be a recognized the the people who contribute the money or the people who contribute the labor and everything else\nCan you imagine a whole bunch more cases coming down the pike like as more CEOs\nGet active and get involved um I think a bank of America that just a few months ago said they don't want to finance companies that that make a weapons like the air Fifteen ah we've seen Patagonia sue the Trump Administration over a national monuments and protection national monuments I just wonder if there's going to be a whole\nNew crop of these cases\nCases and we're seeing lawsuits brought against graphics cigarette warnings we're seeing lawsuits brought against conflict\nMineral disclosures under the securities laws and and do you buy one study a full fifty percent of
