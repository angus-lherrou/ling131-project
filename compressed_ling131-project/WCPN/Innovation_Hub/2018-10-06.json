last few months in large chunk of my conversations has veered towards a single topic [noise] after a while I got a little obsessed with the topic and he started asking people about it directly that generally unless that his size and grown and comments that sounded a little like that I feel serious\nI feel you feel a little bit on patients uh it's really stressful\nAm initially angry and then I settle in and say turn of the tunes gets bought out by going and just relax it's either that or take a Xanax and I don't have a prescription yes\nThose were commuters we tracked down in Atlanta and Chicago and they're talking of course about traffic\nSomething that affects the health mental state wallets family life and worked options as so many Americans which kind of makes you wonder could traffic be fixed or is it just destined to track us in our cars for more and more times each year\nThere's general agreement the congestion in our major urban areas is getting worse\nMichael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at UCLA Luskin school of public affairs his focus is traffic and he says if you live in or near a major urban area you probably spend a chunk of your day in gridlock\nLos Angeles New York Washington DC that metropolitan area San Francisco Boston\nChicago Atlanta in general the bigger and denser city you are the more traffic congestion erodes house\nRush hours have expanded as we try to avoid driving at the worst times a day stresses grown as people grapple with the unpredictability of traffic so when it could take thirty minutes to get to work and the next day takes fifty and the costs going in there\nOne of the most under appreciated impacts of traffic congestion is the pollution that results from it\nWhen vehicles are idling and moving slowly are just going stop and go around ten to Fifteen miles an hour they amid much more pollution or they make more carbon and which is sort of matters for climate change and sort of these global concerns but at a local level they're likely to him that much more sort of what we called local missions\nDid with increases an asthma increase in other respiratory diseases or increases and cancer and most especially increases in a premature birth on low birth weight\nThose costs men bill says are mostly born by people whose homes are between five hundred thousand feet from the congested road which means that not all of the costs associated with traffic are paid by people who drive a lot\nOf the drivers who suffer from\nLast time it's the drivers who suffer from stress it's the drivers who suffer from most crashes\nBut you also have people who just live near freeways and those folks tend to be a much lower income than the population at large and they breathe or very polluted air\nTruly me until he spent some serious energy thinking about how you make traffic better noticeably better now politicians also say they want to make traffic better by Mandela argues they've tended to embrace solutions that the evidence doesn't quite bear out\nCertainly the most longstanding approach to fighting traffic congestion has been to build more roads\nRight and that could be building entire roads which we don't do very much any more or it could be widening existing roads which was very very popular in sort of the last decades the twentieth century and we still do some of much more in some parts of the country than others but like you know\nWhere they take money paid by folks who can afford it and use it to help subsidize access to the goods for people who have less money there's absolutely no reason\nThat we couldn't do the same thing with congestion prices\nHow do you know it works and where has it been tried and like where can I go to see that\nOkay so I think there's two ways to think about this one is that if you just think conceptually about what traffic congestion is\nThen you you understand the pricing is the only thing that solve that problem so again if you understand the congestion results because of very valuable asset is under priced and so as a result too many people want to use it at a particular time\nThan just logically the ...\nWas just the the logical or conceptual basis behind it if you want to see it in action Singapore has used some version of congestion pricing since Nineteen Seventy five I Believe wow and it has used sort of more sophisticated electronic road pricing since the late Nineteen nineties early to thousands\nOf Singapore is a very dense city it's desert in San Francisco\nIt's freeways move pretty consistently at fifty five or sixty miles an hour oh you can also see examples of this along certain what we call high occupancy toll lanes throughout the United states that's our Ninety One roadway in in orange county for instance is a great example it's congestion priced roadway that sits in the middle of a free\nFreeway in orange county okay and during rush hour you will see traffic snarled in the free lanes and zipping right along at fifty five sixty miles an hour in the price planes\nA variant of congestion pricing is it at work in places like London in Stockholm where driving into the center of the city and this is not freeways but this is driving into the downtown you encourage charged to do so\nUh that has been very successful as well the first day of London's congestion charging traffic delay went down by about thirty five percent\n[noise] so this is an issue that crosses party lines it's not part isn't doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you're you know stuck in traffic every morning\nOn but I have not heard a lot of politicians talk about it do you see we've kind of a local thing but do you see mayors governors I'm Talking about this doing congestion pricing really trying to uh make people's commute a better\nSo congestion is absolutely a much bigger priority at the local and sometimes the state level than it is at the national level right it's not something that the national government has a lot of concern or thoughts\nJust in bad they say yes but if you ask them like name the top three problems in your region only a handful of reagents just congestion rank really high mhm so I think it it becomes much more an issue that mayors and city council members out and in smaller states like Massachusetts governors tackle and the question of you know\nDo I see these little acted officials embracing congestion pricing what I Would say optimistically is that more people are willing to talk about it now than they were ten years ago\nI think it's a hard political cell I mean this is people are very accustomed to the roads being free\nThey're also very accustomed to unfortunately policymakers having told them to other things would solve congestion being told that because we're building transit or adding road capacity the problem was going to get better\nSo I think it's been difficult to sort of go back on that and say actually we were wrong the only thing that's going to solve this is pricing\nBut I I'm optimistic that as more and more places many of them outside the United states uh experiment with is\nMayors in the United states will look around and say you know there's no reason we shouldn't be part\nOf the success [noise] Michael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at the UCLA unless ... school of public affairs his research focuses on traffic Michael thank you so much for having\nNo no no no\nUm [noise]\nMy name and then\nYou heard from some commuters in Atlanta and Chicago at the beginning of the segment but we asked us for the world will look like without traffic\nI could not imagine leaning on traffic are we talking about the Tesla a super underground tunnels train\nIt would be a good question I I find more people live out there if they didn't have to deal with Ofeibea commute\nWow Chicago would be absolutely amazing I I Love the city but it's so car centric\nReally frustrating

she talked about how sort of paradoxically it can be a really good thing for you so you know it can motivate people to be good parents to be good students whatever um but she also said it's got this dark side what she called hubris stick pride so here she is talking about that\nIt's our research shows that people who tend to feel this kind of hubris to pride have problematic friendships right they they have trouble making friends and keeping friends because really what they value more is boosting themselves up at the expense of their friends so they'll put others down to feel good about themselves they'll have aggressively to try to get power and control\nAnd so the result of that is behaviors that can be really destructive like cheating in line\n[noise] jak Lewis I'm probably as one
