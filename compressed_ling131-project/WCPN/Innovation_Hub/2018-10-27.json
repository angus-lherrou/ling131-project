those that are new on the scene will technology obviously\nExcept says historian Lewis Hyman\nNot really he says American businesses have loved the idea of freelancing for a long time not just in this era of Internet startups in very low unemployment rates and the shift in the economy that we're seeing not about tack it's about us and the choices we make\nLewis timing is an associate professor of economic history at Cornell University he's the author of temp\nHow American work American business in the American dream became temporary Lewis thanks for your time a real pleasure to be here thank you so when you hear people say things and I'm sure this comes across a your dirt desk every now and again but people saying you know like\nShe because of the Internet you know so much work is now cobbled together and there's not that much security there's so much freelancing [noise]\nWhat do you think when you hear that kind of complaint\nIt's really interesting to me because there's a way in which technology acquires sort of an air of inevitability that there's nothing that can be done this is just the future it's algorithms futuristic robots and in the book I really\nDrive change it consolidate said and things that you think happened in the last few years that are being driven by apps are really the byproduct of you know the rise of a certain kind of service economy that has been insecure increasingly insecure and unequal for quite some time\nAnd so you wouldn't say then I guess that technology has always driven things and I think people think like\nTechnology is the reason we had the industrial revolution right that if the ... you hadn't had automatic looms then that never would have happened in that the Internet is like I said you know the reason that all this temporary work has happened ... you just sort of don't buy that argument\nI don't and I don't think many historians do either it's really important to realize and it's and it's a story we're told so there's a reason why I Do think it's not just because they're you know confused at there this is a story we're told that the story of progress the story of technology you know the cotton gin and the steam engine and the railroad\nBut before all that was made possible there was a social reorganization of people are from their homes into the factories\nAnd the what historians called industrious revolution which preceded the industrial revolution by about a hundred years the ... revolution the industry is Rob a bank not that people became suddenly moral and hardworking but that they were\nPut into rooms together and supervised and you know they were weaving textiles they were\nYou know making pots pottery and it had nothing to do with technology and how to do with simply\nOrganizing people in a row and watching them this is where Adam Smith famous example of pin manufacturing came from right it wasn't you know the idea of division of labor that you know one person could make you know fewer I sat down and make a PIN we could make like three pin I could make zero pins I'm not very high but it makes you know that but let's\nStep suddenly oh maybe I can I can definitely hit something in a certain way again and again and again and that these Skilling of work that division of labor this is the foundation of\nCapitalism and a lot of ways it's one of the foundations of capitalism and this is what we're seeing today that the corporation fundamentally was reorganized sometime or between Nineteen Seventy Nineteen eighty\nIn a new way that created more insecure lives for the rest of us and ... is the waste product of that service economy it's the it's only possible because the rest of our work lives at Starbucks and Wal Mart or so bad\nSo if what you're saying is in some sense factories were created before the kinds of factors we think about where so many things are automatic and electric powered\nTalk about then how the gig economy was there before even before the Internet forget Hoover and the Internet ever came on but it was really there before\nAbsolutely so in the book I talk about temp jobs and by temp jobs I mean jobs that are loosely affiliated with a corporation or a workplace and you can see them and all kinds of ways from consultants which are well paid to temps which are run through an agency to migrant laborers\nOr which are pretty much shut out of any kind of legal protections or workplace rights so\nThe story really begins after World War two when the first temp agencies come into being when the first\nConsulting fees really comes to the foreground so here I'm Talking about manpower incorporated as the for for runner the temp agency and McKinsey and company as a foreigner of consultants and of course at the same time the ... program which brought guest workers from Mexico to the U.S for the very first time\nTalk a little bit about manpower ... which is still going strong it's a company that exist today\nAnd and what it was hoping to do and sort of how it ended up changing America\nSo all these different kinds of temp work really whereabouts supporting that postwar corporation that was focused on security focused on stability and long term jobs and so the founder of manpower incorporated Elmer winter was a lawyer\nIn Milwaukee and one day he had a crisis where he needed a secretary to type up some legal notes and he didn't have one so he\nCalled around you couldn't find somebody and he realized that this was not a problem this was an opportunity like so many entrepreneurs and so he spouted manpower as a way to supply emergency replacement labor for\nBusiness executives and for companies and this was a tremendous growth business they exploded through the Nineteen fifties\nBy the Nineteen end of the Nineteen fifties he realized there was a limit to how often secretaries got sick or ... you know people went on vacation and you begin to imagine a different kind of workforce of workforce that could come in as needed that can be a permanent like temporary workforce\nAnd yet people didn't do it and they didn't do it because of the reasons they didn't have the experience with it they trust of the people that they knew\nAnd they didn't quite believe that that was the purpose of the company the purpose of the company was to provide security to provide long term investments and all the things that are missing in the meaning of the corporation today\nSo then how did he had had manpower convinced corporations can take that next step not just you know replace somebody while they were having surgery or like you said like went on vacation but um you know gee I'm One\nOf your work place or a lot of the people who work you know with you interchangeable you don't\nWas something called the computer that became really important in the mid Nineteen sixties especially the system three sixty by IBM and corporations were entranced by it they were entranced by this idea of moving all their paper records to destroy records\nAnd or other I guess analog since it was magnetic tape but it is is is the sequester is a huge amount of work\nAnd so they look to manpower to make that transition and they hired you know shift and ships and shifts of women as data entry operators and they were like\nWow that's amazing we could just take something that's important to us and then just hire manpower to do it and they had this experience with\nOutsourcing for the very first time something that was court to their own business so this is an experience that lots of corporations are having the late Nineteen sixties\nAnd then comes a huge crisis in Nineteen sixty nine an intellectual crisis for the corporation where suddenly the conglomerate which had been the sort of a ... through the Nineteen sixties as

industrial revolution started by\nBy the U.S has especially accelerated it seems to me since the late Nineteen seventies or in the early eighties\nI've ended jobs in communities especially in places like Ohio where he grew up\nAnd at first it seemed like great promise and there have obviously been many benefits of all of this technological change but I think one of the very destructive parts of it has been that it has contributed to this erosion of community\nThat erosion Alexander says it's been particularly powerful in states where factories have substituted robots for people and were solid blue collar jobs now feel scarce but for those who are part of building the technology that drives our lives these sorts of changes have been going on for well ever\nIn the early eighties the job of being a switchboard operator was on its way out\nDaniel Theobald cofounded the robotics company ... and he now serves as their chief innovation officer\nAt Nineteen eighty four eighty and she had forty thousand switchboard operators today you know a handful at most and nobody really uh that I Know of is really lamenting the loss of the ability to sit behind a desk and plug wires in and out of the switchboard all day long it wasn't great work\nBut the other side of the equation is really interesting for me at least and that is if you were to try and handle today's communications\nUsing switchboard operators it would take many many times the population of the entire earth\nTechnologies the about argues change they always have people who made their living constructing horse drawn carriage who made dresses to order who had had shops at a time when men and women thought it was undignified to go out without a hat all those jobs more or less ultimately came to an end you can't turn back time\nYou know we have one point seven seven six trillion dollars of our Indian\nJust an engineer you've ever lived are alive today\nFormer deputy assistant secretary of defense for research Melissa flags says that even if America wanted to stop the advance of the sorts of technologies that can lead to fewer workers and car manufacturing plants we couldn't really the economy is to ...\nThis time but that were harkening back to doesn't exist\nAnd so the question isn't\nOh we rushed into it the world has already gone there and in order for us to think about fundamentally improving the lives of the next several generations\nWe have to actually asking them to help us figure out how do you transform were or build totally new types of communities I Do think we're going to have to accept that\nAs new things are created some things that we remember when the soldier will no longer exist\nFlag is now the northeast region lead at the U.S army research laboratory\nAnd she and Daniel Theobald who started the robotics company agree that the march of technology offers incredible potential for making our lives better but in the short term they say our responsibility is to pay a lot more attention to people who have been displaced\nYou know when the when the person who's been working a certain type of job almost all of their life feels threatened that the world is going to change because of technology that's the real issue and that's a real hard issue to deal with\nSo uh you know we need to do a better job in this country of taking care of those people have training workers of retraining workers of heaven continuing education but to to blame the robots will Timothy is counterproductive because we will end up in a place where we can't take care of the exact people that that we're trying to protect\nDo you feel like I mean you spent I think pretty much your entire adult life making robots doesn't feel strange when you hear\nYou know people feeling really alienated and upset because of sort of what technology in robotics doing does it feel weird to be a person who creates robots\nYeah it does you know one thing that to is really important for me throughout the throughout that period of building robots as well as we've really been focused on this idea of how do you encourage humanity how do you make life better for people\nThat's got to be the primary focus and I believe very strongly that technology can do that and by and large technology has done that all the way back to the stone age\nI'm Melissa and I know you grow up in Missouri and your family had and actually has now or a cotton farming Arkansas talk about what you see not in Silicon valley not maybe in Boston or New York uh but they're\nMy hometown Sykes and trucking is the main industry there so there's a lot of conversation that I've had with let's see I Know who live in like stunned and their thoughts about listening to conversations about automation\nAnd they're scared and an angry that people talk about it like it's exciting rather than talking about the impact when I go to the farm the flip side is it's allowed small farms to continue to exist and to actually make enough money to be relevant for families\nIn ways that we couldn't have otherwise because having precision grading and no till farming and\nQuite frankly Roundup Ready cotton and things like this that have allowed us to do\nFarming with fewer people right I mean those\nTractors are basically robots that have satellite precision you know place the input here and so it's kind of incredible to see both sides of it where it's really enabled individual families to farm in a way that they could never have done in its increase the yield of this land\nYou start to have those conversations across communities in the same town it's really exciting because then you start to see these debates between people who really trust each other\nAnd that's an intriguing again it's it's that having the technologist in charge of the conversation is tricky and you learn in D O D because\nEvery single thing that a soldier or an airman or a sailor or marine uses a ship a jet right\nA submarine thirties incredible pieces of technology that these are kids that came out of my home town right and we've trained them to be in this universe Henry credibly high tech\nAnd so there are these incredible translators between hey you know it can enable you and you can use it an amazing ways and you don't have to be a PHD computer scientist to do it\nYou're listening to innovation hub I'm ... I'm Talking with Daniel Theobald co founder and chief innovation officer of ... robotics and must have flagged the northeast regional lead at the U.S army research lab Danielle\nLet's talk about another strand of this conversation uh which I think probably doesn't get talked a lot about 'em in in most media because we're very busy having the jobs in technology conversation\nBut I Wonder how much people in technology worry um that the U.S and maybe because of some of these concerns is falling behind in the world in terms of robotics and automation or you know are we doing great and don't worry about it\nYou know because we have a very high standard of living here and because you know we're several generations and from significant events in the world like World War two et cetera we sometimes forget that the prosperity we have here in the U.S was hard fought it wasn't something that just magically happened but\nThink about the larger global community and helping everybody do well but there are a lot of economists out there that are highly highly motivated to win to improve their standard of living to invest heavily in robotics and technology because what they realized is\nWhoever owns that technology at the end of the day is going to have a leg up on every other region in the world\n... molested do you share those concerns do you worry that the U.S is falling behind when it comes to sort of creating cutting edge technology", "show_name": "Innovation Hub", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "27"}
