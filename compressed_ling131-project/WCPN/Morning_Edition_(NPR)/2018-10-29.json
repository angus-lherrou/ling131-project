often drives the hours one way to Stanford healthcare just south of San Francisco\nI had this rash that wouldn't go away [noise] she got that rash last winter ever horseback riding and it lasted four months it was itchy and wait to read the like poison oak she made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford\nAnd she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb near ... and\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBends pain color phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put him into a tiny plastic capsule and then they do a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSaid that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back\nIt's an was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it out of four cylinder six or under its or engine does it have the top of the wind blew to stereo system or does it have the more

dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pill\nAnd that grand piano Winston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get ...\nHow could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes

they put her into a tiny plastic capsule many drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic

nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars\nNews thank you so much thanks [noise]\n\nSupport for

she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith

does negotiating that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's an incredibly weaken position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek reelection until uh twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically going to remain in power until
