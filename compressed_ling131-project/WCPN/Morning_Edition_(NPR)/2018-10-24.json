their power in this fall state elections Democrats want to take some of that power away\nYou know the old in the head a faith based approach to mid term elections they always say that the candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning for years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures\nState lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense\nAgainst that regression to the mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber yes\nYou have a one seat majorities and Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nWhat you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing the district lines that's where they came from right well I Would\nRaise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed has to have local represented that people can count on carrying the interests of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin\nSend you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical but what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country how if at all do\nYou advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is to understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government and I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically it'd be more focus on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents

with residents of Mount Pleasant to share their personal experiences the result is Cleveland stories volume one idea streams carry ... spoke with Charlotte Morgan or writing teacher in participant in the project\nAs well as Lee chill co director of literary Cleveland\nThe mission of Cleveland is to nurture a vibrant literary arts community in northeast Ohio and one of the ways that we do that is by inviting people to write\nAnd certainly Mount Pleasant and the African American community that lives in Mount pleasant and surrounding neighborhoods don't have the same access to writing programs as other parts of the city\nThere's also a high illiteracy rate in the community and we partnered with seeds of literacy a neighborhood connections to bring a writing program there that would help folks to tell their stories and tell the story of their neighborhood\nBut also to help teach others how to share there's I think the thing\nThat I've learned over the course of my time as a journalist is that people hold stories and their stories are just better than fiction you know true stories are\nJust fascinating and so I find myself with this opportunity to meet some people from a community I didn't know that much about and hadn't visited in many years and when I found were people who were simple plain people\nWho some of them were battling illiteracy but all of them had a deep reach story to share with us and I was just blown away\nBy the quality of the story telling that I was introduced to from these people great great storytellers from a tradition of storytelling families and that's what made it really work\nLeave what kind of stories did people submit\nYou know we were really blown away by the submissions they were a very personal surprising funny sometimes tragic but also hopeful there were stories about growing up in the neighborhood\nAbout families that had migrated from the south to the north during the great migration pieces about sort of looking beyond the easy labels are or stereotypes of the neighborhood but they also didn't shy away from the tough issues so there are pieces about crime in foreclosure and end homelessness as well\n... how did you put everything together so it tells the story together\nSo what we tried to do was um was take submissions from workshop participants and just edit those submissions so that they you know told a

EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep Republicans want to preserve their power and this fall state elections Democrats want to take some of that power away\nYou know the audience they had a faith based approach to mid term elections you always right if the cat is would win but we didn't do much else democratic\nChairman Tom ... is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning for years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools\nSees his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense um when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve where Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority\nFirst and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful as understand their district an advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election and two thousand eight team well\nCertainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nPrize in local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive\nA and a more conservative
