overview one\nOf the highest profile duties of the secretary of state was on trial this year and the U.S Supreme Court upheld Ohio's six year voter roll maintenance process\nBy which voters are removed if they don't vote after two years and for the next four years don't vote and don't respond to board of elections mailings\nDemocratic state representative Kathleen Clyde was outspoken against the process which she and other critics call voter purging Clyde notes the court's decision left voter roll upkeep to the states and she says if she wins on day one she would change what she calls the strictest removal process in the country\nSo I kind of wanted out of that back with us\nAll of the voters one way we could do this is move Ohio towards automatic voter registration then government entities are doing the work time behind the scenes registering everyone and keeping the rolls up to date\nRepublican state senator frankly rose had been supportive of the process in the past and after the ruling said it would allow the secretary of state to maintain accurate voter rolls while still being fair to voters now he says he'll make some changes and one idea sounds remarkably similar to clients\nWhat I'm working on right now is a a series of steps that would would bring a more automated of voter registration type processes to the state of Ohio so when people are interacting with state government\nWhich is for most of us at least once a year whether it's paying your taxes are renewing your driver's license getting your fishing licence whatever it may be let's take that

machines that in some cases are a dozen or more years old\nThe state of set aside more than a hundred and fourteen million dollars to get new machines in place by the twenty twenty presidential election but it didn't specify what machines counties must by the rose says that's appropriate the bipartisan boards of elections he says should make those choices\nAt a time when it feels like Republicans and Democrats can't agree on what the other week it is every county in Ohio has a bipartisan success story it is your county board of elections\nSurgeons about what kind of voting machines they want to buy not us sitting in Columbus in dictating it to them\nAround half of Ohio counties have electronic voting machines and the rest use machines that scan paper ballots but both have voter verified paper audit trail Clyde says more voting machines security is needed so she didn't she directed the county's on which machine she wants in her overall cyber security plan\nThere's there'll be a choice and we also have to make sure that we are considering accessibility issues which touch screen machines uh\nHelp some voters with disabilities vote independently so there's you know there's tweak said that we can make but yes the safest most secure voting system as a paper about this up\nOn campaign finance reform there's agreement between the candidates Clyde said she'd support the roses plan to require local candidates to file electronic forms that are more easily searchable and the rose says clients proposal to require more disclosure of donors of so called dark money would
