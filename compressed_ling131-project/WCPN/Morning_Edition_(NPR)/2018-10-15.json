somebody who's held in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs of St Louis realtors association in like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out it was\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with his nurse practitioner ...\nI Know you send a message to the other day and they were having from Shane running out and that was\nStill out but by and large sums improved Jones who was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had

worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this\nFrom the flu it's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and\nThat's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine that and\nHim I was laying awake at night I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my story is as

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous\nWell he does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all of these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally ...\nSee and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable to uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one\nHe was I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp said that Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is more or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has rotten terms or political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political breaks or\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and I and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nThe ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay cop and thanks so much for coming in thank you\nAnd this is NPR News\nIn the ...

is trying to figure out exactly who is behind the disappearance and alleged murder of journalists ...\nThe president told sixty minutes that is the top leadership in Saudi Arabia is responsible there will be severe punishment Saudi Arabia continues to deny any involvement and said that if the U.S imposes sanctions it will retaliate\nThis was one subject covered in a wide ranging interview that aired on CBS last night with President Trump\nNPR's White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from morning good morning so Turkish investigators say a democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be as Saudi has proven to have been behind us he did not and\nUh arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia a and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take a strong action\nAnd he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be yes so this was also in this interview the first time the president has really been pressed on climate change uh since he entered the White House what did he say he didn't he has his position changed at all\nHe said he doesn't think it's a hoax see uh and and he famously before he became president said it was a that that he believes climate change was a hope he said he doesn't think it's a hopes anymore but he still doesn't think it's manmade or it may not be manmade and he said if the climate is changing it may change back\nUh he was really pressed on this why he doesn't believe scientists or or believe some of his own scientists and he said that some scientists have political agendas and and that he's so he would have to figure out what scientists are saying this uh because he thinks that some may be politically motivated by\nOn the highway so we're looking good no accidents or promise report they're off the highway so uh in Lakewood an issue where a train and put extra an accident overnight has closed a about a dozen or so a trained crossings between cook avenue and Web road also cook and Web are both closed between Detroit and Clifton\nUh those should be closed until about seven this morning police are rising motors to simply avoid that area and actually suggesting that you use west Clifton on the west side of lake would ah because it has a river\nLocal businesses that\nMore and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\nSince I'm distorted a sealer but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to outpaced their domestic sales in the past Fifteen or Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nap to any you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that looked like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attack is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nOr which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious because the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise]\nSo that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much uh uh come up as an issue\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what perjury means to Kentucky or he\nWill not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river\nYes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed

eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of around\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nAnd I kind of fish or had an from Shane running out and not much\nHow I still have a call but by and large sums of improved tones

journalists ...\nThe president told sixty minutes that is the top leadership and Saudi Arabia is responsible there will be severe punishment Saudi Arabia continues to deny any involvement and said that if the U.S imposes sanctions it will retaliate this was one subject covered in a while\nEarning good morning so Turkish investigators say a democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad been someone which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be a Saudi has proven to have been behind us he\nDid not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUh and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take a strong\nAction and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be yes so this was also in this interview the first time the president has really been pressed on climate change uh since he entered the White House what did he say he did it has his position changed at all\nSaid he doesn't think it's a hoax see a and as he famously before he became president said it was\nA that that he believes climate change with the hope he said he doesn't think it's a hopes anymore but he still doesn't think it's manmade or it may not be manmade and he said if the climate is changing it may change back\nUh he was really pressed on this why he doesn't believe scientists or or believe some of his own scientists and he said that some scientists have political agendas and and that he's so he would have to figure out what scientists\nAnother check on your morning commute hears jak\nWe

executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nNo coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry sent dirty in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader\nPresident Trump supported with a visit on Saturday we visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system limestone shelf\nThat shell filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it's it's it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\nSince I'm distorted a sealer but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to outpaced their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a NAFTA and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know you have distilleries are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell ah we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attack is no doubt about it so you're either going\nUm or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nStayed in the obviously the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot to that um when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicting feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why would we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh uh come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what perjury means you can Jackie or he\nWill note for the non geographically minded right across\nRight across the river yes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly did this with the district main crush bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen fifty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell you better make thinking jak\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people\nNext we turn to the effort to total damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable roads and non functional phones have made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster ...\nJust on the outskirts

Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but ... says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish

emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be voting because look if the Democrats take it by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts in opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines Trump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus\nTrump for his own personal political\nGoals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is\nWhat is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing and something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overarching goal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different um\nWhat he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is\nBack stabbing the duplicitous and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable to uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in the swamp he\nWas I mean in a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that ... like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump ism or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats and pour the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse the erosion\nOh I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics have gotten more tribal in more vicious than has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nThey caught the end of the Atlantic magazine his profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay cop and thanks so much for coming in thank you\n[noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep in ... thanks so much for tuning in just ahead the marketplace morning report stay with us this Ninety point three WCBS and it's eight fifty support\nFor nutty point three W CPS is provided by\nGreater Cleveland aquarium hosting captain ios haunt aquarium October Nineteen twenties twenty six twenty seventh Halloween pirate party for the kids including magic face painting storytelling and more tickets at greater Cleveland aquarium ...", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "15"}
