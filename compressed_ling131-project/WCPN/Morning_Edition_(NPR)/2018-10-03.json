contentious Senate hearing last week recalled the earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nRobert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay Hi Steve here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations that residents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have any means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen had been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice aid for deceptive chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nOne justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted him off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from birth to Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIf so what was the result is that what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots of judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit both\nAre there been talk of the Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and he seems commentator Cokie Roberts and you can

believes that politicizing the Kavanaugh hearing is a good idea based on his comments last night do Republican leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided\nTo do and I think she'll probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of this and Republicans it took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so
