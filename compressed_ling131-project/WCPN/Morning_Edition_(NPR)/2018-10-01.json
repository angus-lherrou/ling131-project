currently\nAdministration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat's done badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage\nMore than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services\nDoubles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible has met so people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News

and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the proved polling stations\nAnd we were able to watch them start to count some of the

pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you knew anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nA

been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder Carmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nStrong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle and now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of care math median income\nIn Charlotte said a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity atlas where a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods if the area is

is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration that community partnership Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school\nIt's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric ... says the schools students are mostly black\nAnd Hispanic so we have forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body this large minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now and it is\nThe demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut when in the coming years it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nBesides field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because it areas a flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to start making

to a revolution in cancer treatment\nThe November family have two days to ward to soften the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine join to James on this one who ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris going Richard good morning so who are these two winners\nWell the price of being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the empty Anderson Cancer center in Houston and also by to sue ... who's at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years a Nobel Prize comes just a complete surprise male knock this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock of but what exactly did these two scientists do\nI'll start with Jim Allison\nBack in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer so I came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer\nAnd that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment it would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing\nHunter work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... nuts that goes on a attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think\nAbout ... well before the scientist made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and this whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese right I mean we hear a lot of in you know therapy how effective are these new therapies that if one really wants to know why it\nWent and that's an evolving issue it in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies of failed\nAnd some people had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of the ...\nI'm Steve Inskeep

health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these\nAre a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation\nFor ... the other products of them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage\nMore than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible is met\nSome people have something called health insurance [noise] um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say ensure\nPeople may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one

been floating over the NAFTA which is the fundamental trade agreement for the U.S Canada and Mexico a sin floating over that agreement for the last two years\nAnd based upon early reports of what's

crunched the numbers and they're troubling\nEarning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available\nInteractive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nFounded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen shed he and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents if you knew anything about Charlotte\nCharlotte wants to be number one a feely a garment brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader\nI've been a physician for a lot of years worked with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city were low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have up here right now it's just kind of share a map of median income\nIn Charlotte said a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets where a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility\nIf it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for this is\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is that\nThe fathers for the Carolinas brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric heartfelt says the schools students are mostly black\nWe have forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent or\nThe larger minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar to snap here the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut when in the coming years to change it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to make it really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allow you to look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which
