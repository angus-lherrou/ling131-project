your questions to commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your inquiries each week about how politics and government work either Cokie Hi Steve certainly a big question now this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole ... sketch from Nashville, Tennessee in the U.S Saudi Arabia special relationship really based primarily on an oil arms arrangement or there's something more to it\nWas not oil for arms is oil and arms of recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices\nBut it's also purchasers President Trump has repeatedly said of arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is saying Saudi Arabia is a check on Iran both in the region internationally and\nTo the extent that it's alive issues us also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Sean ... I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S view Saudi Arabia before oil was affecting thank you\nThere was no view before or oil was a thing a Saudi Arabia as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year and signed an agreement with standard oil California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be the leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S was Abdulazeez evens out he had forty five sons Steve and all the kings\nBut lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether the U.S being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nHi this is Alex south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence does the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert\nThat the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen\nWhere the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis\nThat they're ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill

Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang saying index in Hong Kong flipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January and its currency has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob you more into our what thirty percent drop for China stock markets sounds pretty darned bad what's going on [noise]\nTry this kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this ... making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn\nOr it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\n... years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nJohn is doing a child doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the

Cleveland Orchestra is world renowned and so are these two men tell me about William ... and ... and their roles in the orchestra\nSo Lowe's has been with the orchestra for about a decade a little over a decade is the principal trombone and William ... has been the concert master since Nineteen Ninety five you know in concert master is\nBasically the second in command at the orchestra after the conductor or I spoke to some musicians who who know about his\nUh playing and he's revered for his talent it's almost like the analogy would be the Cleveland Cavaliers had abroad and the Cleveland Orchestra had William ...\nSo what did investigators find this was an independent investigation what prompted their firings\nSo they initiated this investigation a couple of months ago and they found that both men engaged in quote numerous instances of sexual misconduct with multiple female students or colleagues while they were\nMusicians while he was there a and these instances they took place between Nineteen Ninety six and two thousand seven they said the youngest victim that they uh spoke with was Seventeen at the time\nI'm only admits to three of these instances he denies the others but um and and while the investigators didn't go into a very fine detail about what happened they sort of gave an overview of a pattern of conduct they said that\nCrucial would lure women into situations where they were one on one promising private lessons and what happened ranged from sort of him forcing himself on their on them too I'm asking for sexual favors or exposing himself um\nAnd uh there were similar accusations involving Rosa um the accusations that the investigators found took place between two thousand ten and two thousand twelve and in his case he had his own sort of pattern of behavior what he\nOr what um the people who were interviewed told investigators was that\nHe would often hold private lessons and then have students engage in what he was calling breathing exercises and he would have students lie on the floor female students\nUm and he would use this as an excuse to touch the students on or above their clothes sometimes he would try to remove their clothing will remove some of his clothing\nAnd I'm In both of these cases investigators found that low Rosa and proof so basically used their power their positions of influence with in the classical music community to lure these women into these situations and then afterwards to try to keep them silent\nUm some who complained about ... behavior said that they had worried that afterwards maybe their careers had suffered investigators couldn't find any concrete evidence of that backlash but uh\nNo did the report detail that or did your reporting find anything out about that\nSo the report looks into what the management knew at the time and what later managers knew and they said that nobody in the management had full knowledge of specific incidences for press meant\nBut looking back there was plenty of information that was floating out there that they said should have prompted them to investigate meaning what\nWill meaning that there were accusations floating all floating around and even in print\nOr in ... case there was a scene article Cleveland Scene article in two thousand seven detailing accusations involving a student at the Cleveland Institute of music where he taught 'em and that prompted members of the orchestra to bring concerns to orchestra management\nUm in case there was an article and two dozen Thirteen by Inside Higher ed\nI'm detailing a an is an assault on a student now that he admits that happened at the University of Iowa and so these things were out there um and the investigator said Moore should have been done by the management to look into this\nAnd of course this investigation prompted in the first place by a report by the Washington Post in July detailing allegations against William proof Sal and later a once that investigation was launched they

S. much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWell what's interesting here Noel is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like this the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a communist I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact\nAre making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid the street or half and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out text\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back the carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain that technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching\nBut at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nAgriculture\nPart of its oil so frustration power\nSometime in ... chain coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about ...

been the concert master since Nineteen Ninety five you know in concert master is basically the second in command at the orchestra after the conductor\nI spoke to some musicians who knows playing and they say in the classical music community is revered for his talent one analogy might be that the Cleveland Cavaliers had LeBron and the Cleveland Orchestra had crucial\nSo what did investigators find this was an independent investigation what prompted their firings\nThey found that both men engaged in quote numerous instances of sexual misconduct with multiple female students or colleagues while they were employed at the orchestra for proof so they said that he engage in sexual misconduct with at least twelve female musicians while he was there\nA and these instances they took place between Nineteen Ninety six and two thousand seven they said the youngest victim that they spoke with was Seventeen at the time to push the only admits to three of these instances he denies the others and while the investigators didn't go into\nAnd then into situations where they were one on one promising private lessons and what happened ranged from him forcing himself on them too I'm asking for sexual favors or exposing himself\nAnd there were similar accusations involving Rosa the accusations that the investigators found took place between two thousand ten and two dozen twelve\nAnd in his case the people who were interviewed told investigators that he would often hold private lessons and then have students engage in what he was calling breathing exercises and he would have students lie on the floor female students\nAnd he would use this as an excuse to touch the students on or about their clothes sometimes he would try to remove their clothing remove some of his clothing\nAnd in both of these cases investigators found that low Rosa and crucial basically used their power their positions of influence with in the classical music community to lure these women into these situations and then afterwards to try to keep them silent\nUm some who complained about ... behavior said that they had worried that afterwards maybe their careers had suffered investigators couldn't find any concrete evidence of that backlash but uh the women clearly worried that it has affected their careers\nWhat did the orchestras management now so the report said that nobody in the management
