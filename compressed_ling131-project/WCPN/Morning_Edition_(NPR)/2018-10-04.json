were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a cart remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on educated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they were very very big you know there were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them um were engaged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly\nThe laws and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents so they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the

the Democratic side\nBut now this election is not about Donald Trump and has reached the election at least at the moment is about Brett Kavanaugh who's been dominating the national conversation and the and the campaign debates for the last two weeks\nAnd Republicans universally believe that he is an incredibly well qualified nominee deserves to be confirmed and it's just disgusted at the way I'm a crafts and some and the media has treated them\nOn what we should say there's a new poll out this morning and NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll that shows that are before the Kavanaugh hearings there was

a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nFor Steve rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kind of bustling in a way\nBut what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps\nAnd more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the air strikes and ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually what\nAround a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much time You're welcome Steve [noise]\nI'm David Greene and I'm

cloture on judge Kavanaugh's nomination this evening so the process can move forward\nI Want to bring in NPR's Ryan Lucas who has been following this story morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kavanaugh right amid remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it well\nThe answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on that Christine Blasey Ford's allegations\nA and the second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct or that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's uh her story is that a cabinet exposed himself to her at a party when they're both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off to do so\nOr Democrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the alleged incidents but the key thing to remember here is that uh the White House is the one in control of the background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House\nThe president controls the parameters and the president has said while he's fine if the FBI talks to anybody out there that he was providing direction to the FBI based off of what Senate Republicans wanted\nOkay well then I mean given all of that do we know what the scope was like who the F we actually spoke to

William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of busy a crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was a remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was at um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs

of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ...
