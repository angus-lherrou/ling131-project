Martin and I'm Noel King good morning the billionaire George Soros says one of several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be pipe bombs this week cirrhosis of hedge fund investor and philanthropist whose donated to causes many of them progressive around the world\nAnd we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDoors SARS has a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs or Mrs surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was are to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important moment politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen thirty to well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary\nA sort of his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived\nBy separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the circumstances for them to be in his politics and their life and he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance and moved to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge funds in New York\nSo does that that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties a specialty was a currency peg than looked\nUnsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and when forest is right\nOr the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and and the u._k. economy a descended into some chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt began in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his finance or had a clear\nPolitical confidence which was to build for less than so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but the switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand for\nQuite a much money he was spending on demographic get out the vote causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans are and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the media and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because it's sort of saw us and his allies have put them up to as to\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding in ... just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding Russian neighbors actually his philosophy is called the open society Institute He's very open about it he publishes figures are about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape the suspicion that the critics who say he is\nKnow is a portrayed as the ... from ... and so forth I think it's a pretty good indication of that tradition\nWell what do people in his native hungry think of Soros [noise] he was a hero or early on in the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti immigration populist nationalism taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much so I think\nPresident Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris is

is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David a Clinton a professor of political science at ... college says the Trump rally is a sign that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming from is this law and the Bush still see the races ... it would have been feasible to doctors go for a Republican president me becoming unprovoked district\nNick Clinton said that because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nTo the political farms and you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic signs\nHere in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray Gaspar ... says the areas about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrats\nAnd when he sees his party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\nWe have a hundred ... and ... or ... rule which for him to go much more Republican\nCounty Republican chairman ... says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party\nTo the Republican Party just because there is a lot of dissatisfaction with what has been going on at the national level\nTrump

I'm Noel King good morning the billionaire George Soros is one of several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be tightened bombs this week cirrhosis of hedge fund investor and philanthropist whose donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and\nWe should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial support\nRight Sebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs or just surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was out to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wants to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen fifty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary\nOr so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived by separating from his family\nAnd I think that trauma explains a lot about the focus of his finance or in his politics and their life and he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful\nStock market trade and so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nTell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\nWell I'm In the nineties just specialty whereas a currency pegs that looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nAnd when the person's right or the ...\nInvolved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his ... he had a\nClear political confidence which was to build for less than that he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but the switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on demographic get out the vote causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you were being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because it's sort of star us and his allies have put them up to her as to\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to says he just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding Russian neighbors actually his philosophy is called the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a figure about where that donations go so I think it's hard to escape the suspicion that the critics who say he shot every\nI'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where Jewish financed as a portrayed\nAs the shot him if it goes to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly good indication of that tradition\nWell what the people in his native hungry thinkers Soros\nHe was a hero or early on and the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that is taking over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at

countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrats in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nTo the political farms with him and you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic sons are on one for each other alive and you're moving to another county more rural county and all of a sudden it's strong country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line
