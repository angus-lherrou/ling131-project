there to one put on the table\nWell ... says the evidence that they have so far I strongly suggest that this was a planned operation basically dismissing the Saudis story that it was an accident\nAt one new thing that he said uh is that part of the evidence that they have is that the Saudis team that showed up in advance of the killing scouting out some areas possibly for disposal of a body including us\nWow the Eighteen people they've arrested in connection with the show ... death to be prosecuted in Turkey and they have all gone back to Riyadh Saudi Arabia so they would have to be

another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election and the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTwo droid gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats\nAnd that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focused building up their bench\nNot only do criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal

but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage there lectures for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence in drawing and election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder notes that Republicans\nYou're twenty what is the problem that you're trying to address what\nWe're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nHow are you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their badge\nI don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen\nThe governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and we will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team will be at the table and\nAnd obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat\nArgue campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what you were ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama when\nThey go low [noise] they go low\nWe can what did you mean\nOr what I meant ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that\nNo there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful is that something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate [noise]\nWell I certainly think some votes through protests um I I Would say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out today after the Trump ... who's very powerful when young people marched here in Washington to ask for more saying ... gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think in which the people\nShould or should express themselves attorney general holder thanks so much and I think you [noise]\n\nAll right Steve the mega millions lottery is up to one point six billion dollar billion billion with a B they're

in a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you
