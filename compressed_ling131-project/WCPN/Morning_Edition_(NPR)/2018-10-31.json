Martin to morning we are just days away from the mid term election and President Trump has laid his bets on immigration as the issue that will drive Republicans to the polls\nOr at least his hardcore supporters late last week the administration reportedly floated the idea of an executive order that would bar all migrants including those seeking asylum from entering the United states at the southern border then came the announcement on Monday the Pentagon is deploying more than five thousand troops to the border and then yesterday\nCame the idea of scrapping a key piece of the fourteenth amendment what's known as birthright citizenship through an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits she ... she was just and it has to end\nA couple of false statements their most notably the United states is one of more than thirty notions with birthright citizenship\nAlso worth noting overturning a constitutional amendment is really really difficult ... is an NPR White House correspondent and co host of the politics podcast and joins us now give money to him the mornings so is the president's anti immigrant message something that resonates with Republicans writ large or is this about really what Steve said his personal base of support\nIt it is the number one issue for Republicans the Kaiser Family foundation a has a poll out that that finds that if you ask Republican voters their top issue ... twenty five percent of them which is the highest of any other issue will say immigration is their number one issue\nIt's not nearly as salient with Democrats or with independents said this is about Republicans and this is in particular about Trump Republicans this is an issue\nFor two candidates he supports he felt it really worked for him or in the Republican primary in twenty sixteen\nAnd I guess we should just note the way the politics and the media work you can say something wildly impractical completely irrelevant not that important caravan caravan birthright citizenship and even if it's not very practical it focuses attention focuses the mind on the issue that the president wants people to be thinking\nRight and the un and what he perceived to be a threat and positioning himself as the person who can meet that threat\nYeah and you can float a lot of trial balloons and then not bring it up again after the election or have all of these troops go to the border just in time for the midterm\nFive dentist

election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I Do too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my aunts my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics or we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talking it was generally about you know politics social issues\nDemocratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise] as you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there is another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more because I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I had an and [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I Believe Dr Ford and\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it\nWith you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered [noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite\nTrump's correct and because it's more than that it's\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of that democratic checked boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican in the coming election [noise] have you talked to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I has been avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nAlexa grooming thank you so much for talking with us I

is the author of who can you trust\nShe says a lack of trust in people and businesses have held China's economy back so in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them\nAnd you know who has lots of data on how people behave companies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country\nAnd has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit\nSo the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nThe way people that school is not seem to do and they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy nineties your responsible so your school go out but if you buy video games you lazy CEO school go down\nBut the central credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data its own and that data will factor into people's social credit scores to\nThe social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until

synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his Davis of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her story of at the University of Maryland shows the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys ...\nActually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to a person gets paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump has personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest for [noise] you know what do they talk about they don't get mad at the the lead you ever see the elite\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and\nHe has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know so then what's the connection he wants\nTo win any as a special talent of knowing how to appeal\nThen it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a

costumes we want to be where they are you know what it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nDickey says in the past that they've opened as many as eat pop shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more experts\nThat

know they're fun they're positive they're engaging the track families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... to regret and we walked in the past ... and we've seen a lot of celebrities you

in which anti Semitism can take root\nThe control of the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no

that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth
