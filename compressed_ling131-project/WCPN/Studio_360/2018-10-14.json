welcome to studio three sixty thank you so this play is about the great actress of the second half of the nineteenth century in the early twentieth century uh serve Bernhardt\nPlayed by the remarkable incandescent Jennings here and the central stories about her insistence at the height of her career Eighteen Ninety seven\nYes that she wanted to play hamlet yes as a middle aged woman on the stage and everybody is skeptical of that idea\nA end she wants to play rewritten to strip out the poetry and let me I Am certainly as the law but bottom I Am and make it more like talk yeah and uh and focus more on I guess the action yes she was somebody who is\nReally known to be a sort of electrifying active presence on stage\nAnd she wanted to play hamlet that way\nAnd she felt like the classical dancer the poetry stood in a way out of the action which in fact it does you think so I just spent\nA year working on it makes its argument but I wasn't sure watching the play that you bought her argument because as she says it it gets last like what how dare you want to adapt Shakespeare in that way\nI sort of stand with Sarah and a lot of her arguments she's quite a brilliant woman and a lot of the things that she argues in the play I did sort of lift from her own writings\nUm so you have written a according to my research uh twenty five ... players I've actually written thirty eight thirty I yeah\nI but it it's strange Carol ... announced in a lifetime\nShakespeare were thirty seven to catch 'em but that's one of the year basically for your you know ... plus doesn't dozens of episodes for like twenty TV shows a couple of what you've created\nMore prolific so why is that [noise]\nWell you know I don't know I Am very fascinated by writing a I mean truly fascinated by it\nIn ways that not everyone is do you like doing it I Do like that's the\nThat's actually the other Hugo I Do like it I like you know yeah Dorothy Parker said famously I hate writing but I Love having written which is correct view I Love writing wow and I kind of earth for I Am a freak I the other thing that happens to me\nIs you know I think that a lot of writers are\nThis neurosis around finishing things I don't know what that is because I don't have it for you know and I do actually closer I spent an hour in her talking to him about that very subject the terror of finishing can't\nOkay I have the opposite thing I have the terror of the unfinished and so once I get to a certain place in the script my anxiety goes really high until I write the end and one of the things that I Do teach my students want to teach I don't do a lot\nBut is that you know you really don't have anything until you've got a full draft and then you can start talking and that's not to say you should rush through your first draft but I Do feel like you know what are you talking about what are you doing and you can't actually even begin to answer that question until you make it all the way through it a first draft\nAnd it was highly um expressionist African gesture all a there was a kind of depletion of psychology and language which is what people know when they look back or if they find these tax they think\nYou know it doesn't have a natural anticipated movies was trying to be a movie or and they were they were it was silent movies are silent existed and also I think you can actually draw the line straight from Victorian melodrama into silent movie and into German Expressionism and there's a kind of ethics sized do a lot of the\nStories that I I find really powerful and and it's very stories centric yes yes and you're working for a story or do you do feel like oh I have a kid\n... you know I think there's a kind of contemporary\nRight now move away from it which is there's no question I'm not interested in ... and ... them or fractional for our post modernist and what's going on here and I I don't find that satisfying sometimes I mean I go to see it and I think well okay\nUm I certainly am a big fan of back at you know the musicality and that deep heart\nAre are things that I respond to a so it's not like I Need a big story to be satisfied in the theater um but uh I Do believe that the action rises out of character and story rises out of action and that those are profound truth\nI'm In that great plays a written on those truth or and or don't apologize right I'll go to my deathbed a insisting\nBut there are people who actually criticize your work for being too accessible well I find that mystifying do I do or is it just a general standard issue snobbish this of the twentieth century and now twenty first century well I think that it's\nA it sounds arrogant toward the audience we named which seems contradictory around a form that can survive without an audience and I so I've always felt like I Do want to invite people in a to the theater I deeply believe we should all be going to the theater\n[noise] a series of ... it has been a pleasure
