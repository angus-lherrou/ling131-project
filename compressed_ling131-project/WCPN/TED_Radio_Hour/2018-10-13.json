video it's that\nTed radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj I Want to start the at the beginning of your career in the Nineteen eighties you I guess you you started out as a as a public defender right\nI did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school\nAnd what was what was the idea behind that you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise] that's right\nAnd I like lots of people had no idea what was going on now criminal legal system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense connected and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes for justice [noise]\nUm and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true well\nWhich you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime how police\nClass in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could but definitely you were pushing up\nAgainst an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients but their families and they're retired communities [noise]\nHere's more from Robin Steinberg on the ...\nI'm ... so fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery is a massive ... it always has that we all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night and America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of an effect these mothers and\nAnd sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nPrice is called male\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own discretion\nI have seen it as low as a hundred dollars for the people that we representing the clients that we see bell is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system [noise] so\nSure if you can't post bail you're you're stuck in a jail that's correct once said if you can't pay your balance you are going to have to wait until one or two things happens you're either going to plead guilty to go home\nThe other possibility is that you demand you're hearing or trial and that weight can be anything from weeks to months two years and that is not an exaggeration there are people waiting in local jails across this country who had been sitting there for years waiting to get their day in court\nStaples and from Americans for the ...\nThe Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj\nAnd on the show today ideas about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise\nTo [noise] like to have you look at the pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise]\nIt's her books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing\nI can do whatever I Want to my book or my car these great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James model of a sudden he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes\nThey're legal things [noise]\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nBut well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being it at the time of slavery but person isn't entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights you know one time\nAnd we're persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now no all human beings are considered to be persons\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal person speaking it's more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how that works so\nA person and thing are both terms of art\nAnd and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are\nSo for example in the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights in national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia\nIs a person who has real legal rights\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals that's a cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defense list and I never realized how voiceless in defense was that billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I just\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ... ... ... changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream that\nWas my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success them so much have to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal\nHistory was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and after he got there\nDecided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because when they ... century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escaped and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James ...\nThe Kansas City of London signed him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law written the heaviest corpus on behalf of Jim Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSummer said was a legal thing he was not eligible for I read of habeas corpus only if he could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain to shift their a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of James Harrison\nStarted to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James how much time we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that\nWith chimpanzees is because of all the\nHundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention to court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed\nHundred and sixty pages of half a day that we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you wanted to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of New York and where were they being held captive\nWell Hercules in Leo were being held captive at Stony Brook university at the age of two professors had taken them from their mothers and\nWe're keeping them in a cage in the basement of the computer building and they they were being used in experiments to determine why humans walk with a straight leg and chimpanzees walk with it that way but that required that they undergo general anesthesia that they have wires thrust into their muscles anyway\nHer house in central New York in a small town on the use trailer lot and then Kiko was being held in cement storefront on a residential street in Niagara Falls\nIt's that had radio hour from NPR\nI'm Guy Raz and on the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of a elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand lettuce to random section of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the countries and making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and\nTo me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some pilot population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John out of some people I'm not I'm Sorry a contract has got to the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams ducked with settlers and it's just I just got my diagnosis Adam saying\nAre the people who want political power as specifically that people who should not have political power um by randomly\nYou pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably\nWant to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nAnd in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a\nParliament in the world to instigate a\nOne they like the chamber in one swoop titian chamber once will titian buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people look at the audition chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians basically back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament tried to society of friends I think we should populated our parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least it's obviously yes [noise]\nLifetime [noise] yeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens\nAssemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe it'll spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try to convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try that\nYes ah yeah it ... it I'm not going to be easy a political changes have easy\nUh especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate tried something new I think half systems birth to\nAn unknown to see a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find is full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is ... he's a legal advocate\nThis last year getting ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says\nWhat do we owe one another where do we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules and institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between faction norms but that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge gap oftentimes people who need those rules are the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nFeedback began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law back to the people\nHere seem like Mario on the head stage\n[noise] I Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none the rubbish from a community of hurts people included up on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lift\nThen Twenty years later the same company to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia is got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company had violated many of them dust from that factory covers about these mustache and everything he wears Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village\nHe said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing none to decided to use the last means of protest he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory where the fuck it a petrol and his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra Leone in Cambodia in Ethiopia farmers are being cajoled into putting their stumped prints on fifty years lease agreements sending away all the land they've ever known for a paper without anybody even explaining the terms\nRight now in the United states in India in Slovenia\nPeople like Rob the are raising their children in the shadow of factories are mines that of poisoning their air and their water\nDuring environmental laws that would protect these people\nBut many have never seen those laws let alone having a shot at enforcing them\nIn the world seems to have decided that's okay\nSo how does this happen I mean I I Know it's sort of a naive question but\nHow is it that in most of the world there are laws on paper looks great but ... but if you look closer you would see that that's actually not the case yeah why is that I mean part of it is that uh it's just", "year":
