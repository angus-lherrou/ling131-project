I'm not inspirational [noise]\nI don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me because at some point in your life you have dreamt of being disabled\nCome on and joined in with me it's Christmas Eve here\nAt the mall you're driving around in circles looking for parking and what do you see the teen empty handicap safe [noise] and you're like God can I just feel little disabled [noise]\n\nAlso I got to tell you I got Ninety nine problems and hold Li is just one [noise] if if there was on oppression Olympics\nI Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and you saw it live young the so called so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like\nKind of uncomfortable right because you you were talking about how you shake like Shaquille and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire you know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially\nI Do naturally because men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think\nI think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so\nBecause I mean disability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television that disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe and can't my father's ... you can do it yet you can get [laughter]\n\nIf my three older sisters were ... I was not been as my three older sisters went to public school my parents went to the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking I Know they tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me [laughter] [laughter] my inner river was very strong and\n[laughter]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a chance to I'd been on one too many times [noise]\n\nSo when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was three on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back\nTo New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I say I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm hysterical [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or their challenges through humor right and\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own\nStarted post nine eleven in New York City my friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happen to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just wanted to talk about beyond say\nI'm I named my cat beyond and people are like talking about guys are talking about several probably talked about\nYou know I'm like but I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now that I Do battle because having grown up\nWith you know one foot in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did the dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in\nFront of every one I really thought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing [noise]\nGrowing up there were only six Arabs in my town and they were all my family now there are twenty hours in town and they are still my family [noise] I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian [laughter]\n[noise] this\nWas before nine eleven and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use I hate moslems as the campaign slogan let people know I grew up with had no problem with my face and they did however seem very concerned that I Would start to death during Ramadan I Would explain to them now I have enough fat\nMy son was in a war zone because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer we'd grow up to be Madonna [noise]\n[noise] and from the John D and Catherine the MacArthur Foundation that max found dot org\nIt's a tad radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and on the show tapes painfully funny ideas about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian again for sun and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they were trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and again took with the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming and not too long after he came up something happened back in New York police were and again the usually felt welcomed and accepted\nHate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better font but\nAh why not macho own poster campaign right that does nice things about Muslims so myself\nAnd she ate for over five months got approved an end to\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to ban the poster citing political content once they got a couple of those posters here one after that Muslims can do push-ups Muslims\n[noise] let's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe\nUs are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign and try to fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying as a couple of dirt comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nTalk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful yeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we'd like set up a table called me about religion we're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was old sesame\nReady and the rules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which totally look stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of ...\nHer on it is the\nPeople guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was a violent um came from the current Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no men has touched me\nTo do we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stuff done them so why would we hold Islam to separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you know a lot of difference between the three of them ... you\nKnow [noise] it's incredible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing ... performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nPerson to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then\nI was a popular and shifting perception [noise] and that is social change but at the time and it takes eight\nMillion jobs deems chuckle [noise]\nComedian against our side she's the author of how to make white people\nLaugh and she also hosts a podcast called the nation you can find her full talk at ... dot com [noise]\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can cope with things that on their face\nAre very funny as this is this is you believe\nThis is Kevin real has ... the writer and they stand up comedian\nOr like every other Thursday that aren't taken [noise]\nSo does he says we made sense but then she got his life is she's ready for him though [noise]\nOut event was marvelous [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny is also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a\nAs a young person when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas of thoughts\nOn stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative West End up for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best\nThat really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly been a long way I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of you know shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin briel tells his story on the stage and you can already tell this story is gonna sound pretty different from the other ones you heard on the show\nFor a long time my life [noise] I felt like I've been living two different lives\nThere is a life that everyone sees\nAnd then there's life that only I see [noise] and then the life that everyone sees who I Am as a friend a son and brother [noise] stand up comedian and a teenager\nIn life that only I see\nWho I
