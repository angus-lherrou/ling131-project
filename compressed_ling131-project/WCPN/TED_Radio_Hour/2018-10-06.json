thing to be inspired be original and to be yourself at visit main dot com\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise so imagine a big thick book\nAbout the size of a dictionary and inside that book each and every page filled with just four letters just four letters printed over and over\nA G C and teams right before let us to be going to be an a\nFour letter that the ... species McClellan has is made up of four letters each representing a chemical compound arranged in just such a way to make you view\nThis is really where the information comes from is not the four letters but exactly how they're connected to each other so it's a ... seat cheating or\nA a Jew or a CD or a this by the way is Sam Steinberg I studied gene editing technologies and Sam says if you print it out all of the\nAsian jeeze and sees and tease it takes to\nComplete your entire genetic code which by the way is a lot of letters the genome is three point two or so billion letters you know you would have hit a lot of pages or if you had every pitch filled with these Gees\nSo could you say that every single out uh our our our physical traits the color of our eyes are characteristics are personality traits come from for chemical\nI Would say wow and the centrally all the information to turn a single fertilized eggs so into an adult human is contained within that singular Geno\n... now here's what's really crazy sixty years ago we didn't even know what the you know was the answer to the question what his life was in history\nAnd that of course the question I Want to know you know direct to explain the life after it got started ... what was the essence of life\nWhat was the essence of life that was the question answered by James watcher who spoke about it on the stage and the and watch and along with his partner Francis Crick discovered the essence of who we are\nWe got the answer I'm twenty eighth of a February fifteenth race and that was one Watson and Crick discovered the hidden language of DNA you know if you just put a next to\nKey and Jean next to see you have a ...\nSo we saw how\nGenetic information to carry this order for re election and\nCrick discovery helped us eventually to figure out how those four letters added up to eight hundred dictionaries for one human\nWhich led to another huge milestone on the journey to understanding who we are earlier today at the White House President Clinton announced the completion of the mapping the human genome this was in June of two thousand\nMore than a thousand searches across six nations have revealed nearly all three billion letters of our miraculous genetic code I congratulate all of you on the stunning and humbling for cheap\nAnd if the mapping of the human genome we now have our greatest\nWas this profound new knowledge humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal [noise]\nGenomes science will have a real impact on all our lives\nAnd so now years on the next big thing is almost here\nBack then we you know if the government spent three billion dollars to get that\nFirst genome sequenced and now we're talking about companies that are offering you complete genome for just a thousand dollars wow and so I think we're going to continue to your knowledge relating goes for letters back to various traits increase in the coming years\nIt's the\nTed radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show today ideas about who we are what makes us us and we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine\nCould make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like superheroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the yeah the I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leaner muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart\nDisease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory you\nAllow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to pain or or give us a hierarchy use you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside so what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits still inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders\nSweeping given that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of\nAnd yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with\nHigher IQ or being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think of all power to control an illusion you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n[noise]\nToday show or asking a very important question is\nOkay what do you have the answer dino who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I I have a a a an inkling of who we are the hair Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind in human nature\nAh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian who they are taking you gossip man has no instincts from the anthropologist asked we want to do the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J goals ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial for most is that if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero but if something is written on the slate and some people could have more\nFor fear of human nature is that if we were blank slate we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts and perhaps some of them can damage to selflessness prejudice and violence first of all\nThere are a number of reasons to go for the human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament mentality doesn't all come from the outside oh and anyone who uh\nHas both a child and a house that has certainly noticed that the child exposed to speech full acquire a human language whereas the house pet flown presumably because of some innate difference between them than anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationships knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not just English of all [noise]\nSo for years the debate about nature versus nurture has been just\nA debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nIt's a mistake to think that uh if there is some effect of the environment that shows that were blacks whites or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are a robots and we're programmed to a or walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment [noise]\nJust the wrong way to think about it\nThe right way to think about it he says he starts with our genome\nThe the fact that we behave like humans are not like a orangutans are chimpanzees or a squirrels is a very much determined by our our Gino so or do you know\nShows up pretty strong statistical effect of our genes but then here's where environment comes in aside from the fact that we ... we have a unique\nAnd I'm sure today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd according to a humorist they Frank in this short talk it's not that complicated areas on the stage [noise] this is the human test a desk to see if you are human\nBeings raise your hand if something applies to you or we agreed [noise] yes [noise] been let's begin [noise] have you ever eaten the Bulger long past your childhood [noise]\nIt's okay it's safe here [noise]\nHave you ever made a small weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing [noise]\nHave you ever purposely lower case the first letter of the text in order to come across as sad or disappointed [noise]\nHave you ever ended attacks with a period as a sign of aggression [noise]\nOkay [noise]\nHave you ever laughter smiled when someone said\nSomething ... to you and then spent the rest of the day wondering why you'll reacted that way [noise]\nHave you ever seem to lose your airplane ticket a thousand times as you walk from the check in to the gates [noise]\nTheir [noise] have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized that there was a loose socks most up against us high\n[noise]\nHave you ever tried to get someone else's passwords so many times that it lock their accounts\nYes it's safe here [noise]\nHave you ever hope that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet that you are just naturally great cast\nHave you ever have broken something in real life and then found yourself looking for an undue button in real life [noise]\nHave you ever marveled\nAt how someone you thought was so ordinary could suddenly becomes so beautiful [noise]\nHave you ever stared at your phone's smiling like an idiot while texting with someone [noise]\nHave you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase I'm staring at the phone smiling like an idiot [noise] have you ever been tempted to and then gave in to the temptation looking through\nSomeone else's phone [noise]\nHave you ever had a conversation with yourself and then suddenly realized your real [noise] see ourselves [noise]\nHas your phone never run out of the battery in the middle of an argument and it sort of sounds like the phone was breaking up with both of you [noise]\nHave you ever thought that working on an issue between you was futile because it should just be easier than this or this is supposed to happen just naturally\nHave you ever realized that very little in the long run just happens naturally [noise]\nHave you ever woken up\nBlissfully and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you [noise]\nHave you ever lost the ability to imagine a future without a person that no longer was in your life [noise]\nHave you ever look bad\n[noise] congratulations you've now completed the terrorist you are all human [noise]\n\nIs writer and humorist they Frank [noise] got a couple of other great talks at ... dot com on the show today what makes us\nUs [noise] can you explain what it means to be conscious like what is it [noise] consciousness is\nThe most familiar thing for any of us I mean we all know the difference between being conscious and not being conscious\nThis is an al ... he's a professor of neuroscience at the University of sex in the u._k.\nConsciousness as any kind of experience at all whether it's a visual experience of the world around us whether it's an emotional\nExperience of feeling sad or jealousy or happy or excited or from my experiences of intending to do something or of being the cause is something that happens consciousness is the word that we use to sex subscribe\nAll the different kinds of experiences that that we can have [noise]\nI think that pretty much sympathy for conscious system there is something it is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious [noise] there is [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing we exist\n[noise] and also explains more from the pet stage [noise]\nWatching this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all areas without that was my world does myself\nAnd when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or pen\nAnd if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals might they be conscious too\nWhen my iPhone develops a sense of its ... existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I pretty much\nIn the store I'm going to tell you all conscious experiences of the world around us and about sounds within it all kinds of controlled for these nations that happened with fruit and because of all live in ... [noise]\nI Love this idea of a controlled police nation is is that is that what we experience is that how we experience the world that it's\nIt's a control to loose nation we are just essentially hallucinating all the time [noise]\nI Love the strike zone I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because\nIt points out that everything that we could see consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now is a construction of the bright I mean\nIt's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us through the windows of our eyes scanned what conscious perception is is basically just somebody's sitting inside us go looking out there and they see a red ... they passed in\n... game there's better writers ahead\nReal reality [noise]\n\nThat's right but the truth is that both perceptions are acts of interpretation that act of informed guesswork that the brain applies when encounters sensory data I think the ... the way I Can't think of is is that there is no line in the skull and this may sound that\nOil is going on in the brain or electrical impulses whizzing around and complex passing an out of all the oldest passing much in the in the brain ... appears [noise]\nIn some sense we we've known this for a long time since ...\nOf objects in the world they are attributes of of reflected light and and the brain the visual system will make inferences based on wavelengths of light about what color or something it's\nA ... something as basic as color is not something that we just passively receive from the world we actively attribute it to things out there on the world\nAnd the idea of control to the nation is is just that will just applies to everything and this applies to everything that we perceive\nAnd not just perceptions of things out there in the world but who said applies to our perceptions about south of a buddy of our memories of a sense of agency about sensitive volition that every\nThing that we see is a construction but it's it's not a random construction its construction that's a best guess that is reined in by the sensory detrimental times which is why most of us agree when we look at a table that we will say yeah I see it's like well you see a title we both see the same thing\nAnd that's because he got just random constructions that constrained by the sensory data that we get and that's why I think the control of the nation is very appropriate\nHis one more example which shows just how quickly the brain can use new productions to change what we consciously experienced listen to this [noise]\n\nSounded strange right have a listen again and see if you can get anything [noise]\n\nStill strength not listen to this I think ...
