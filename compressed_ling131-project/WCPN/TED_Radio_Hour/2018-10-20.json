like a bell pepper growing and just pick it up and start eating if nobody's going to say hey what are you doing that's my bell pepper no of course they're not\nNo they're not but the really interesting thing is it's it's it it helps throw back some attitudes about individuals' behavior because as I say we've got the ... the railway station and all over the place\nAnd we've got big signs that say ... to ... wow if you want to pick rocky 'til you want to come out and do you want to pick a pepper or whatever is that it used to pick on the truth is nobody takes everything they pick you know and that's it [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nMartin has been like this for a decade or so ever since ... started a movement there to bring the community together around food and that is however movement incredible edible was born the idea for it came to her on a train ride one afternoon when she was coming back from an environmental conference\nHad no intentions of doing anything different on the day I just sat in the audience and listened\nAnd it just suddenly struck me why I just go home and start to do things differently I got an a train and I just made up incredible edible [laughter] and it was a really simple model really simple um it was just like see my gym wherever we live in a ... a neighborhood our town a village whatever works at any scale\nWe punted edible landscapes everywhere that we could you just collect empty lots and just start planting stuff that you leave once you plant food Frank um and then we've got picked up that show people was gross\nAnd you're you're going to just see fruits and vegetables growing everywhere yeah you absolutely are but you know this isn't I often say this is the ... you know it's not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen [noise] but we do a flipping back [noise]\nHere's a pound explained it on the stage now known as they say is rocket science it certainly is not clever and it's not original but it isn't joined ... is inclusive\nBase is not a movement for those people are going to solve themselves are to anyway they said the movement ... every well we haven't lost ... if you ate you're in [noise]\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and to on the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live I just bought a bottle of water and I'm the label is head gluten free interesting\nWell and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nThing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call Monica cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time planted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century or ... what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah\nWell Seth and ... and then the corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nWe got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe a baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed by\nThe seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself\nWill kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you're saying there are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like today we ship food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs you know this didn't go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're going to be able to get a mango if you want it to ... you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an army of or you need everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you are a food to eat like I think of my Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the B. six begin before six or\nA few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah within those rules\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals on junk food we don't need either of them for health votes have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\n\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ... dot com\nUm well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs re ... the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta what the hell line you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which shouldn't paleo kind of a housing bust is gonna kill you\nStory isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate of Seventy four percent ... act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise]\nHidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nIt says Dr Robert Lustig he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... ... did you know I mean ... that's even had some famous now apple\nPuree or evaporated Keynesian yeah my favorite because changes so you know just healthy right what happens when you evaporate changes you get [noise] sugar [noise]\nEver Lustig studies sugar how they manage to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they process food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much of it has rubber Las Vegas on the head stage\nDoes sugar cause diabetes or everyone says well yeah but it's because of the calories sure empty calories that's the ... is not this is absolutely true sugar are toxic calories so here's the way to look at the ... the prevalence of diabetes worldwide as we speak right now\nWho's worst\nSaudi Arabia Kuwait you ate a cutter\nIn Malaysia why then no alcohol\nThe soft drinks like they're going out of style\nThis is the word studies from Europe showed that if you consume one soda per day your risk for diabetes goes up twenty nine percent irrespective of the calories irrespective of your weight irrespective of anything else you wait\nTed radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raz today food why we eat what we eat and why our food is\nSometimes so much more than what we put on our plates we all think we taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the to the smoky are actually being vacated by nostrils but our brains doing is wonderful job of ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and making me believe as if it's coming from I ... this is Charles Spence a head of the ... research debauchery Oxford University what is the cost of medical research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... lab right here in the psychology department where we look at how the senses interact\nAnd gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat but said our mouse and our years\nWe'd expert ... where we're feeding people up potato chips and each time they been into a potato chip we would change the sound that they could sometimes making their own crunching ...\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch the freshness or these other attributes that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might Tyler I white wine artificially ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriate you'll find the experts the wind make says we'll get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine [laughter] all the ... the ... on the top chocolates in stone fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than [noise]\nRural convinced we can taste the food we can enjoy the flavors ... of the wind in the blast\nBut if I look at what's going on it's created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study it has the measures have a tendency among the scientists that when you're a guest on this is this thing people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain lights up this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nIs one problem here which is that in fact in the mattress up one of these brain scan is kind of lie on your back where they had climbed stale with a Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically ... sin ah some drink you call them what to do for your head all kind of a jolt and that will spoil that the brain scan alignment but it's got to tell you something to do something useful but he doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal in one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be able to make very race it ... it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as us the best meals but ... would I guess has to be that raised them the mood you're in on the people you're with so because the social aspects of dining\nUm I didn't know what is it bad that perfect meal when the fighting with that pot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with us and resonate them then you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed ... their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red line that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you\nWere thinking that phenomenon housing\nUm but to kill the guy for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nNess sitting somewhere on a on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless like basketball I said why you've ever had so great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you happen and you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah I can say well how is it something about when the bottles when the Arab play with a cold and not you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat or drink no we're always\nSomewhere in certain environments in certain states of mind\nOn a mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it I mean is there any way some myths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\nAnd put some of the pleasure into what we think about food\n[noise] in fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll bring has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting see on the walls of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that inside a in the dishes I so so that he that too much than star restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition and star restaurant\nA white table cloths\nThere's no ... on the table was no glasses or in a place where nothing it's just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables the fall\nThey don't see when you arrive tower and it makes it moving sounded and sort of some of those titled other there'll be laughing\nAnd then even guaranteed within a minute you have the whole restaurant pal of moving fires laughing Dina's and that is the moment when the first is comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even with ties of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] [noise] wow so like from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [laughter]\nUh no so we don't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with ... cultures if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question as several weeks after people are being his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced that comes remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that construction something they're going to experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of pills and the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say that is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste\nFood uh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color school days just the sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food remarried plastic cutlery known as the silver and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in a country manor house looking at it and they ...\nSo the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... through just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment and those kinda contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number\nSaying we don't need to just about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal\nYou can see his entire talked head to head that NPR outdoors\nSo let's get shifted a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what ... does okay my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a wagon and getting where it's like an Indian\nVie for ... ... it's very difficult for you to pronounce your pockets are back in you that you were out everything is in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week or so and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's ah something that we were friends is over or a rice dish over 'em in the vegetables or into salads that what do you buy like which ones are we have four species that are for say when the metal ends that is a locusts crickets meal worms and buffalo worms\nYup which for the record do not taste like
