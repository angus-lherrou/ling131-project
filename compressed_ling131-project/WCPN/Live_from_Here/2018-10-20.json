this parking garage\nBut I'm ready to go on behalf of live from here I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I traveled to Buffalo New York along Lake Erie were the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecasts was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeve shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years and our cat was filled with stuffed animals they lined the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and the monkey was attached to the steering wheel\nThese are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys\nShe goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really\nWith gender fluids I guess there was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie\nAfter growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they want it to go to the hottest place I could find but it turns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for lizards people stay there too long start to look like a sponge that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we have a lot of moisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water me and I grow when it's not raining it's snowing and when it's not doing either we can

last call his four AM they say they're staying up to open later gives the snowplows time to clear your way home [noise]\nI entered what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in lights and years of science coasters stuck to the walls to kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place that so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked he said that he's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the streets\nThere's something great about eating food that makes a city famous in addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home for so long that you started professing your love for a plate of deep fried chicken wings\nI have\nChris had a big hartfield laugh his kids are grown in just him and his wife down the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking\nI don't understand what everybody's after I mean sure moving to another city might get you a little more money but when you lose from being away from your family is too big of a cost\nEveryone complains about their parents until they shell out twenty dollars an hour for a babysitter and then suddenly we're not so bad [noise] he keeps me busy with this bowling league he said people like to knock bowling but it's a damn good game especially when you have your own shoes\nHe pointed wall bowling trophies behind him that his team in one throughout the years their name is great\nFalls a fire\nThis year we're a little nervous we lost one of our guys to a heart attack and there's a young team called the kings that's been gunning for us but we refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was ... splits\nAmong the trophies was a faded newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was the cast in the last year they won the state championship this was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day\nHave you ever started to tear up about a bartenders glory years only to realize it was just you\nOdd my lips were on fire tears were rolling down my cheeks I wasn't thinking clearly have you ever tried to act cool and in front of a bunch of locals until one of them pointed out that you were sweating from your bald spot\nI have\nI stumbled outside to get some air and the first snowflakes were starting to fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to see before they hang around too long and becomes difficult\nI looked up to the sky as a snowflake landed on my cheek and I brushed it off have you ever forgot that you would wings sauce on your fingers touched your eyes and had to run into a bar to beg a giant bartender to throw beer in your face [noise] I have\nAnd that's why I'm not a local but I'll return to buffalo just as soon as the snow melts and I buy some gloves until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nIt's supposed to come out on the road\nCity Missouri to trim and Peter on November first\nHey this is boring treaty\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]
