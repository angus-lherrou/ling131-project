America Tom are you there\nI'm here current on behalf of life from here I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans this week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York\nSweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags\nNew York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone [noise] the streets were colorful as always and Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nAs a hat [noise] I have\nI walked into Washington Square park who sat on offense near a dog run there's nothing crazier than in New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are had that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to pee on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their mind I sat next to one of the dog owners and\nMusician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket said\nHe was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco\nWith a spike the collar and an upper lip and the permanence ...\nDavid lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now is a studio\nMusician he was lamenting about how the city has changed there's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who were too strange to live in their hometowns but\nNow there's nothing left us a weirdos can afford he said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people\nFrom all around the world he said just look at this dog park right\nWho's getting a little too friendly with or knows this is New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on a normal night this area's hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous the bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets\nTo me it's the adults in costume were the scariest part of Halloween at least when a child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise]\nAnd they had it down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty humor his face painful smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confuse the grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends\nWhere I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kind of friends were looking for where they were too did they live in a magical lamb\nShould I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree [laughter] and I felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mind\nAnd walking down the street have you ever gotten looks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the summer for lovers [noise]\n\nTried to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view\nThe postal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes they created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy but when you get to that\nDesperate and dressed like a blue cartoon character\n[noise]\nHis effort was valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side frozen like a very\nKoala there [noise] I have never heard\nAlive Kuala bearing couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin runs that broke my heart [noise]\nJust as I was about to help three other ... came running up and grab [noise]\nAs long lost brothers hug them and knocked him to the ground in a pile of blue and white for I felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away\nHave you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer so stuffed animals [noise]\nThey insisted that come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train as a bank you we went to Joe is on ... street and sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window most people just fight through the crowd and take their sliced outside\nI was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these murders\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy devil a hotdog a Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\nAre off your was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weirdos hey have a happy Halloween everybody and until next time this has been Tom ...\nTheater on\nFirst Jeff Tweedy how you've been man I'm great yeah very happy to be here [noise]\nSo\nAh I wanted to ask you a question you have your new book coming out a new
