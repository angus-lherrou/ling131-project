I'm rubber crow which uses radio lab and today\nWe have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten\nYeah it it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurt somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up and what\nThey saw for the middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife\nThey did he got the other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees and he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods\nNear a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back to the first\nBoy Eighteen year old Phillip dumb blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise]\nAnd then they heard filled voice get really high and they knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing doubly ski with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... ran to his car Carol and melon Alfie ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Freeman\nLaying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up and calmly and clearly walked into the forest and thus began what was it the time\nCommenced on Monday morning many deputies and state police standing by\nThere was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower and through a roving patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID\nA thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis scale senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape\n... seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are short of our people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving round here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering\nThey left behind coolers says a manhunt dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police follower lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer may ... block spotted Guerra\nDecent freeze or got big on something of that fact and scare started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up\nWell not moving and so they thought he might be dead\nBecause he was just laying there but but you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there grilling him the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk and it's at this point\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that it's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for rubber girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole stories start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nIt was a fighter I like ... flights go forwards standing up for the gun and\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nBut then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong to take your mo you need a forty five and a or to head the field I mean this guy is dangers in love with things are going up\nThis is the year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty\nSmall things one one a schoolteacher shelters this trial he was sued the school and I talked to mother but a million head on all of them will be representing that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\n... ... for [noise]\nUm let's see some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped his court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from girls wife\nTelling me that he wanted to talk to me\nOne of our money to represent him my impression is that our money didn't want to do it\nDriving that lady friends car to try to lose and the two\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nDismissed as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren McCain street and the town supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava system a road that goes to the miners are what is clear to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very ...\nElla total walking right in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could've came around here so\nThe so here we are in our Sunday suits in every groan trudging through force looking for the [noise]\n\nSpent hours looking [noise]\nWe found this was her ... well you see the\nAsh a fair they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see here's sneak the blue shoe a blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this ... does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your\n... back up the\nEventually ... found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when delta G founder\nSo what ensued was a very long struggle where the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the ...\nSure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you\nCan't you just care we took her to know to keep your confidence who's over time under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that if we can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question or frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectors and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there is no if if if\nPeople are already dead than you do the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you\nHave a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play this part of a system in which you're the one\nWho stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer\nAnd part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right if there are ways each year building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nYeah of course yes and I knew Mr hawk from going to lose his du da da da da da da da da da da da and they knew him from church and\nWhat and if you have to be and then I'm On a few ... the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\n[noise] so now what is she [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab\nAnd now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right when they knew this thing they knew their client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move well so they decide to plead bird plea bargain\nThat take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my client\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give them a moon you're going to take a little\nThat's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information as a person he doesn't want to have to keep\nBut he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Andrew McCabe investigator from the state police detective located in the district attorney armies office and when they met army and biology search the briefcase was up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nThe whole talking about Susan in a leash or like these are the two girls that we're most concerned about we think they're alive\nAnd bell Jay said I'm not telling you anything unless we have the deal will\nBe a and the investigator thought that the lawyers were absolutely ludicrous they thought they'd lost their mind\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\n[noise] uh ... I was a good lawyer ...\nArt everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nPeople say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp I agree um his duties to his client who represented clients\nThis case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer she should be\n\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I I'm Roberta pets and I'm a mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so it's sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified\nEthical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nIn the first thing you'd heard than it was in ... when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equals a lot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call it the unease my daughter's boyfriend\nWas his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total\nAnd causing more months of horror and [laughter] and this is why did they taught law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot\nOf sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate in words I made forty years later I'm Still I still struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't know I guess\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise] what can I say she was she did receive her degree passed you mostly ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd um [noise]\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had been jets that summer and he had a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just the year before and so to live [noise] and I'm sure the other two children\n\nIt's it's a horrible you know to be in a position\nTo have to live [noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what excuses for protecting the person that killed her\nNo justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\n\nUm and then you get just a minute of silence that that's OK\n\n\nOkay can you hear the\nEchoes of dogs cannot things can get\nThen there dripping I Can't tell where it's drifting everything up here is frozen solid so sure what that is [noise]\nBut I think I'm going to turn background\nOr wish I'd put some flowers or something\n[noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab
