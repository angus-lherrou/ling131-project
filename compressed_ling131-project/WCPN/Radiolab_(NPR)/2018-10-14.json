Bach which has a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in him or thinks are pretty startling levy because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty\nOne I was taking a French literature class and one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page like\nA long stint sausage is there to fall off you know three\nSyllables per line so it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and I was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that I still not\nBy heart diplomas basically a get well card written by this guy ... who was opposed nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd then he wrote a poem for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick flu or something in this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first here okay\nIt's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak accumulated a sec young lady [noise]\nMoney none of us who doesn't look going through new ... ... ... ... to beat them all ... to\n... see onto the top boost\nI'll go on for ... to ... billion in young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many chicks and you were I was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads a poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his for [noise]\nThey become very popular the publisher decided to have it translates\nInto a number of languages including French in that process which took years it put me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nPopped into his mind and I said oh there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set ... here's the thing he says he got this problem mommy none of them doesn't look\nIf you just focus on the words is basically just the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison ... piece of I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam coffee too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your plump shape the elderly or you know it's sort of like get better here's to your good health\nDue to dwell on the boat and I mean young but just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted mass end and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA BBC CD and uh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems they've known to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per lawyer you did not yet or three syllables per line I mean that's crucial\nOn me So Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this come along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast sea onto the boost used to like this land that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead of hurting\nBlood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their can instead of squirming in your own bed of slurping sloppy and in the dead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in bed on and on\nAnd I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick band you're a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health being near my sweet dear\nSo claim laws now Douglas yeah Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the weather will join a gym became bread though I ordered the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly\nThey are words but the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on her just them people like just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent the ...\n[laughter] I said hey Bob can you do it and Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank in soft still regain health dressed and fleet off with me Clement who calls from very different in tone and really quite marvelous\nHe got the pale face in there you got the gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number so that's just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nails before he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard ... who's\nColleagues friends chicken D. I. decree a fine day even got his wife to do one\nDaughter away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee the group that was all bird themed hope you scoop into ham apple jam and French\nGrant you go running around from town to town and saying hey I got a bone everybody want\nEither related and if I Am a person of binges this began a been she might say\nThat they ended up becoming a seven hundred page book filled with translations of this pump go ahead and read out of the best one\nOkay okay okay this is also one of his but like a Twenty one he did\n... gal so Sweet Honey from up some dumb bug drag you down that friends feel the urge bugs for\nFrom the Sergio emerging attract sound advice from Doug slash clown so smashed blues\nCome you who come you who lived through sheets eschew sweet less to top a tart make your heart pounding tasting Clemens mandate sure hope God cures your body had defeat ... there has got jealous\n[laughter] why does that have been at its humor yeah\nAlthough not the best he says I I I Do want to get to my mother's translate ads here where's my mother's was\nSomehow I'm going to have to look it up here where I was just focus on confiscated and see if we do\nThis one from his mom these has came along years after he started here it is and he thinks it might be the winner\nHigh to get well hospitals prison in prison tell ... well ... years though Columbus orders in a nutshell go pick out votes wide your mouth he's so sweet me going south\nMay be threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight or with strong support and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about we have\nPreviously called for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can jak but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry on this uh this fellow oh yeah no I followed\nAfterwards hey man [noise] um [noise] can you pronounce your name for me [noise] my name is on uh\nUm I was like you know when you when you listen what happened there and I must sound like some kind of cultural a guide me is that\nAmericans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African states new series and I'm using a generally they say no or you could and not just speak are you going to do\nYeah this is as us exactly my point is going to take sanctions maybe going to be the obvious ones yeah do you feel that that question put you at risk maybe who knows is that does the job description doing good ...\n[laughter] [noise] make so much thinking you're going to give it to me from my numbers on there\nSo that conversation was about five months ago did you do know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether did he suffered for this question in any way nobody ... I can give them a call in and sign up\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I Know what I mean it's it's Gregory Gregory Warner oh legally I enjoyed I\nReached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nThat I started learning not to read a book on on together them in the Arctic shipping and that\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah\nThese messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism taskforce will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf you\nBelieve in John ... out of the ones that are saying these kinds of it\nAnd were they threatening yeah some\nOf them were you know you can get in there that would be struck quoting the ...\nDo you need is planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nSick you might say skate\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brothers that are big ding us Washington\nOkay Washington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah ... ... what is your mom say\nShe said please don't do that ... it might be you know try to give you things like that you know ... like that they're yeah they're like that yeah\n\n\n... or\nA ball you\nYeah by any\nMeans a ...\nThe last on\nRadiolab will continue minimum ...

this guy was a sheer Luttrell now you're try\nThis one a Robert Krulwich and our producers Owen we'll or talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin and why is George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language\nTalking about the comedians of media yeah [noise]\nThat we use all the time is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling nurse and I really like just went to his about how Carlin hated euphemism I don't like words that hide the truth I don't like words that conceal reality I don't like euphemisms an American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both as he called\nMe I Know people in this country no long road people we shift them all away and we brought in these\nSenior citizen [noise]\nAnd he was on some of that's the reason we use ... and I've just\nBeen through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs so that hill\nPass out before he dies and so on\nAnd so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to decide something that you cannot disguise but Karlan is real point was that it it does\nOur reactions to it that actually have like I have a negative effect and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming PATS to you know he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battles for the battle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after ...\nThey became post traumatic stress disorder ... but we added a hyphen and then it became peachy as\nPost traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blended out the words so if you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some\nFor some interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying it's just like now that his PATS Steve we're not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nShell shocked I'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at that time [noise]\nAnd now you're putting your finger on this this is where the [noise] the rubber meets the road [noise]\nShe says people see

a ride ... corner they should give ...\nIn the remaining few minutes we're going on an army fishing\nExpedition [laughter] sure sure it's the here's here's the here's our quandary Karl Case religious situation we're doing Sean ... okay so recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name ... we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nGot his I got a little insistence liberal and just in a 'cause you're like our innate we got to learn I guess I said that are and I like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do or nay and I was like but is there a story and you're like no\nNo I didn't say that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as often happens you or me down\n... it was like All right fine let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town I think your your son's getting married yes he was and uh her I was doing like tech team worked for me [laughter] okay\nAll right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins mhm [noise] right and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure really yeah\nIt was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's the quick story so what happened was\nOkay so just to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad and Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically the rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string eight\nShe teen piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff the stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like how did this for simple base has become the assets to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... this is a code\nProblem [noise] ... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein\nSo I just need to think of a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Duke ... [noise] and then out comes the protein like what what simple toad could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out two sides I think\nThat ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\n[noise] like instead of a T. C. G. A. C. came out that maybe it's a TA C. C. J. D. C. A. A. C. A. G. ...\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triples not care 'cause if you have a sense of three or rather than to the game I figured well that'll give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins\nNow this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick\nA group of other scientists worked it all out there\nSort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting there\nAll boiled I'm a set of molecules come along attached to it and zip it and not be as\nThis copies now made of ... which is like DNA very similar instill in the basic sort of four letter for that but it's not on the move is pedals over to this big old factory in the cell called the rabbit so [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "14"}
