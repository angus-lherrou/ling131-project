{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "\nListening to radio [noise] radio from W. N. Y. [noise] [noise]\nI'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we [noise]\nStrong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that who don't but we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we might as well we ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make as one of them yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight George how bout with a song yes please check\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young to middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you the organizer\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie\nMiller and what what are you calling from St Louis\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this they want to\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shots Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud Facebook do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against roe kingdom muscle what we can say in what we can't say that again\nBy this iconic photograph what we can see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nThe Internet\n\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr sack\nOf arc I got to ask you do you subjectively prioritize or sensors speech\nCongresswoman or we don't agree with what we're doing a censoring speech but there are types\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text documents that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook that digital documented it's about fifty pages if you print it off and died in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter] [noise]\nBecause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room\nTrying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand seismic change in this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice face time\nIs now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids\nAnd so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table\nEach of them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook and I'm like meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days\nSent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and\nEvery time something pop up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take a doubt and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou would turn near pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard or what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that day at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so is Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[laughter] rise fight for the lights that replicating\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one day changed\nTo the title of our group pay Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for it and tell them the on photos of women brand new meeting their chilled right down in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the wrong\nThing by sitting in that I did hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nShow the Internet is an interesting Dr phil it was a media storm\nEventually perhaps as a result of our group and our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by the end nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define nudity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female genitalia and then visible female breasts and then the question is well okay how much of a breast needs to be showing before it's Newt and the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially the nipple and Ariel lower\nAnd so there's a lot of renting infamy happening\nA lot about the good work if I can go now I I'm Sorry to bother you know I'm Sorry you work in but\nI mean like we just came out of there [noise]\nI Know your life in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they signed well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing are willing to talk do you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather die that's totally fine you know I was ... I don't want to add up here\nExplain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to\nWe'll talk about what a ...\nWind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and company which if your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor Jessica Lynch has just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have all yeah I tell you after so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ... and he\nKissed a case by case by case what are you ... every day it was just as much as I said well it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nA lot of that's just like they all got ... uh it's too I think the ... to extradite or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nFederal has exploded able to you know get squashed by attached to you know take okay just it was ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I was having sex with a play and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as he does is\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd catch himself thinking about these\nIt was ... ... ... S C I was like okay I ... I have to walk away\nAnd I just I have to I I [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they are going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr they're getting better automate that they had the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of the terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be a joke to me is hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back and I think we should\nHi this is Jenny calling for le ... radio lab is supported by transfer wise and online service that let people send and receive money internationally and their border Leslie countless customers hold and convert multiple currencies anytime more transfer wise dot com and the\nShame that from him\nIn communities nationwide future at high level an apple broadcast or whatever broadcaster found\nSupport for Ninety three three double ... provided by the Cleveland [noise]\nSimon ruler my the master of [noise]\nI'm for you to come to the classic launcher which improvised to come by in his time to sit on the grand Norton memorial\nOregon [noise] the launcher one night only October twenty six on the big screen ...

you don't want to hear this kind of thing and give me their kids in the room mate would fit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once [noise]\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April Fifteen to twenty Thirteen strike\nAin't gonna let Rhonda Maryland but by the way to make it up that you can break we add

occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published\nOn line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nWe realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together and sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however have to ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy essentially this photos being posted everywhere\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls\nAnd there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the\nGuidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down\nBut before they can pull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organizations strengths parents\nLet me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of\nPaper all when Dr bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically sucker burg and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization that could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this\nIs is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than white people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera and then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head\nSo reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years now and\nThere'll be is covering the drug war in doing so years back she noticed the strange phenomenon it\nFirst caught my attention and early two thousand ten she'd be checking social media you know you're scrolling
