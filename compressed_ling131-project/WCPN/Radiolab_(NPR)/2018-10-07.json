{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WCPN", "content": "\nListening to radio [noise] radio around WWE and why he [noise]\n[noise] [noise] they're\nGoing to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something\nHigh [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good good\nWhere are we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started to the game is what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris than devote John over the counter and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nThere a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYou know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency ... and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those\nThe public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented Brazil\nBurst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records law suit\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think I spent three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years worth of paper any\nPaper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work county police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nAnd then put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B bay county book or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through the\nAlphabet and he basically just have a all these uh manila photos with tons of papers and by the costs and in ...\nAs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings the represent a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen [noise] so he did was go through all of this material scraped each of those\nThe SWAT Team that involve a an armed suspect was or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions from lessens some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is called mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raised as a weapon toward\nI'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs that you see\nOnce or twice a week but it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to Ben central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern cells much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and as we've had they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very\nForeign percent six kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's [noise] gets me is like the I\nDon't know it's back to where we were and why we want to start this methane gas ... still just moved by the single case is the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nThe Cato sterile police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five it's confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife at a party to fight for every one of these every report is at least one human life if someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nSo we have on this table that the investigation but death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and Ben traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org\nAnd you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you about today but I'm\nNot I guess we'll just turn it over to you know you're okay a ... day one yeah where was this place again\nSo after the event ended up the community center\nCrystal took a bunch of the mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shops\nLike you guys do this every every event or a no no just wanted to know the ones and has been telling everyone involved in\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but figure this must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way it was a crystal\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point I was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand\nShe says his age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over the crystal\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nSummer's wildfire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel room again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over it and how we see each other bad on the couch you know a mattress and it becomes like a huge sleep over\nAnd the rest of the policy for talking you know getting to know each other a lot of ... or the vice over his shoulder thoughts like therapy for us\n\nUse let me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women just really stuck with me I Believe or add um sex Marlon problems and it was when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlin was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this past\nMoms house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are because the garden was here in\nAnd all that\nWell I Am saying 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here is all you can smell was on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in your time to just brings you right back here mhm\nYep\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nCause I started ... some of the other one that started to cry\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my ... a lot of what a bad economy\nA couple of women had to be their phone my phone number [noise]\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face alright three two one\nThree two one\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing with us because I Know it\nI think that we have we haven't been out here in\nIt was a set of very faint we used to go there once a week\nAnd I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son was about Fifteen minutes for our yet every time I visit\nHome I have to go there all the time for a bank yeah that was for how could you not\nThen I Know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit there yeah and it's crazy because like if a with and it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you can go about is like a certain time every day and it's this little white man we share\nEverything like that are like he literally I think he does he like to go have lunch with every day\nBy day and in the ... I don't know if you if it's a cemetery that way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take his chair ikea hold\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nMentioned one year ago\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter was loaded into the ground\nAnd it was around this time that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nKind of felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a nice day\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment we ended up getting it\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about slow like W.

and that's the point to eat at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that women you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first worn and let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nYou know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that interests\nA black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there there's a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of or a poor that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nAvoided through the neighborhood is limited on the front steps waves of hatred what
