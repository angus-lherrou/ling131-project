brand new building in a mostly warehouse looking district\nGood morning it's nice to have you here it's ah\nIt's cool to be your best Jeanie Buss she's the reason we were there she's the president and CEO of the Los Angeles Lakers\nThis is the UCLA Health training center the Lakers training facility\nIs a nice nice building as but fits a sports franchise worth more than three billion dollars but the Lakers are more than just a basketball team right they are a global brand and one of the great teams in NBA history although not recently and not really the season yet but more about that in a minute\nFundamentally the Lakers are and this is the way ... dad longtime owner of the team Jerry Buss would have wanted it during the entertainment company with outsized influence but you got to deliver on the court and lately as I said the Lakers haven't\nSo Jeanie Buss went after and she got this past offseason LeBron James the best basketball player in the world right now and she brought him to this building there is tons of natural light clean modern lines also a whole lot of purple and gold all with the business of basketball firmly in mind we\nMoved here just over a year ago we had outgrown our other training facility which is just a couple of blocks away and our entire revenue generating arm was in a building across the parking lot so we were a very divided company\nThis was as we should are overlooking basketball courts in I mean there's\nProtects that we ended up choosing talked about how architecture could change culture in an organization\nAnd that was you know exactly

are okay or they'll follow me ...\nThis way and as you notice um we have I think six or seven conference rooms so this one is called twenty ten\n... address on the front there regard for the for the

morning says take where the draft is\nDo you know ... or one two three four uh four or five what\nAre these are the best guess would you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and ... you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if ... you know we are one of the players we\nCan do is worried rooms with his room's right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms joke so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but
