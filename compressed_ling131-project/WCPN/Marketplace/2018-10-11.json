worse Jimmy Fallon gets years I mean ... yeah because\nI think I'm a first there's a little if there was you off a little bit you know people have history like I just didn't pop up you know out of out of nowhere but I'm sure on what to do you ever look around and say I'm a kid from Philadelphia man what am I doing\nMore [noise] more or less a it's held that I did hear often when I go back to Philadelphia I'd do something called chasing ghosts\nAre still in my first car and I keep it up I'm Sorry you still have your first car I still I still utilize it yeah and I go to my mom's house and I get it and usually I drive around\nWhen I go to Philly I'll drive from like midnight to three in the morning literally just chasing ghosts and the thing I always do is when I go past\nThe place where the roots used to a mosque on um fit than south street there I'm always like yellow like back in Nineteen Ninety two I thought Nineteen Ninety nine was going to be the future you know yeah let alone what I still be a thing in two thousand eighty\nKnow hypothetically but I I just I'm Amazed that no one's kick me out the pool yet yeah we we had um we had ... on the program ... about\nTwo weeks ago and when the whole thing about she got limited want ... called her and you know and she's doing really well and I said how are you made now and she said oh honey you're never made\nUm yeah and even you know this is our our technically are twenty some professional year as a group\nAnd I I still work as if this could all end tomorrow that's why people ask like well you do so many things have Nineteen jobs like when did you get to relax and you just don't in my mind it's it's always this could end tomorrow so don't ever sleep you know it\nDoes it ever surprise you that you have become that guy now to people turn to for advice and mentorship and\nI'm I'm very uncomfortable with that even my Twitter handles says like I'm I'm Better as a student not a teacher like this whole course love is said scholar at the ... right you're bunch of rappers called me like oh gee\n[laughter] no I I kinda shrug it that what would you be here without the Tonight Show I mean you you have said that you looked at the Tonight Show gig as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nI'm I'm resilient so I Would like to think that I've always been something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that the Tonight Show opened up even way more doors than I expected like I I truly thought this was going to be the most gentle mercy killing ever\nKnow as I should I [laughter] I'm just glad I'm not all of them does not ones that I think like oh this could benefit you you know because I was reading on the op eds and even though I Love being under\nLike oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots\nExcept this uh Tonight Show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus getting a New York's ... man and I was actually like good actually what I Want I Want to be underestimated 'cause I Want it to I Want it to to kill all a\nPerceptions of this being a square gig do do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed laid on music [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing or something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing\nAnd we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block and it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start being on Snapchat and that sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music\nThere there were other avenues to explore and we took full advantage of it it it's interesting because there was a lineage right there's doc severance and from the old Tonight Show then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable down in an interview\nAnd the roots that's weird and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of ... and said I Want to like one day that'll be me\nIt's just making the most of it again like in two thousand eight when he proposed it to us that\nWe should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I was like a man we just got to to a place where we were making good money on the road like why will return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our\nLike we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's a way that we could Celine Dion our way into a position now [laughter] I like to use all this stuff is verbs right Seth Celine Dion our way into\nA position where we could still make a good living without having to have lobby called for him and be on the bus for nine hours and that's where ... just fell into our lap and it was like be careful what you asked for\nThere's a ... there's going to get old marketplace in and you know ... management on your hair but I live for that stuff well well good and in fact that's the really the question right because you have said more than a couple of points planning something is the joy of actually doing that something and the question of the out of the question that comes out of it is\nWhat's it like to work for you how do you run the ban how you run the ... how do you run you guys on the show um\nYou know there's there's lessons to be learned about it because again where we're at a phase in our lives where we're not twenty two twenty three like they are here what forty five now yeah I Wish I was okay for early for that but it's a sign of it [noise] um\nSo the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a row and that sort of thing and we used to do [noise]\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that sort of thing not to mention a lot of our side projects\nWell it's weird because one the roots is just one of Nineteen things I'm responsible for we're in a very sweet spot right now where we're actually having more fun with each other socially which is great that we've ever had I realized that we were going to fall apart if\nAs people we weren't having fun with each other you know what I mean so uh\nThanks for coming to figure it wasn't appreciate [noise]\n\nIf you're not one of the very large players you better be offering some products\nTrue in life true also in retirement planning but first sure what the students\nAre all the while I was I don't know about this down does rose up five forty five day two and a ten percent twenty five thousand dollar fifty two ... two point one
