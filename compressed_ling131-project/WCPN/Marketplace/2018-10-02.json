American producers\nSaid the last time you were on marketplace you were scheduled to appear before Congress to talk about your application for an exclusion from the steel tariffs which was denied a how did that have parents ...\nWell the the experience it was everything that you would imagine you know the the stately board room with hundreds of people watching you and um I think it\nIt went surprisingly well like I made my point and there were some changes made to the exemption process that accommodated\nMy concerns as well as the concerns of the three other companies that also testified alongside me my main push was for the exemption requests to be retroactive to the first date they're submitted not the first day that uh the Commerce Department decides to look at the request it entered into their system\nAnd that still didn't give me the exemption I'm Still working on that I'm now talking to US Customs for the correct a import code\nThey there was a discrepancy with that so it it's a it's definitely a bureaucratic process and I'm not happy or not made whole yet but I Do feel like we made significant progress by testifying\nWe've been talking about the tariffs on steel

a lot of stress you know that that was a a deal that could potentially going bankrupt a small companies such as mine but you know with these new terrorists\nI'm a little more relaxed and I have been but it's a these are still uncertain times uh as I mentioned pricing is is it changing story day to day and uh in just overall uncertainty which is also risk and ah it's a risky environment right now

storms like last month's Hurricane Florence recovery is not only slow but expensive some estimates put the damage at twenty to thirty billion dollars for Florence and a portion of that will go to repairing the beaches affected\nThe U. S. government spends a lot of money repairing coastal communities after big storms Lisa song is a reporter for ProPublica and wrote about the high cost of beach re nourishment\nAnd how that money is divvied up welcome Lisa\nThanks for having me at least that can you tell me what beach nourishment means\nWell it's basically when the government comes in and they pump a lot of sand onto your beach to a six the damage to the beaches that have occurred to erosion or through storm damage\nAnd the reason why a federal state and local governments will fund this is that without beach nourishment some beaches in the U.S particularly on the east coast in the Gulf Coast\nAre just getting smaller every year um they're retreating and so the people who own property on the beach obviously want the beach to stay where it is and those beaches are very important to the tourism economy\nHow much does all this cost and where's the money coming from\nIt costs a lot um so many of these projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars\nWould argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies the people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nSo these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "02"}
