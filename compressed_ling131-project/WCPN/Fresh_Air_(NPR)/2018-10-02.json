the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis lifted Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions in the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to fresh air explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is the risk you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture part or even the White House the name of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of this so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump\nAt the fifth race means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration had gone about taking over the federal government what kind of light the fire under me is when I discovered that the Obama administration and spent\nThe better part of a year and thousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course that it ever been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to do receive these briefings or and nobody showed up nobody debris in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprise it's managing all these ... ... ... but we as a society to spend much time thinking about um it it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought\nWhat happens when you do that across a big portfolio risks like the federal government runs and ... ... what you what happens is you\nYou amplify the risk you increase the probability of of these rescue actually causing problems\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis is best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's\nI mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a trivial enterprise the society it we ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nAbuse and scorn in his collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much ... nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know one aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the ... a lot of the risk that the government manages are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up uh you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach and on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department let all that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some ...\nThat can atmosphere it'd ministry nation in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the commerce\nDepartment [laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service titled National Weather service is a bit and now there was a versus the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance\nSo it's there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well\nI'm so here's the problem\nAre typically the person who runs Noah has a has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation\nUm the problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people\nIt's we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them\nAnd I mean and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it\nIt has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead\nAnd that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that\nWell in the first place is the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over is the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and\nYou know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is organized is actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the guy\nOh the high tech stuff that I'm\nNo private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from ...

I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis\nBut I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so\nWhy would a figure trigger a financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the worst\nA U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world with everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it's some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding or predict things where where ...\nWhen they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the ... looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nNext time on the world meet Jesse he comes from a Mexican American family he's been incarcerated for half of his life he was told early on not to mix with prison inmates who are not like him\nYou know we don't engage with them we don't do business with them and if you do you're going to get in trouble at least you're going to get beat up at worst you're going to get them\nBut that's not true in every prison we go to one where change is happening on the world\nComing up this afternoon at three ... three WC P.
