feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today so thank you for being here\nWhen I interviewed your father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs he asked to read a poem that he just written that hadn't yet been published\nBut it's now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of at home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nOr used to be your favorite drop good for one more

and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this bones\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through\nIn time and that you don't feel like you said\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that uh that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that has his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems so\nGo and they want to get on record\nAs say what I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice since you've declined\nI'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play inside the reading and not another promising is\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes in their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was

were born in Nineteen Seventy to some of your father's most famous songs are already written and recorded by the time you were born Suzanne filling Marion hey that's nowhere to say goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear them all you do if you didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs\nAnd singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer see must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course her them you know I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a horse is going out into the looking at the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was an deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the ... and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling language and um\nWhen you grow older than you than you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself was making a record at the time and it's scripted\nOh we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and I was expecting him to put his hand on\nMy shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining\nBut instead he turned to me and said and he's scrap your record that's an amateur move said amateur move he says yeah it's not about\nHow you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also bought their intention out he was holding up this baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground\n[noise] were you and your parents separated um five six from the don't remember how much did you get to see us either after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nSister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father would often\nHe's always been part of our lives you'd always he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation so a caravan has like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the look what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to sell to France where we lived\nIn the long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of Caribbean jet stream type things we put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in how long did I Do that for\nWhat he did that and variations of that through my own entire life and and as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate this week which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happens you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people I'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing his soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think it's your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\nYeah you know as he often\nI'm In incredible that [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself\nAnd um when you experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back out of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and in others you know would quote him and\nUm but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected in\nFestive of periods in his life I was a festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works are studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets\nSo thank goodness for that economic crisis\nSo did he ever get the song writes back she has not seen it really yeah
