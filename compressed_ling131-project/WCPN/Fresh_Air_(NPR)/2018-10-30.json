when did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nAre no ambassador for skateboarding and skateboarding is so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often for church but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more in my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music ...\nI don't know it just made an impression on me so I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\n... than the skaters is that you're in like you were going to be a great skateboard her but\nYou know I guess actually okay and I loved it and it was there was such bombastic personality such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens on having written this film\nHe really showed me you know a lot of what I think was great about it and what are things that I had to and people from that time had to unlearn\nWhat are some things you felt you had to learn from the culture\nThe way people spoke to one another and what they said to one another especially in regards to homophobia and toxic masculinity\nLike there's a scene where um the kid in a movie says to the ... the owner had thank you and the other kids says of ... you can't say that and then he start\nRecklessness which are related to you and I related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and on learn some of this stuff would you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah

money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting whenever\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you be willing\nTo share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah which just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignored the content matter of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter] who is who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because I had a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton vice [laughter] when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because I mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to\nThere's something I Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so\nI Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see 'em they said we are so lenient you don't even realize how lucky you are\nYou cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older than I understood\nThe HIV aids plot Martin of the film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbing and I need to talk to [laughter] I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also asked about that\nYou show so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it is well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old

off of Wall Street [noise] I\nJust I see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior\nAs people and\nAnd you still find humanity in there and I like how unabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do when you're in a movie [noise]\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm going to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our country\nAs a terrible father yet right wing it terrible father [laughter] you just can't be viewed radio show in Italy loving big hearted\nPerson

so many layers\nThink the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise]\nUm\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader an anti Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid
