online identities and use social media manipulation helped defeat Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination in the primary and Hillary Clinton and the general election\nThe proposals were apparently never acted on but we know that Russian operatives made effective use of Facebook and Twitter and seeking to influence the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nOur country is hardly the only one in which political opinions have been manipulated by millions of fake social media accounts promoting messages that are slanted or even made up our guest today pi Wu singer and Emerson working say that social media has also been weaponized in ways that most of us remain unaware of\nLike fueling popular uprisings and affecting the course of military campaigns\nFor instance when the Israeli Army moved into Gaza and twenty twelve the operation was supported by a viral marketing campaign\nVW singer as a strategist at New America a consultant for the U.S military and intelligence community and the author of several books Emerson T broken writes about conflict and social media and was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations\nFresh air is Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWill Peter W sooner and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air you know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in his book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming the military offensive as soon as the German invasion of France whatever\nSo you have this new technology but a conducted everything from\nThe secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes or the rise of Nazi ism goals uh said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also hide strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population\nAnd it's sporadic contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of these things that the contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figured out really radio was what caused all cause of the world to change\nAnd we saw many of the same things play out in the rise of ISIS at a broader level but also it's a military operation it's surprise invasion of Iraq that allowed it to defeat a force that was a multiple times bigger as part of these ways social media is in effect change the world\nLet's talk about that the ISIS invasion of Iraq and particularly when they were a advancing on the city of Mosul how did they use social media to their benefit\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict and social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations VW singer is a strategist at New America at a

the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media [noise]\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and\nThey were hip to the importance of this what did they do so it was actually a that twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching and ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would put out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nTwitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nWhose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nOriginally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects and like any other military they learn they've reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units are in fact one of the ...\nYour military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cars and you know again badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swiss army of swift ease you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army\nUh cause may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at crowd sources so to speak and one of the other tools of the trade one of the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and ... and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nAnd to drive it through your own in the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a ... World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that a Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson working authors of the new book like war the weaponization of social media\nThey'll talk about social media in political campaigns after a break and John Powers will review the new film twenty two July based on the story of a terrorist attack on a summer camp in Norway and two thousand eleven\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from love me it makers of go to meeting the collaboration meeting platform\nThat comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done\nLearn more it go to meeting dot com\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments on line at home at visor dot com\n\nThere's no question about that\nThat high can't wander face here in the closing weeks of this campaign she wanted to keep this raise more vocal [noise]\nI'm like I'm off on that day on the day from the New York times\nJoined us tonight at seven thirty here on daddy point three double Hugh C.

strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nYou were watching your social media feeds during the common\nHide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from open source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh to ah unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the double gang or a narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stop Bush and learn about history we compete ya so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go under what competed very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved the same\nThe sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections and the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some way surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nWonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano\nOr the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and term are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I ... back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks like that could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane of committed something\nGet real world example of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and faith\nDr everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like which oh by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take out and meld together to allow you to a in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in this space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
