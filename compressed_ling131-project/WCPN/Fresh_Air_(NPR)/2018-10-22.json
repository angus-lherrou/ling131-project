Gross and I guess Melissa McCarthy is known for her comic roles in movies like bridesmaids and the heat and for her impersonation if President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is\nHad a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to Lula Bankhead and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flopped she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cats that bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like Dorothy Parker Edna fervor note coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReview in the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote me Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nStart with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secret to jak hop a fellow alcoholic who's grapes by an charm wit and numerous scams and hustles jak is played by Richard II grand each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor\nThat want to do all my friends who did [noise] quite by accident I find myself in a rather\nCriminal physician are home from

understanding the world of elite collectible literary artifact was personal house rulings we fool gene pieces of paper that go with servers I Am selling to come home she goes [noise]\nI don't know why I told you that there was a waste of a secret I should go\nThe only one with her [laughter]\nMelissa McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on at this isn't really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic did her way\nBut I wouldn't call it a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you\n[noise] um I think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic plays so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh [noise]\nAnd you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the Thirteen people at each performance do [laughter] I don't have much impact\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene when\nThe right in the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dress and yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross that comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it okay and then ... none of us felt\nThat way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak get into the film\nGrossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny because it did feel like for lack of a better way to terminate ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what if the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror in the embarrassment of it\nBecause we are things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] with him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality and by doing gross out scenes because they're your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that\nHorrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that we can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said\nThe connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults [laughter]\nInsulting going do [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and lives le mans teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other couple the Leslie manpower a couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do have to say or even you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no what he what he said to me was he called me\nOr what language Catherine language and show me how to relate what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manage for her ... next door some\nMusic man maybe if I looked more like this fake couple looks like there are bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple\nNone of this talk if productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you vote in a jar with my ... bone you're just really scaring me this is what happens when you cornered rat you corner me I won't you drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits\nOn and on with more over the top insults is that's something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of an like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] and never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say you set all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory how'd you improv insults before yes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um characters that you know I think in the heat or especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything she used to kind of ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her\nIn her own authority so it was a big part of that character you know you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is a there is a fun\nNew film can you ever

which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] and it was the always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is ending woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter]\nJust every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shelter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it [noise] so in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly\nI don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise] so I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about\nAre you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think he's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there to somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God I saw the light oh the ever\nPresent or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men\nFlashes climbs up yes and when that light ...\nExplode it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner\nOr manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a well my God it's a really big deal yeah and the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nGot up to I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know [noise]\nYou're you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nWell lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed you know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant I was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect\nClothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it\nAlso thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all\n[laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and save the guy's name I'm like\nWhy doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement which you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a\nAs somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer\nOr you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable\nYou know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important but me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... your strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse when\nMelissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation
