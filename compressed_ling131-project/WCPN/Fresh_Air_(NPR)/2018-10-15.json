what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationships\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years in air okay okay yeah so what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their man parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when\nA lot of you know men in the audience\n[noise] yeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can acres is I I don't have to believe it's oh so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\n\nUm so I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why why tour across America\nAnd we were both kind of being like oh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves this whole freaking time\nAt a law that has been informed by the fact that we have different energy that a lot of the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell her jokes in a different way or different style\nAnd we were beating ourselves up in allowing that sort of\nKind of patriarchal sort of energy to affect our self esteem and then I was like\nI think it's hard to like um imagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would have been\nA game changer for me to just like here to\nBlack women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like the young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about oh this one\nTime I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has ... ... ...\nLike straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so I think in the end\nBeing out numbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows where you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman you write about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight nudes and for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how did you try to overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self doubt come and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in a house and make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans\nAnd again these are champagne problems I just went up ...

work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones\nYou know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a you know everywhere expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe are the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire and um it you know quite harvest that to have to to do that research but I'm very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field worker on the plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's

slavery itself you know and I think he has a sense of themselves as being quite a moral person and\nThen he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place\nIn in the world but he's not really thinking about the fact that you know for all of his scientific pursuits this is being funded by slavery a and he's kind of turned a blind eye to that and
