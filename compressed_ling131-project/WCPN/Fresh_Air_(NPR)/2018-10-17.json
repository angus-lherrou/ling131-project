flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season the series satirized as Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that's a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom course in around\nBut when season one above jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and\nHe spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then let's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rose show\n[noise] in Nineteen eighty ... situation comedy or should the beard on ABC Show which young ... horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agree to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America One on the air for nine seasons starts horses around ... ...\nIt is good to be are truly [laughter] Raphael blah Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou know we were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening up\nReason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and all of sorry oh and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by pat knows Walt is are are straight person in the scene and uh yeah when the allegations are against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause it was and it was truly oh no Charlie Rose ... and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and haven't beat the washed up star of the family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I had been friends with her since high school I mean when I was you know ... in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nUm she was living in Brooklyn at the time and one thing she was doing was drawing these animal people on her own and posting them\nWell it's a it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability well he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in the book maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five what you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad\nSo he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side and he's not trying\nTo paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was means and his mother and they were both mean to bow jak\n[noise] I I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well or not as much jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously though hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans and early on the network has no maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAnyway we did this one season finale where Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her self cleaned up and she was to be in a live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway that we're supposed to be careful\nMoms have a way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger ... Olivia gone for good with of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. out in the cast of stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you gonna do is just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy the show\nRound dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nYou know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and\nOr over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement more so so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the the richer you you and the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the lea for\nSure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about house additives\nThat our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight\nAnd we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nOr it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nOh brick remarks who's threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable but it still feels like we are not\nYou know we see Carrie did a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork with those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about the professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found a tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ... the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bow jak

O. slash NPR drive out to a gym membership for your career\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father helped Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even\nAfter a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of minorities that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says\nNormal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know if actually one of the Jews who control the media I guess I Am\nRight um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nNow you said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would say\nA couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control\nPut out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate in long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nDo it and it was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this acts\nIt's a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say those things so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [noise]\nWell I think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references\nAnd bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that we're seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all I have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think of the funny situation I you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting another story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\nYou know I'm thinking now the comedy central as his running low jak which is the Netflix series now the comedy central there's rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you to you in retrospect ... like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks\nAnd making them or the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their dignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important\nBut as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out\nUm but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and\nHopefully people you know as they have embraced the show Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you\nRunner of the Netflix series bow jak horsemen seasons five is now on Netflix season one is being shown on Comedy Central after a break marine card and we'll review a new book collecting advice columns written by Eleanor Roosevelt\nThis is fresh air\nI marked are warming the world's newsroom brings you the big picture stories and some other stuff you are a law saying you are American and you need to be proud of both I was the only kid it was the first time it gets to my mom found out and I knew that I had to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "17"}
