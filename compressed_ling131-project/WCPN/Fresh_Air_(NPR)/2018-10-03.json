covers of you know Catherine has a feminist and the character and and in the novel a undercover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress in the field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nSo solar trade for what\nIn college sentiments ideologies alive and I didn't have a career and in\nOthers handout should send them the bills for Iowa is an

which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind yeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all variety and Catherine my and Catherine hon in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um you know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's butter and this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like uh\nYou know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of like a license to pursue your or to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available\nTo her I think for a lot of women when you're trying\nTo reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that\nTo you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot of away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish we really afraid you'd waited too long\nAnd not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also his work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that Jews go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very consuming and not\nConducive to having a kid\nI mean the

wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of your feature length films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was not a unique character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nI'm a ... but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about oh you know well you know oh honey you know will you just give that to your ...\nThat's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it\nAnd I and and then it was sort of I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise]\nAnd maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his suit and hadn't had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when you live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nHe was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not you didn't depict him as the appreciative type [noise]\nI'm right and there isn't a strange men need between you between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of\nNo the complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parents did during that time has made you so focused on the idea of family [noise]\nYeah I mean I I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there is actually for children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother or arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me\nUm had been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower ... high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to move with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it's because I he\nStudent housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents he paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents know when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother was just you know getting a PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and\nUm you know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nSchool\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent\nAnd having hostile relationships with our landlords because my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food and the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives\nIt was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ... yeah ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off mass of ... so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting a ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that said even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary in in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]\nWhatever Jenkins it's great to have you back on her show thank you so much thank you damage Jenkins wrote and directed the new movie private life it opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nAfter a break Marine Corps again will review the new memoir heartland about growing up\nRowse and this is fresh air\nBut us sent a warship through water is claimed by China and the Chinese ship steered right into its path they might well have collided playing a sea going version of chicken is not just the U.S game the u._k.\nAnd France and Japan are all undertaking similar freedom of navigation operations through the south China Sea\nWhy we can expect more close encounters with China next time on the world [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "03"}
