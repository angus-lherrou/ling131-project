N.

it's\nBased on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source the documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars\nFrom his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the

David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president nor his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo incredibly David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a little more global\nHome before he reached the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes a year and by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing um his homes which he built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of these no frills\nHomes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and that has a and so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and he also specialized and\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties and especially with the return of itchy eyes from World war two and he would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap\nFederal loans to build middle class\nHousing and so at his peak this is a guy who\nPresided over real estate empire of you know many many many thousands of units all across Brooklyn and queens in Staten Island to a certain degree um his biggest\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was

weeks ago on how a Donald\nTrump engaged incest backpack schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about I'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans no one million I'm In today's dollars which two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct world that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw this important also it was the first images of these were loans that were never repaired him and he would\nThe dad and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history\nIn Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to just father these very crucial times\nFor more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nCould also see that when he fell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there that Fred Trump safety net was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is the time and it you know the back end of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial\nAt every turn and according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and do well and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's host in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump andme area and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many are\nWe know for sure is that ...\nWell over his state and potentially to use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly patiently built over many decades to use that empire has um potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after a break we'll talk about another skiing used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate empire to

that's progressive\nThis is fresh air and let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters Suzanne ... and David Barstow who along with rescue near published along investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still owned at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision [noise]\nThe interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that for a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his dad\nTwo thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know ... buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo as soon as the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred drawn to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire\nAnd it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that that sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down Donald Trump me it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns\nSo what are you on the low valuations they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families to hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nAvoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ...\nGo shaving skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the store it so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually costs it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession\nOf twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four\nI'm right is the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering how\nYou feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities and so many people still believe the math and Donald\nTrump is still putting forward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to\nSetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off and it gets really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents were there in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spend a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed\nTo go [laughter] you know [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] out of it but we uh yeah it was uh just\nThe three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy [laughter] I don't put a little ...\nAnd it'll cost our focus here I imagine [laughter] but other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um I keep\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could well thank you for your ...\nThank you thank you Suzanne ... and David Barstow reporters for the New York times article reported with Russ Buettner about the suspect tax schemes used a transfer of wealth from Fred Trump to his children was published earlier this month in the New York times magazine\nComing up ... reviews the new album by Eric Church who performed in Vegas at the concert were shooter opened fire on the audience is is fresh air", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "18"}
