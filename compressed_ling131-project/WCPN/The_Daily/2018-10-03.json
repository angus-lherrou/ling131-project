that's there and then he sends lawyers to his father's house to have him signing his father had no idea this was coming and flipped out\nAnd what this document would do is that it would give Donald Trump extraordinary control over his estate upon his death\nThis means that my son's creditors could come after my wealth my empire and shuts the whole thing down\nHe calls his daughter marrying Trump Perry has her organize a legal team that come up\nWith a new will that will make sure that Donald Trump doesn't have any more control than any of his siblings and that his business problems can't dream his own\nEmpire that episode it is this moment this jolt\nIt kind of triggers a deeper reckoning within the Trump family the kids start to recognize dad has this enormous fortune\nHe had all these buildings that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars and he had tens of millions of dollars running through his bank accounts\nAnd what they were recognizing at that moment was that if Fred Trump died all of that every penny of that\nIs subject to fifty five percent a state tax so that means that Fred Trump passed away and it was worth a billion dollars fifty five percent of all of that\nGoes to Uncle Sam and so\nThe trumps come up with a plan a plan beyond the bounds civil law\nOf the first steps they took was to create something called all county building supply all county building supplying maintenance so Fred Trump bought an enormous amount of goods and services to keep\nIndustry he'd write a check get an air conditioner you needed paint supplies go and get paint supplies and then all of a sudden this new company comes along called all county\nAnd it starts buying everything and then they turn around and they build Fred Trump for the very same items at this marked up in price and if they paid a hundred and fifty for the air conditioner day than bill Fred Trump two hundred and fifty in their pocket the debt\nFriends it's a kind of a middle man that's doing nothing this company had no employees that was new and no negotiating of its own literally it's invoice padding\nOperation all county was the company set up with the sole purpose of deceiving the IRS and we've\nRun this scenario past some of the best tax experts in the country and every single one of them says that's fraud\nIt started out relatively small in Nineteen Ninety two but by Nineteen Ninety eight it was generating millions of dollars a year and profits to the Trump children\nBy the time he dies in Nineteen Ninety nine\nHe goes from being a guy who was sitting on tens of millions of dollars of cash to a guy who has less than two million dollars left\nHis biggest asset isn't ten million dollar debt that Donald Trump out him\nIn that in and of itself is a testament to simply how successful they were making cash disappear but the second part of the game was actually maybe the most genius and it involves the biggest tax dodge of all\nBy the early Nineteen nineties there basically through all county and another and see that they set up getting their fathers profits from his empire but their father still owns the buildings themselves hundreds of millions of dollars bricks and mortar and they're going to take control that empire\nWell from one generation for the next in this case with the Trump stuff is having put all of these apartment\nBuildings in a stress they've been systematically low ball the value of each apartment building\nThey find in the Fraser who says some Fred Trump's biggest apartment buildings are absolutely worthless rather than being what they really were which was ten Fifteen twenty million dollar building instead of having them appraises if there were\nOne two three million dollar buildings they put a value ultimately fondness empire forty million dollars\nAnd what we found in our analysis is that in real life in market value it was worth at least ten times that this is an empire that less than a decade later the banks would\nPlace the value of almost a billion dollars\nThe tax experts that we've interviewed are saying that the way the trumps took this legal thing and twisted it is in fact illegal you're not
