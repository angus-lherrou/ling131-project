I. S. E. C. E. O. dot com\n[noise]\nOkay ... we just went through how Democrats are likely to take back the house of representatives how many seats with the Democrats need to take back the Senate\nThey need to gain two seats to take control the chamber it's fifty one forty nine now a tie is broken by the vice president do if Democrats gain one seat Republicans still have control only two they only have to win two seats they need to gain two seats to win two seats Republicans hold and not lose any of their own\nOkay so how many races are there in the Senate were either a Democrat could take a seat from a Republican or Republican could take a seat from a Democrat\nThey're ten races that were watching really closely right now most of them are in seats currently held by Democrats so it's really the mirror image of the house Democrats are mostly on defense\nOr six seats Democrats are defending where they're really at serious risk almost all of them are in states where President Trump won by a huge margin in twenty sixteen so you're talking about senators like Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota Claire McCaskill in Missouri Joe Donnelly\nIn Indiana and these are people who are populist Democrats who\nAre just running up a really big hill and Trump country right now\nIs there any shared story to what puts these three Democrats in danger in those three states you mentioned\nThe biggest forces are definitely national cultural forces but you're also talking about members of the Senate who stood with Brock Obama when he was passing a lot of liberal policy that was just not popular in these places there by and large people who've been strong supporters of the Affordable CARE Act back\nWhen it was unpopular\nDemocrats fighting for their seats given the voting record you just describe what's the case that they're making to their Trump supporting voters in these states\nMany of them are trying to align themselves with the president on a couple of key issues like trade\nMight know how hard North Dakota's wearing and that's why I'm fighting to open up foreign markets Springer I knew a lot of oil and to roll back in PA rules that hurt our farmers Heidi Heitkamp than I approve this message\nYou have mid western Democrats not just in Indiana but also in safer states for Democrats like Wisconsin and Ohio really sort of cheering the president on as he confronts\nTrading partners that Americans see has been devising them economically you see them trying to go after their Republican opponents as elitist and as hypocrites I'm Joe Donnelly and I approve this message\nSo Mike Braun ...\nMillion sweating importing ... for an auto parts from countries like Mexico and China in\nIndiana Joe Donnelly has been attacking his Republican challenger for some of his international business deals\nMaybe they're like Iran and certainly Indiana out\nIn Missouri Claire McCaskill this is maybe the purest form of democratic populism she is just ruthlessly attacking her opponent for being this sort of well groomed Ivy League gentleman who isn't a fighter from Missouri the way she says she is Josh Holly\nNice supported the tax plan giving eighty three percent of the benefits to the richest Americans and corporations\nBut it's really unclear right now whether that's going to be enough for Democrats to hold on I'm expects so if all or most of the Democrats who you mentioned\nTheir seat in the midterms is the story basically that being a democratic senator in a red state is becoming nearly impossible it really could be if those Democrats get wiped out almost every one of them is a really skilled\nI Am large really gifted and they have mostly made the choices you would want a red state Democrats to make if you wanted them to get reelected so if Claire McCaskill can't get reelected in Missouri it's fair to ask who can ...\nSo how about these other four races these are races where the Republican seat is at risk right\nThat's right the races where Democrats are on offense are mostly in diverse states in the southwest from Nevada through Arizona down to Texas where they're trying to mobilize Latino voters and women and suburban voters like the ones we talked about in the house to take over seats the Republicans currently hold\nMe all these things are ... up in public and Congress keep voting convinced me or my mama can't singing mainly for paying conditions\nAnd I would say two of them are races where Republicans are very very clearly in danger and those are the races in Nevada and Arizona and Nevada you've got senator Dean Heller running for reelection in a state that did not vote for Trump where it is really tough for Republicans to win statewide elections and where he has a record now on\nHealthcare especially to shadow him in that campaign\nPromise and voted for repeal deciding\nMr Mr Hitler and I think that is a complete one eighty feet if I'd had non profit from\nThe plane and how they voted to advance would let the insurance industry church people ... up to five times more than younger\nPeople and then Arizona is a state that has changed a lot similar to Nevada but a little bit redder where you have a vacancy or an open seat because Jeff Flake is retiring right and you have to\nWomen running against each other ... on the Democratic side Martha mix Sally on the Republican side and it's a really really interesting test of just how purple Arizona and become the two of their seats are longer shots for Democrats they're essential\nIn Tennessee the open seat where Bob Corker is retiring were Democrats recruited\nThe popular former governor Phil Bredesen to run against Marsha Blackburn on the Republican side and then there's taxes which\nThat's probably the most closely watched long shot race in the country where Ted Cruz is running for reelection against by to overlook\nThe Texas in Tennessee races are really a lot more like the races where the Democrats are on defense user races that are tests of weather really any Democrat can win that statewide race because if Phil Bredesen can't win in Tennessee\nProbably no Democrat in Tennessee\nSo let's say that out all your instincts and leanings in front of ... here are correct we have six Democrats who are definitely in danger for Republicans who are in danger but really only two in a serious way\nMeaning when you count all those up Democrats could lose six seats and only gain for likely fewer so the Republicans not only hold on to the Senate they actually gain seats and ...\nThat is entirely possible at the end of the day is probably more likely that Republicans gain seats in the Senate than the Democrats take the majority in the Senate\nGot it and what should we take away from all of this that the Democrats look very likely to take back the house\nAnd the Republicans look likely to hold or even gain a greater majority in the Senate what does that tell us about our country in this moment and about how Congress represents this country in this moment\nIt tells us of the Senate is much more representative of smaller more rural states and the houses more representative of the more densely populated areas in the country and they're at least for right now at least in the Trump era those are communities that are\nOne way or another tied strong enough to put Democrats control the house and it not only doesn't touch the Senate but actually the Senate goes the other way that just speaks to the enormous division in American experiences between the two parts of the country that these chambers represent really
