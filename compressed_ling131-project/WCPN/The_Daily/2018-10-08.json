until the department of education made a decision once they did that we filed suit and we're all over it's quarter\nYou're all over it and put a hundred and eighty six million dollars is somewhere else and not in the state coffers\nThe question was on public transit and all I heard you say was the state has to play a role but you won't tell us what it is I've said very specifically what I'll do we will put bonded finance package on the ballot for the voters to prove they approved infrastructure four times the last Thirty years\nRevolutionary for the first time we will support public transit as part of that we will get them in place why is it important because we need to make that investment in Ohio half the states have that investment we don't\nBut secondly we need to get that in place because eventually the federal government which promised infrastructure hasn't delivered will bring it a ... and ...\nState and local match on that federal program we'll have our ducks in a row and we'll be able to leverage the maximum federal funds to really build public transport in the state but to have twenty seven counties where there's no public transport you can't get from home to work\nUnless you have an operating vehicle is unacceptable in Ohio and we need to think about that particularly in our cities we know public transit has a crying need we'd never financed it to say that the state has to play a role but he's not willing to do anything I've heard him talk about blue ribbon commissions\nWhich is another excuse for I'm not ready to leave but will tell you about it some time after the election\nDoesn't get the job done for places like Cleveland who need to see a commitment and leadership from the state government on this and I have a very specific approach that Betty Sutton and I have laid out in the store and help us get this done\nTimes that Virginia why spend most of your time on on the attack instead of talking really about what you think should be done in the state and the state of Ohio again you continue to mislead people are all on e caught in so many many other things he caught\nWith something that you could have taken action on there was a there was a ... report which clearly showed that there was a problem and you you did absolutely nothing is that to them\nAs Cordray several people from around Ohio set of questions the high commission regarding abortions specifically the law in a state that defined Planned Parenthood which is now in federal court and then the ban on abortions after a Down syndrome diagnosis if you went as governor it's possible and even likely they'll be working with the Republican led legislature which has helped pass some of these laws actually haven't acted they fought\nWith this in mind and the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh now on the Supreme Court how would you keep your promise to protect reproductive rights\nBecame the first thing I Will do is I Will protect reproductive rights Betty Sutton and I will protect them in the state Mike DeWine has had no respect for those rights he's gone so far now is to say no exceptions even for rape or incest that's too extreme for Ohio this legislature has passed\n... even the ones who were unconstitutionally the ones where you and I ended up paying attorneys' fees out to the party out of taxpayer monies\nOr I Will tell the legislature don't bring those bills to my desk because I Will veto them he has said he will sign a heartbeat bill that heartbeat bill will set back the business climate and the state because it's too extreme John ... vetoed it but Mike DeWine has said he will sign a\nRight to choose or something and to make their own health physicians is something we should be protecting in Ohio and I will protect it let me say what else\nIf we get this out of the way this obsessive manic obsession with defunding Planned Parenthood taken way healthcare there and restrictions on abortion we can actually make progress on maternal health issues where the legislatures neglected them prenatal care post natal care infant mortality which we know is a crisis in the state protect from the African American community\nThe legislature has done nothing about it we need to reprogram them in a different direction so they can be more helpful in terms of helping the state move forward on real problems that we're experiencing right now it's only\nFair and thank you I'm pro life um you know friend I have eight children we value human\nLife is all people do what they have children or don't have children\nBut\nThe central function of government is to protect the most vulnerable members of society that includes the unborn it includes moms who are in very difficult situation it includes\nBabies who because of the mom doesn't have the right nutrition or it's taking drugs or the thing so you're going to see it in ministry ration\nAnd I we talked about this already before it's going to spend a lot of time a lot of focus and put she never get money on early childhood development but we're going to start with home visits early on\nRon take that the first year from four percent to twelve percent we will do more than that as we go for it because I truly believe how we take care of those kids early on and how we help moms and dads take care of those kids moms and dads who are in difficult circumstances is going to make a huge huge difference for\nThat child for that family and for the rest of the state\nFor a third of profile we agree about taking care of kids early on where we don't agree as your extreme agenda that even in cases of rape and incest a woman could not exercise a right to choose a Fifteen year old gets raped by her uncle and she'd have to carry that\nChild to term that that the dust to term because he knew as a man or going to dictate to her from Columbus and say that this was the way it has to be for everyone that's wrong that is not respecting rights that his trampling on people's rights\nGrown women have the ability to make their own decisions they should be respected in the right to do that it's been honored in the U.S constitution and it should be held in Ohio next question to minister to wind Jerry rash\nThere's sort of one you would freeze tuition so students would pay the same price they're charged as freshmen for all four years of college [noise] would you increase state funding to colleges and universities whose budgets may be too tight to accomplish that\nJerry I think that the people who will point to the board\nYou one more song responsibilities of of governors to appoint people to the board of trustees or state universities need to understand\nThat young people cannot pay what they've been paying and that the debt that is piling up on young people it is wrong we have to start running or universities more like a business now they're not exactly a business but there's a lot of parts of them that are and so having people in there who understand that is very important\nWhat you're seeing in the state of Ohio it most state universities today and it private universities is there\nDoing trying to get transfer students\nSome of them or looking at people who are not typical college age and are making a real fish for them those are the types of things that have to be done\nIf our colleges are going to continue to be good in the state of Ohio and if they're going to be able to supply for reasonable price what the students need\nSo it's the ability to adapt is the ability to modernize its the built ability to take new technology to the to the heights um that needs to be done and that's what the leadership and these colleges have to have these universities have to have a ...\nMe talk about the pattern of what we've seen tonight and we've seen it in all these debates time and again we have an issue an important issue a and Mike joins comment is\nSomebody will figure it out later on I don't know what we're going to do somebody will decide on name and opioids are somehow they'll solve the crisis unnamed people to the boards of regents and somehow they'll figure out how we keep costs down on names somebody to be a partner with local government we don't know what we're going to do for them\nOutside the state has to play a role in public transit but I don't know what that role is\nGovernor's office is about leadership the governor sets the agenda then the governor has to work with the legislature to implement that agenda for there's a lot the governor can do on his or her own uh and that's important are right\nOn the issue of higher education I have said we need to have more two plus two programs working with community colleges to make college more affordable we need to work to get more college credits available to students in the high school so they can get head start on this are great community colleges are excellent alternative for people are very affordable alternative or we can invest more in that\nWe can also work as a state to optimize federal student grants and loans make sure we're pulling down every dollar for families who really don't know how to navigate this many of them don't even fill up\nPeople there's much that we can do but the governor has to lead the governor has to have plans the governor has to be willing to spend political capital to implement those plans it's not enough to say somebody will figure it out our Sunday we need more concrete approaches back and that sort of wine thirty seconds for about\n... ... you you not read it led any job you've ever had your ... what about tell that to tell that to the rape victims who ...\nRight right right I get back to the rape and he didn't start on that there were twelve thousand you know like I started one of those things like that and I say ... is and I will do is governor is every State University where not only judge that State University on how many people they graduate what percent but\nI think that we can start looking to see where those students or a year after they graduate I think we should judge them why that is important", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "08"}
