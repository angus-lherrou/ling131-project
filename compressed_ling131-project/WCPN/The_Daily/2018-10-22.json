P. report that fifty three thousand Georgia and particularly African Americans were placed on any Hindi voter list hadn't really exploded the race what does that mean exactly\nIt means that that exact mash law is doing whether it was intended to do it means that these people are ones who applied to register to vote\nBut the government found that there was some mismatch we both saw my ... Hi Fay or it could be an address change that\nPut it in the question mark category and they have created a list of those which told those fifty three thousand Georgia and do we know who those fifty three thousand Georgians are\nWe know that Seventy percent of them are black wow and that speaks to what the voting rights activists call this intentional racial voter suppression Stacey Abrams has said we're\nDeeply worried that fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election\nThat this was a racially motivated he knew from experience that this law has a disproportionate effect on certain community politically motivated attempt for the secretary of state to benefit himself and the governor's right Brian camp has said that these pending registrations\nAre a result of shoddy work by democratic activist groups who are trying to register these voters that this is all just the controversy that was ginned up by Democrats and there's no real truth to it he has also said\nOil I mean she won't civil eagles to vote in Georgia I mean this is a shocking development\nHard work in Georgian should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like my opponent won't\nBad or any evidence of that she said on the campaign stop last week that\nBut the thing that is a blue wave is African Americans\nIt's white and Asian Pacific Islanders\nTold that they are not worthy of being here\nWere documented an undocumented the\nBlue wave quote is comprised of the undocumented and the document it Brian Kemp is to use that literally saying that she wants undocumented non citizen to go to the polls she denies\nThat I'd never once argued for anyone who was not legally allowed to vote in the state of Georgia should be allowed to vote for what I said that day is that this is a state that should be looking out for everyone in our state she was meaning this is who are fighting for [noise]\nI've\nSeen the ... going back and forth so I just decided to go to Georgia and talk to voters and see how this was playing out on the ground and what do you find in talking to the voters who are on this kind of
