this testimony that prompted so many people to come up and talk about recovery those high school days after the hearing what was interesting was the gloves came off\nOne of who's ... classmates says the person who's you portrayed himself to be to do does not match the person she knew at Yale room\nAnd you suddenly saw of some of the people who had been reluctant to speak to me in the first place on national television\nI don't buy it I I um I didn't that's not the bread I knew as soon as I met him in college it's not the bread I sighed during four years at Yale\nTalking about Brett as a drink or who would get incoherent\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Wylie yeah he was a big party are often drank access and there had to be a number of night where he does not remember\nI had one of my sources say to me anyone who says that he wasn't rip roaring drunk isn't telling the truth\nAnd I would have stayed on the sidelines if he had said um I drank to access in high school I drank access in college I did some stupid things I'm Better now but I never sexually assaulted anybody but to lie under oath to lie about\nThat then what else is true to beat ... you know and the highest position and the judiciary in our Lance and not know the difference between truth and lies that that's just terrible it's\nJust kind of let loose in a whole new way and what was also interesting was that whole sense of loyalty to him and those who are still protecting him\nWhile also was eroded where this suddenly became a little bit of a come to Jesus moment where people realize they had to choose sides and if that meant losing friends it was worth it the stakes were too high and they were\nIn ... he was the class of eighty seven he was a basketball player a very big guy he said he had a statement he was going to give it to me Monday today he ended up giving it to me last night and it was pretty powerful statement or did it say he talks about how he was formerly reluctant to speak\nBut he didn't necessarily think Brett's alcohol use in college had relevance\nBut that now after hearing him on Fox and hearing him testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary committee\nHe became quote deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization buy bread himself or his drinking at Yale and quote and how does he describes\nThe drinking you saw he goes on to say that especially in their first two years of college when he often drank with Brett quote on many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not all of which was here when Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nOn one of the last occasions I purposely socialize with Brett I witnessed him respond to a semi hostile remark not by just using the situation but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail [noise]\nSo he is actively refuting the characterization the judge Kavanaugh offered in Fox interview and most importantly under oath before the central committee\nRight and even subsequently after putting this out yesterday Chad talk to me about how it was important to him that we portray that this was about truth it was not about college behavior and I think that is an important distinction that is what bothers people\nIs the degree to which Brett is not representing himself accurately not the behavior itself well I think Robin makes a good point here which is that it's the idea of\nMaybe some crafts comments I've talked to people who said you know I did worse than bread did whatever it was\nBut the idea that he would be untruthful about this a sitting judge who's nominated for the Supreme Court that he would be dishonest and belligerent about these things on the stand in front of the nation in front of the Senate Judiciary committee\nReally oppose them ... that is the kind of thing where people say two things like it's the cover up not the crime\nWhen all this reporting started the question originally but we were all asking was did Brett Kavanaugh commit these alleged acts of sexual assault and now the question is in the process of defending himself against those charges\nDo Kevin not knowingly mislead and sees the public and also members of the United States Senate about what seem in comparison to those original allegations like smaller matters\nI think that's absolutely right I think you've got what is a very grave\nAnd relevance to character and ability to serve on the Supreme Court accusations about an attempted sexual assault many years ago\nAnd then you have these behavioral aspects about drinking and\nPossibly blacking out and whether he could stand up straight and bragging about her not alumni club which may have seen like very marginal details even a week ago mhm but now they seem to be front and center in evaluating the truthfulness and really the fitness of this judge\nThink one area that we perhaps having delved into enough is this idea of what being blackout drunk means I think that sometimes it's conflated with passing out and it's easy for Brett Kavanaugh to say that he doesn't have a memory of doing that or didn't do that there is a feeling among many people I talk to\nThat he was often in that condition so that some of these events which were\nYou know fully entertain as possible\nAnd I'm hearing the same thing there was one alumnus I talked to who said he actually believes both Christine Blasey Ford and he believes Brett Kavanaugh he thinks Brett Kavanaugh\nAt least in terms of the lousy Ford accusation is telling the truth as he recalls that he thinks the missing link that might help the connective tissue for the two accounts is that Kavanaugh at the time had an over drinking problem he blocked out and he truly doesn't remember\n... so now that there's an FBI investigation into Dr Bob before jog Asian or the people that you've been talking to Robin from Brett Kavanaugh's time of you are they saying what effect that FBI investigation is having on their decision to come forward and share their recollections\nI have several people who even had yet to share information with me who now said they're waiting to tell what they know to the FBI\nAnd then as these days have passed they've lost faith in the idea that they're going to hear from the FBI and in some cases some of them have taken it among themselves to reach out to the FBI on their own [laughter]", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "02"}
