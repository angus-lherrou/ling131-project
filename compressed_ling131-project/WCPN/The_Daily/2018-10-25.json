Q. issues but I think\nThat those issues\nI I don't know if I'd like to say that they have aged well or poorly I I Would simply like to say that they present a challenge to Republicans going forward even if in the short term they're working it would seem to the benefit of President Trump and the Republicans\nWho you were anticipating where my mind was moving which is that certainly his latest two thousand for gay marriage seemed to be working in the Republicans' favor but as you're pointing out millennial Republicans now more of them have a gay marriage not\nToo many older Republicans are keeping mount about this issue I keep thinking about how John Kades during the debates you know again this response when asked about gay marriage where he just basically said that his God told them to let everyone\nKnow I I think I think that the gay issue is a little different than some of the other cultural issues\nOne of the things that's happened is that everybody today knows gay people that\nWas not always the case really has people kept it hidden\nAnd an awful lot of the Republicans you're talking about are confronting a different reality which is this is no longer a theological issue or theoretical issue this is about my friend jak gr my friend Linda or the people that I Know\nLooking back on it do you think that they were on the wrong side of history\nYeah I mean on that one I Would say yes\nYes then more broadly\nWell I don't know I don't want to broaden by response on that you know I don't want to say that's true of cultural conservatism generally\nI I I Would not extrapolate [noise]\nUh well during\n\n\nThe daily it's supported by how much nicer matching homeowners with home improvement professionals full of variety of home projects for minor repairs to a major models homeowners can read reviews of local pros added book appointments online at home at ... dot com\nAnd by fracture creating mattered photo decor and gifts by printing photos directly on glass a fracture is an image frame and mount all in one hand made in a carbon neutral Florida factory learn more at ... dot com slash daily\nSupport for ... three W CPS is provided by\nThe Cleveland council in world affairs presenting ambassador ensure who'll explore us relations with the Netherlands the long standing us Dutch partnership and areas for continued future cooperation Monday October twenty ninth C.
