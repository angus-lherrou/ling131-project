October twenty fourth at six PM in Berea registration happy W. dot edu slash open house\n[noise]\nIs the memory loss for the bell\nSo on the same day that this new climate report came out this economist William Seward house whose idea is cited throughout the report as the central solution to climate\nChange you would want us to William ...\nAlso won the Nobel Prize in economics\nFor integrating climate change in the long run macroeconomic analysis is that a coincidence\nI'm going to go with no [laughter] and the Nobel Committee was very clear that they were awarding this prize she William Nord house specifically for coming up with the idea of a carbon tax to solve global warming\nNor do most of the whole issue the caller is appropriate ... which\nI think it's highly unlikely that that's a coincidence because usually closed today it was it was a good class so that was last Sunday so two days later I flew back home from Korea and the next day I went to visit William Seward house at ...\n... talk about the ideas and and what exactly is this idea of carbon price shorts or this or do you wish to gradually emerging them either wasn't something that just moved a light bulb went off\nHis idea his sort of breakthrough idea was how can we apply economic to the environmental damage\nThat we know it's caused by carbon dioxide and so we'll start has created this economic model that looked at the science of climate change and how much damage is caused by heat trapping emissions and how you can extract from that\nThe amount of damage caused by a single ton of carbon\nSisters anything who reports of importance with person\nRising sea levels that would say damage your home and you know raise your insurance costs are lower your property values All right well that costs has been inflicted ... by a certain amount of carbon dioxide it's it's a complicated model he called it the social cost of carbon\nPricing carbon putting a price for this ending the season for that they're covered up and then just a force to renew to take\nThat with a true breakthrough once you came up with the social cost of carbon then you can apply that to policy you can take that over to the realm of governments dealing with carbon pollution and you can in a perfect world use it at the tax\nSo if if we go back to the basic idea of carbon price which is that you want to raise the prices according to the public so consumers but most of them and producers find less carbon intensive was producing them\nAnd what the scientists who wrote this new report and white economists who have been studying this issue for years have said it did pretty much the most powerful and effective way to stop greenhouse gas emissions if polluter have to pay the same amount that they are damaging the environment to pollute\nYou're going to create all kinds of market signals\nConsume consume less carbon intensive lectures who but also produces will move [noise] coal to natural gas and natural gas to say when so it's it's this is obvious substitution effects\nElectric utilities are going to say wow wind and solar are suddenly looking a lot cheaper\nSo if she which does all kinds of energy would know the best his money and say wind turbines rather than transfer over what does that that's where the futures and that it's it's not because it's just so sweet spots with corporations because it's a story for regime and if it sees these prices\nRadical way economists have looked at this and they've said this is the way to send them market signal and you know if we see this implemented around the world that is how you turn around the entire global economy and it was that idea that ... won\nThe Nobel for and that the scientists who wrote this new climate report elevated and said look this is it this is the solution this is what we've got to do\nSo basically his plan is to create a market incentive to solve climate change exactly sticker price on it and then the market does the rest\nWill do this or we need a global problem\nYeah but normally\nIt's pretty clear in order for this story\nSo global programs is a\nCorporate shill nations corporate [noise]\nAll the other ... smooth fifty us do most\nCountries have to do that and to be clear there's new federal Carmen talks right now and you\nKnow there's no federal carbon tax there's no federal carbon prayed some states have experimented with different forms of upcoming pricing most notably California\nAnd has never been deployed at national level anywhere in the world yeah\nI think people may not be aware though how much has been embraced abroad\nWhat I find to be really interesting and an ironic about the idea of carbon pricing is that it's considered sort of politically toxic in the United states and yet it's being implemented all around the world was widely used in Europe Australia put in place a carbon pricing\nModel twin who's the one in British Columbia\nCanada is moving forward to a national carbon price my next year\nYou know being graduated in ...\nMost of the world's major economies are at least starting to implement some form of\nWhat exactly keeps us from experimenting with carbon pricing if so many of our fellow nations were doing a U.S politics\nAnd it just happens if this particular [noise] see this one has to face the wrath of\nOh pool of\nThinkers for\nTaxes have become politically toxic there is a powerful anti tax lobbyist Grover Norquist who has Republican members of Congress signed pledges that they will never\nVote to raise taxes racist the biggest and most controversial tax increase that you can imagine the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch\nHave been absolutely out front in rock solid opposition to this there\nYou know major contributors to political advocacy campaign you know the idea of raising energy costs raising taxes doing some kind of global thing that's endorsed by the un in terms of the politics of this this is sort of at the heart of\nKind of everything that is politically opposed by so many of these powerful forces in us politics right now\nAnd what does he say about what feels like an incredibly formidable wall of opposition\nInside the United states to the plant\nBut what can you say a mood to save a\nTrue Trump's environmental policies or look for I mean there's no coherent environmental either freezes oh so this is their only option flu [laughter]\nWell he takes a long view things change over the long run but he absolutely knowledge is that right this minute because of the current set of political forces\nThe stress response was all\nOf\nUs have whether it was because of the civil war and race\nImportant for\nThe impact of global warming are very unequal league distributes the parts of the world and the population that will experience the most severe impacts are\nLow lying coastal nations probably most of the population of coastal Bangladesh in at one point five or to to be warming scenario will be turned into you know international refugee a lot of countries in Africa that are already grappling with drought but he's still grow crops\nWill experience of transition to no longer ever being able to grow crops again we'll see\nSort of crop land that struggling turn into desert and that will probably lead to food shortages and perhaps than in the report you know laid out that scenario and a lot of political unrest and destruction associated with the impact here in the United states\nWill take a big economic ... certainly the coasts will be hit hard with rising sea level we will continue to experience stronger and stronger storms but overall the richest part of the world will adapt you know if if their food shortages", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily", "city":
