expected because of the very nature of this FDR report as Grassley and even Kavanaugh himself said during the confirmation hearings\nThe FBI doesn't reach conclusions it doesn't tell you whether somebody is guilty or not guilty so that means that senators reading this report have to draw their own conclusions and those conclusions will inevitably be political\nWell that's right but don't forget Michael there's still a handful of undecided senators who are looking at these interview reports to help make their decision about whether to vote yeah your name on judge Kavanaugh and those senators\nWill be the deciding factor in whether or not he gets a seat on the Supreme Court\nSo what about those senators who are on the fence what did they say when they see the FBI report\nOK so first let's talk about who they are there are three Republicans Senator Jeff flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and there are two Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia both in a very tough\nUh I Will be voting no one judge Kavanaugh said\nShe said that Christine lousy for testimony really echoed with her she found it very compelling and the weight on her\nYou know there's an old saying history will judge you but most importantly you judge yourself and that's really what I'm saying I Can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge Kavanaugh will\nAlso she said that she had questions about his truthfulness at the hearings and so she's going to be a no we still haven't heard from mansion and we haven't heard from Murkowski\nAnd we heard a little bit from flake and Collins or do they say well flakes when he wasn't ducking reporters said one short sentence there is no cooperation that was it and Collins came out of the Republican briefing and said\nIt seems to be a very thorough investigation I'm going to go back in and read these documents later and that's all I have to say\nAnd what do you make those brief comments from these swing senators\nWell in one sense we could construe them as comments of support right they didn't say anything negative but\nThey were both very careful about what they said so I think it's fair to say they signaled their satisfaction with the investigation but they didn't necessarily\nSay anything about how they would vote I think we still don't know how they're going to vote\nI Wonder to the degree that these undecided Republican senators may have always wanted to vote for Kavanaugh I Wonder if this report is designed to make it easier for them to do\nOh the Ford gave her very emotional account of alleged assault and they were locked in this he said she said and maybe that that was the point of having this report on the first place to make it easier for these undecided Republicans to do what they were always going to do\nNo I think that's right I think in a way that was kind of the brilliance of what Jeff Flake did Republicans were mad when he asked for the FBI to investigate they felt he was just delaying something they want to push this nomination through\nBut in the end by asking for this investigation lake may have just been giving coffers to himself and to recount skin Collins to vote yes if they end up doing that\n\n\nCheryl this entire investigation begins with Senator Flake and senator Coons asking\nFor it because they believed that this incredibly polarized and confirmation process has started to erode confidence in the Senate but also in the entire Supreme Court confirmation process and they believed that an investigation was the only way to begin to repair all that and to\nRestore confidence in the Senate and in the Supreme Court confirmation process I Wonder if you think the report ends up achieving any\nYou know I don't think it did Michael in honestly that's really awful thing about this\nIt it has been really brutal up here to see senators kind of shaken you know walking around the escorted by police [noise]\nKnow one senator who was confronted at home late at night\nThey were arriving back in town from their home state\nWide heard him and have to fear their whole fall fall aside\nThe mood here is very and [noise] and it's very angry [noise]\nYou know you're hearing from senators that we need to heal you know Jeff Flake said\nWhen he asked for this report\nThis just ripping the country apart and it's also ripping the Senate apart ... we're kind of back\nWhere we were a week ago except people are just angry or\n\n[noise] um [noise]\nIn the", "year": "2018",
