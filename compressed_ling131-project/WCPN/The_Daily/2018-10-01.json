quite know what is going on behind closed doors here's what was happening\nSenator Flake and senator Coons our friends they've known each other a long time they trust each other\nThey're the kind of friends in the Senate that are more genuine it's not just the my friend on the other side of the aisle\nSenator Flake says to senator Coons I'm having second thoughts I think your idea about a week delay to give the FBI time might actually be possible but I'm nervous she says and so what's\nAnd becomes much larger senator Coons goes out and get some of his Democratic colleagues come in and continue the conversation behind closed doors\nSenator Tom to list of North Carolina Senator John Cornyn of Texas to Republicans they also come in over the next forty five minutes or so you have virtually every member of the committee back in this small\nCramped hallway behind the committee room and what's happening is Senator Flake is essentially standing\nPretty much silence according to the people who describe the scene as he's surrounded on both sides by these two warring political\nFactions so the Republicans on the committee senator tell us into their corn and are arguing strenuously you can't do this this would be terrible it's going to throw the judge's wife even more Chris Coons and the Democrats are\nTrying to cope him along saying look you know this is what the Senate it's about it's about compromise it's about\nFinding a way forward without\nJamming something through for political purposes it got very heated as it was described to us and all of it with Senator Flake\nComing even more anxious was he going to reverse themselves and essentially put the brakes on what had seemed just moments before to be a foregone conclusion\nUm\nBe right back the

the concern of is this something that the FBI could even do is this something that would be valuable to the FBI do they have the resources to to have the wherewithal\nSo somebody suggests calling Christopher Wray the FBI Director they try they had they can't find Christopher Wray they can't reach him\nAnd so the second choice is to call Rod Rosenstein it comes down to you know a phone call\nWith the very man who the press and might yet firing was actively considering firing that's a phone call that obviously needs to be done with some privacy so Chris Coons and Jeff Flake\nCrammed themselves into one of these old fashioned kind of oversized phone booth closed the door took out a cell phone and essentially put it on speaker and called Rosenstein\nWe're told that Mr Rosenstein does reassure Senator Flake that the FBI can do an investigation though he does say that given the scope of it relatively short amount of time less than a week that it's unlikely to produce a lot more than senators already know but he says yes we can do that\nSo with this green light from Rosenstein what does Senator Flake do\nTwo of his Republican colleagues who are not\nMembers of the Senate Judiciary committee and that is Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska he called the two of them and basically said are you guys with me both assured send a flake that yes they would back him and that they would\nDemand the same thing a one week delay and an FBI investigation and armed with that Senator Flake went back into the committee room\nKnowing that the Senate Republicans and President Trump would have to relent because if they didn't they wouldn't have the votes ultimately to confirm judge Kavanaugh without the three Republicans [noise]\n\nAs a as a point of personal privilege I'm going to call on Senator Flake to speak ah normally we would start to vote right now but as a point of personal privilege I Would call on Senator Flake\nIt's interesting it all happens very quickly and even for a veteran watchers of the legislative sausage making process it was it was quite messy\nUm I I've been speaking with a number of people on the other side have conversations ongoing for a while a with regard to\nMaking sure that we do due diligence here Senator Flake announced his decision and I think it would be\nA proper to delay the for a vote or for up to but not more than one week\nHe said that he had changed his mind and then now believed that he would be willing to vote for judge Kavanaugh's nomination to move forward from the committee to the full Senate but only with the assurance that this one week to lay would happen\nSo that's without agreements or I won't go to a tax bill to for a\nAnd started to try to ask some questions to clarify exactly what that meant and what their strengths as they would have that it would happen\nWhen every voting on that say we are voting on a motion to report the nomination to the floor\nSenator Grassley quickly said circle calls her role clicked photos emotion\nThe person who calls the role started calling senators names they started saying yes yes\nYes so in the Republican side\nBy as promised Senator Flake vote yes\nOn and on a nice\nDemocrats kind of weren't quite certain I think in some cases what was happening they all voted no and before you knew it\nGovernment like the two are all we're germ\n\nAmateur Grassley had gaveled down and said the ayes have it judge Kavanaugh's nomination has been kind of approved by the committee and forwarded to the full Senate\nThere's the confusion a little bit about whether it all men and as the senators are leaving Senator Lindsey Graham is overheard by some reporters\nSaying somebody's got his plane as the Trump so I guess that it may not young [laughter]\n\nLike what do you make of what Jeff Flake in on friday I Can't help thinking back to what you said about him when we first started talking he's sort of despondent\nAt the state of the divided country he's distraught over the state of the U.S Senate he's in his final weeks as an office and he's going to be out of office in just a couple of months and then this moment is\nIs that he wasn't at peace with the initial decision you could sort of see that in his face even before all of the kind of machinations behind the scenes took place you could see looking at him that he didn't look at peace it's unclear to me whether it will turn out\nThat Senator Flake will go down in history you know\nFeeling like this is the sort of most heroes moment in his Senate career because I think we don't know\nWhat the outcome of the FBI investigation is whether people will see it as legitimate and so I don't know what he will think about this in the end but at least for the moment you could see on his face at the end of that hearing after he had successfully engineered\nThis FBI inquiry to take place you could see a kind of late this in his\nFace that however it finally comes out that he felt like this was the right thing to do [noise]\nUm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "01"}
