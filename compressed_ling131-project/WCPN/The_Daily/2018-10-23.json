President Trump's visit to Riyadh in fact up till now the Saudis have bought only about\nFourteen and a half billion of that hundred ten billion so this huge upside that the Trump Administration was promising has yet to materialize\n[noise]\nSo how is President Trump who has a bet on him as the western friendly reformer responding to these disappointing turns in this\nIs I have great confidence from king Solomon and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia they know exactly what they are doing some of those very harshly treating have been milking their country for years what's\nThe White House put out a lengthy statement after the incident with the wealthy Saudis being locked up in the Ritz Carlton in which he effectively endorsed the prince and said he believed in what he was trying to do to clean up his kingdom he has not publicly chided him for the war in Yemen\nHe did ask him to try to resolve the dispute with cutter but when the Saudis basically defied him and continued with the blockade of cutter President Trump went quiet the Trump Administration seems willing to let the prince have plenty of leeway why\nWould that be though you said earlier that\nThe reason President Trump has that on and the U.S is that he provides the justification for the relationship he is the best possible face for all the flaws in messiness of the Saudi Arabian United States alliance\nBut in these actions he seems to be emerging as a figure that would embarrass the United states so why would President Trump not attempt to exercise greater influence over his hand picked leader of Saudi Arabia\nAfter this series of events\nThink President Trump would argue that\nMohammed bin Salman needs the opportunity to establish himself to consolidate power\nHe's operating in a tough part of the world but above all I think the case he would make is that on the ultimate strategic issue of combating Iran which is the centerpiece of President Trump's Middle East strategy\nMohammed bin Salman is a critical player member in Yemen Saudi Arabia is fighting the who\nThat Saudi Arabia support and so to the extent that Iran is really the big prize for President Trump Mohammed bin Salman is his wing man in that effort\n... so what's the message that this inaction by President Trump sends to momma didn't Solomon if he knows that so long as Iran is being taken care of everything else will more or less be forgiven\nWill the messages that he has a free hand to do whatever he wants and that is above all the message that NBS has taken for the last twelve months\n\nAnd that brings us to October

dot com\n[noise]\nTo Mars lander from everything you've told us so far President Trump would seem very reluctant to intervene here against Saudi Arabia even over an incident as grotesque and horrifying as this one so\nHow does the president respond in the immediate aftermath of\nSo his immediate inclination is to give mum had been Solomon and the Saudis the benefit of the doubt he says\nI saw the Saudi Arabia I just\nGot off the phone with the king with the prince cicadas\nFirmly denied any knowledge of it you didn't really know maybe I don't want to get it\nHad nothing to do with it later he acknowledges well\nTo be very severe fed fed up but we'll see what happens if\nThis is true it would be serious there might be serious consequences and then he switches yet again and\nSays well the intelligence I'm getting on this seems pretty persuasive and we now know that that intelligence makes it very strong if circumstantial case that very senior people in the Saudi royal court ordered this killing so the president goes through the evolution of reactions\nRight up until we see him Maggie Haberman Michael Schmidt of myself\nGo in to see him in the oval office last Thursday\nAnd he's extremely circumspect on the case he clearly knows a great deal now about what happened in that conflict but he stopped short of saying that he thinks Mohammed bin Salman could have played a role in it but he does also acknowledge\nThis is a moment that has captured the imagination of the world unfortunately so in that last word unfortunately you sense for him to personal steaks\nAnd so I Do think he recognizes that he's puzzling through it he doesn't seem to have an easy answer and he sees it as a situation replete with risk\nYou almost sense of the president wishes that the world wouldn't pay so much attention to this as they hadn't these past episodes relating to Saudi Arabia that he would have preferred\nFor everyone to have kind of swept to this one under the rug and maintain the image of NBS as a reform minded leader\nI think that's right I think that President Trump views this incident less as a human rights atrocities less if something he needs to stand against then as a public relations problem he sees it as fundamentally something that is tarnish the image of his ally\nInstead of it make that impossible sadly the victims of the air strikes in Yemen are for the most part invisible to the west I think everyone can visualize the idea of a man walking into a conflict\nAnd being caught up with a bone saw there's something so visceral and dramatic and horrifying about that image that I think that\nHas made it much harder for President Trump to simply wish it away this is not going to be wished away it's simply too appalling for people that it can be dismissed that easily\n... so that kind of cover story of NBS as a reformer was blown by the absolute horrific this of this particular act in a way that even a massive military intervention in Yemen couldn't achieve I think the\nIncredible drama of it had the effect if you will of ripping the mask off suddenly Mohammed bin Salman or at least Mohammed bin ... regime is revealed to be
