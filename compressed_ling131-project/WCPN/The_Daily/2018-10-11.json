rivalry a complicated regional relationship with Saudi Arabia so is there any reason to be skeptical of this account being made for what happened inside the Saudi constantly\nYeah of course we should be skeptical and intelligence officials or security officials and diplomat we know are often careless with the truth so we have two oldest check but one of the most compelling officers to that is where is Jemma crush again he didn't turn up it didn't come\nStory and now that they are releasing the details of the Saudis who flew in that day and journalists are already being able to corroborate the movement of these private jets that came in and left again\nSo we're all piecing it together but the fundamental question remains is where is Jamal ... and the Saudis don't have an answer to that\nCaller you told us that Mohammed than Solomon has been determined to portray himself as a reformer to the west to somebody who's trying to open up Saudi Arabia and bring it in line with the western world\nIt feels like this alleged murder of democracy Yogi if it's proven that Saudi Arabia was behind it it would seem like an almost willfully reckless reinforcement of the darker reputation of Mohammed bin Salman in a way that would very much\nTarnish his reputation all over the west so why would he ever do it\n[noise] I mean yes you're completely right it looks like a dog ... unbalanced reaction that an excessive weight to silence of course it who was important and valuable but\nCritic he's not an enemy but I think you have to then also always remember that lesson of understanding the middle east or other foreign countries in there in time and the way I read it is someone like Mohammed bin Salman is still consolidating his power\nBut also showing his enemies or his rivals what he's made of and in fact they've done quite over action\nNot covering that tracks very much so they were showing that they were leaving a signal and therefore I think sending a direct message to other exiled other critics but also to the Turkish government\nMaybe misguided but I think he intended to send a message of great strength and great cruelty\nBut the risk that was taken here is that it tests the tolerance of that country turkey and the rest of the entire world that cares about the question of sovereignty and so I Wonder what those countries what are they willing to tolerate from Saudi Arabia right\nNow turkey is acting actually quite cautiously\nThey're releasing all this information because they want to support in the way behind them\nSo I think that shows you the power of Saudi Arabia countries a careful not\nTo upset them because of that wealth and power and they're important in the middle east and I think for some government they become deeply involved in backing Mohammed bin Salman his reforms and not least the administration of President Trump was asked to\nJust you know I wouldn't be certainly conservative actually have a whole image to his wife his wife wrote us say let her a\nAnd aggressive to my wife and myself and we're in contact with her now and we want to bring it to the White House 'cause it's very sad situation it's very sad situation and we want to get to the bottom of it and what has\nBeen the reaction so far from the way it's been muted so I think there is horror story written to if you notice the politicians have been slow and I'm not saying too much\nI don't want to make I don't want to say that I always not\nWill have to find out who did it but uh\n[noise] people so I'm going to but they didn't see him come out as they understand it and we're going to take\nYeah I think if this was a smaller\nLess important country we would've had dinner and fish and much more rapidly ...\nI Would have thought the public outrage at this story and the horror or I mean it's really a horror movie\nThat we are now I'm standing unfolded in this quiet nice the streets of stumble I think that might still carry a lot of weight with politicians I think they're going to have to hold prince\nMohammed bin sell them on a um slang for a while for just that\nIt's awesome inside had rather than us it was but it or you know I left the highest level let's say let me say this it's the highest level\nThe ... you mentioned they sat for those who had more than once but I think\nWe would also see some cash full diplomatic phrasing was even\nI Do
