Massachusetts\nOkay okay I grew up in Massachusetts I've identified as the New Yorker\nAnd in fact I Know both the candy it's for that and ... there are ... and so as Massachusetts yeah basically you know they let me you know this is the ... well I don't know if it was a ... or something but there was one that had Idaho have a Nettie light as the favorite candidate [laughter]\nDaddy like\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy uh movies yes was difficulty romantic comedies yeah um I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up on each other\nAgain and we need to miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girl private love letters from mysteriously mailed to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you\nThink I have golden spent my eyes\nTo let us around [noise] then there was this\nOther one where the bride that left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her estranged father\nTo lift that credibly drunk that night and I blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what the grammar and hunting for the fun thing about all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved before and\nSo good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely\nFeel retro about that I feel I feel like\nIt stokes a particular part of my heart same same so these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get the scribe has to watch them and the comedies on the streaming service\nThey even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is when I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I have been kind of\n... out for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer\nI Know you didn't even now [noise] um they\nCalled it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer\nA that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so in theory or to me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching these rom coms my big question in first question about all of this is like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen\nSo knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will just might work for us\nI think they just spied a completely under served market you know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book club shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up\nAt the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only\nAre churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used and\nIt's worked out really well for them yeah why\nHave the big movie studios at the movies in theaters why after all gums\nWrit large I think they're ah they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars bat\nGym with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put your ground with anybody like let's move on to build up next why not\n[noise] but then you have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and the tank and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be a kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free\nAnd again like it's not a big deal but then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms honor and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars in your lovely ... end up together rubber on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with the Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going out to\nUm should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more wrong comes in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because I mean crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and in the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters and because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like we're depressed were\nYou know we're stressed out we want escapism we want you know we want like just an easy fun movie maybe we don't even want to see things one up anymore I Know that's hard to even like ... out of your head around\nBut we know like an actual romance yeah like my husband and I had a a drag out fight last night over like whether the kitchen regulars to slippery and like an effective like decorative motif or our kitchen or was it a health hazard\n[noise]\nYou're listening to it's been a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders and wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids we've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show me do in politics me too\nAnd the dozens of stories we've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people that should be able to trust\nThe reality is causing a great deal of physical mental and emotional pain he never healed me he took advantage of ... and our dreams you\nThat's Olympics gold medalists alley Raisman she was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar he was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job for less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater ... barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and\nSo he helps drive I came in and I went from practice which both of our families really appreciate it and so and he would only pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rank and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rain can skate and there was ... when that happened before and after I mean in the parking lots for high school parking lot\nFriday was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year old Atlantic medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brightest mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first then I mean I can picture Clare state back\nThat same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end which in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took office he found he turned to me and he said can I guess you\nWould have had a minimum I said nothing I just sat there [noise] um I\nWill sit here and honestly say I did I say no I did not open the door and not run away but I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's free and that's what happened and\nI remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car out and I remember just being like a fog or a I mean now now we have an especially I was like W. A. T. S. [laughter] yeah you know and right shock probably a tundra present\nAnd only ... how would I tell\nAnyone who would believe me what proof to have\nWhy would anyone\nBelieves that he would do you know I mean just [noise] um and it wasn't violet in what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan you know all that\nThat we pretend to make these people will be so yeah that would be an honest to God that is the day my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in the ... the the\nContact become more intense but yeah so so people will say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to answer that\nAwkward question on any I never\nHad sex and the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms\nAnd you are touched and follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taken advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time\nI'm very much so so uh\nHe ... he had um a growing issue skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that and my mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom\nOh my goodness yeah so how are you in your house for now wasn't from your mother you knew what he was doing to you she did not know how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean I think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and I was so dedicated who wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have\nAny anything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing that he wanted for me was my ... slot body\nUm and um and what it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me and he took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming\nAmir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there is something they're not straight they're bent to go left and the offset\nSo I'm as you're getting better that all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight Olympic trials surgical winner club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training program sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a fulltime job and a family\nUm he Andy took care of my blades and I mean our coach Andy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to a skating\nSigned a ride to the rank and Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen but he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else that could be yeah yeah because he was crying\nTo me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean so things that seems silly and\nTo someone like just stop for a second I I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I was mowing lawns and the summer\nThat's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute [laughter] it's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen\nWith other Fifteen year old kids you're right but\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is gray\nState lived down the street from Andy one block away and and he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go on after party I can go to anything I had to come directly home\nSo I told the group of friends I was dying with than my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing going to go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured that it fine but it was because he was controlling yeah when I told my parents finally picked me up you know the station ... station wagon\nA rolling by school parking lot to pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those memories in my brain of being in my bedroom had twin beds in my bedroom and this yellow\nBedside table between the two of them in this phone was there and I remember being kind of under the covers so no one could hear me picking up the phone dialing his phone number and being like I Am home\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR I'm Sam Sanders and I'm Talking with elite speed skater Brady fear about being sexually abused by her mentor", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "28"}
