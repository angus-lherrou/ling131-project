I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band Sicilia plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nI work both hiding in a corner on your band [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys know right where did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school and shirts for too you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond\nFind find thoughts of my days hiding in the corner we\nActually played at ... at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah sodium story there are couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\n... plus I just want the opportunity to win together or we didn't have to work together but I mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally we did it\nSo you want it to run on the homecoming court as a keen but at the school administration told her that only boys can be canes and only girls can be queens\nCecilia and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day\nThey decided to have no gender titles in the home coming contests no ... no queens everyone on homecoming court would just be known as quote royals\nBut that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples story how do you feel about this\nThink they were over compensating rather than just your day and that well it shouldn't have that\nThey were now that the king\nQueen or anything in between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school to say we're going to take out come on circuit check out check against what couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the change the sodium story happened dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't what home coming to post ... about um outside\nOf Austin people that are hearing about it a common cause they're not very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat are mostly basically saying that we're at work network snowflakes rational special treat them and that that is exactly what they would have expected to elect thing and that's how far is that they were drilling homecoming perfect yeah\nPeople really think there's going to ruin homecoming live with and without taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well is there going to be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next\nHi yes actually that's one of the teachers that has been talking to us throughout this whole issue mentioned like offhand ... she was but and I can't wait for which we get the problem\nIs the age [laughter]\nYeah please [noise]\n\nIt'd be street on one of the story and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support them others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made\nMe think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have this woman is ration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some people\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older and I'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and\nI mean we could have been having the same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like\nThey're trying to be supportive why aren't they okay with just being known as friends why why why do we need to talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and\nThat they're together like that's like talking about their sex lives there has have always been these issues about how we use language and what it means and the fact is that older people have often been confused about how younger people want to use that link\nFamily
