at some big moment in coming out history and hearing coming out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor and university\nAnd about this one big moment yeah it was a big deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll her a lot that's Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on ABC sitcoms\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThat's right [noise]\n\nI remember this year I was like Thirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch what I knew that I shouldn't watch wow that make the ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter] oh God I never had old I remember right\nExactly and it's not like I'm looking for protection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with and obviously you didn't click with Richard has there ever been any one use silk you click with\nAnd what was his name Susan [noise]\nThey both for younger people [laughter]\nI don't know I guess I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen no normal\nMean just the same thing everybody wants to my house the picket fence you know a dog or cat Sunday barbecues someone you love someone who loves me someone I can build a life with just I just want to be happy\nAnd you think you can have these things with a woman well society has a pretty big problem with it you know\nNone of the backlash that she face was pretty ... lost his show obvious conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show ABC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and um snow in April in Nineteen Ninety seven\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear it\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the gay characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there's no right and wrong in this issue of the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible digging wow\nWow [noise] it's so funny she says there's an agenda to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah they mail is following\nWhole hate kids it's okay you can try to um it was fascinating to hear it 'cause that's of course what they were terrified about that it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um [noise]\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly and can I jump and I know we're going decade by decade I'll do it go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it\nI'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post\nReally of protest when he says don't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out\nIn the ... gone from Nineteen Ninety seven Ellen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later we don't do it academic saying don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay\nSo for one and this is debatable\nAmerica this is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen he on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nI'm paraphrasing ... you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it but they don't wear as head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out for no one should\nMaybe heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people and that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know ... do you think an R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never use the word gay right you know do you think about Jodie Foster Amos the kind of came out [laughter] Globes we actually have tape\nOf that but I'm just going to put it out there right loud and proud right so I'm I'm In Egypt support on [noise]\nI Am a\nYes I\nThink\nI already did like on the out about ... years ago back in the stone age\n[noise]\nTo everyone who knew her everyone's actually\nLike barely I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life without press conference a fragrance at a friend's I'm [noise]\nI have a point in my life and have a point should we be forced should anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be the coming out yeah and\nSee this is where we go back to it being both a personal any political choice\nAnd I think the personal has to come first and I think that you know you and I know the the list the celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know about\nYou and you really want to come out and who flirt with it much like foster did um and then for whatever reasons whether it's familiar will\nUm whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know they decide not to or they don't yet or they wait or whatever and I think I think there's got to be room for that too I Do I care more about whether people get in the way of social change or aged\nSomebody is down with the struggle if they are helping the movement however they want to do it whether it's overt or covert and [noise] I think the choice of whether they command is up to them [noise]\nBlue\nBanks again to Marcy Gallo professor in University of Nevada Las Vegas you're listening to it benefited from NPR News

S. dot ORG you're listening to it's\nBeen a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders this past Thursday October eleventh was a dirty national coming out day mark that day we are exploring coming out I was never just one day and\nHow it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with e Patrick Johnson you the head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people brown people and there's people whoever\nWhere you live a gay life\nBut you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day where you tell everyone hopes no and and and like other folks don't [laughter] this feels to me\nTo be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white America saying yes yeah and yeah and if you are already\nHailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your right to a a a black person I like the next person an Asian person\nAnd that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have\nAny choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it and I especially feel that way I'm for African Americans in particular because of the connection to the church mhm you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and\nNot find a game in ... a whole ... of them\nWhere I feel I came into my head out\nOf work I mean I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit\n... there was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there yeah I mean the church is where I was encouraged to um\nExpress myself which I was a big old clean love 'em and and the choirs than\nA singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos section and I'm sure that ended up I'm sure they loved it they should be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you're saying yeah well not in my church that I thought okay [laughter]\nBut many charges were doing but many are absolute and still do and ... and so yeah it it's a really a\nConcert a weird place yeah no but that's that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low yeah phenomena and also we should stop to define what the downloads for those who might not know\nHe has so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend a fight as gay\nAnd they're usually black they only allowed to jail for men other than black men\nYes I'm even though that's not true\n[laughter] well I mean like ... for white man they yeah but they were living in a life you know yeah the lead a double life yeah why does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey Milk\nIn the seventies coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time this subset of the community black man is still being labeled with this term deal so at the same time\nWe being very open in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of a black and Latino connects lesbians [noise]\nWe're open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing of pushing back against the second wave feminist movement\nWas white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lord a ... Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these black lesbians yeah and like you know lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on ... riots there another listener who shared a coming out story with us on a twenty five from Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago and he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but on the has the second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nWas in college and I in one of my classes um my professor I'd brought in a trench she was a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story guys like to be only strong and like you know soft and [noise]\nUm and I always felt like something was wrong but like I said it was like in the military and\nThat's nice house and really like think\nAbout who I Am\nLike kept back in my chair and as I always did in class and I'm just kinda mulling over another like giving yourself the space to ask yourself [noise] never done that before interesting and so they pose myself that question I was like\nOkay well I Am I on it and like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because I think the answer was no ...\n\nOn a recently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy ice parents got really hung up on that\nThey kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an aesthetic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't like being ... I have I and everybody just like things about their body but we still owe like make our way through life and we just have to learn to love ourself and it was like well\nThere's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body part and like\nI don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I kind of made it clear that like it doesn't\nMatter if you understand or not but like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and that was something like that\nYeah the other day and\nWe'd like set a good night's than as going after that and my dad called out I after me and say like well again tonight and thanks for being yourself\n\nI mean maybe they'll never really under stand in that but\nI'm Still their cat and um yeah and we still let me tell you\nThe story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Elon did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to like Janelle Monet a is an example\nBecause she didn't come out as gay or it was something much more fluid and I think we're in a moment of trans and this\nAnd gender non conforming aid that is really influencing how people announced their sexuality and so it's much more ... than a I'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like well I'm not heterosexual\n[laughter] yeah well and like she said that she opened me was I think pan sexual and it's just a guy from time to time than people that are not going to form your own time and I also think in the same vein of someone like Frank Ocean who kind of came out but in actuality never ever used the word gay\nCorrect because it's I think in the moment we're in now it's not about limiting oneself to an identity", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "14"}
