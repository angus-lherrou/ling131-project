few how the CGI of hooks to hit that mark\nWith countries build as dreams from Nineteen sixty\nThat's on Ninety point trees here is now\nBetween the Santa Claus [noise]\nThis is hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam we start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to get [noise] which is about [noise]\nThe schools with stress [noise]\nPatriotism and respect\nIt would be a very rules base uh educational system\nHouse this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully bringing in mode or the town of the class with lots of churches that's down one here in town to\nThe schools would be based more on stereotypes are all kinds of things rather than than real memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to that so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal bill and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward\nExplanation we use our upbringing and life experiences as the basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers and friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national\nSecurity but what if I told you there's something deeper into those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\n\nAt a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon article with me\nHow science proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter let's say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscures something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals\nIt would be with you when most of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that theory go well [noise]\nWhenever asked my students where their political views come from the first thing I say their parents\nAnd I think we have the sense that those views that our parents have passed along or supplemented by those you know from a clergy member a trusted relative a close friend\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's really at the core of of who we are not the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only makes sense is if they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\n\nThere are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual of a political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted\nA ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe have people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conduct ... which is a common way of seeing if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of him and just because they're they have some emotional content\nBut we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative\nThat is true that have been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a pictures of mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all out would look at was the brain scan results and we could be\nIncredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to some out of sensory too\nAnd this is part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I Can't even the ... century too with the active but it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rusty now goes right through there but you're still matter sensory too it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have\nWhen they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics and the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment I think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin parents raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies\nNow if you find differences between identical twins as it grew at fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is the driver\nI asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWere fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves how long ago it's fairly dated data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a find that\nThirty or forty percent of our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science that many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a loser link in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you\nThat there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all of this war besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have which fresh inside\nA and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this was long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to write with his right hand\nThis is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do\nA then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather were oriented to the world and a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this is the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath a deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats\nAnd think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise] I'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to you for bait on but it's basically that\nA division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of the innovation is very old and a structure the world since time began [noise]\n\nHitting as a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln here spent years studying the psychological newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives along with\nFrancis John thanks for joining me today on hidden brain thank you Shankar it was a pleasure to be with you [noise]\nSlavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just to sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of\nHow our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness and the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah at that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of value all ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nThink that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much\nThere's only so far you're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family rights of family we have every family people fight the world they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love\nJury the bonds of that democracy what tested again when we come back the political upheaval of the Nineteen sixties and there are echoes today [noise]

have been completely unfair to deny it\nOf allegations that are completely unsubstantiated he he's caught some flak for this this is this is crossing a big line throwing something like that out there is almost like McCarthy you know I have a list\nA so he's drilling down yesterday um his last night his office or the the ... a lawyer that has been a business partner ... who who was met with one of these women released along statements saying I'm not going to tell you who she is I'm not going to tell you when this happened but here's here's the awful stuff that happened to her and she's\nCredible um it's just it's surprising a shared brown has come back with fury it's got to be a little bit yeah I mean hey you know they sent a cease and desist letter they say it's a libel is and and I think you're right I think tomorrow night there's going to be fireworks\nI this is hard to understand because ... is headed by all by all the parents is to a pretty big laws and if you want to have a a a political future\n... unless you're you want to go this way but one of the uh one of our members of our politics team and an interesting theory yesterday's we're talking about this you know he thought\nSharon Brown and presents a legitimate threat to Donald Trump in twenty twenty because he'd long has represented the Trump voter if he comes out of Ohio ... out of this race with a ten point lead in a state that Donald Trump won by eight points he's a threat\nSo it would it be possible than Republicans ... said Jim you're going to get killed do us a favor muddy him up as you've been down so that the Democrats are lows to put him on the ballot we don't want to face him and twenty twenty that makes some sense you know you don't know but but but it doesn't make a lot of sense for him to doing\nTo be doing what he's doing it's backfiring\nRenee playing pit bull not for this year but for two years from\nHis doing a favor and then you know maybe does get a job in the ministry ...\nOr something who knows the response from abroad campaign spokesman is the official congressman or an atheist both pathetic an irresponsible she'll to this is not the first time he's attacked this way\nNow I mean let's face\nBrown is from middle candidate Republicans will tell you that at least privately they'll say you know this is a guy who loves going to chicken dinners this is a guy who understands the Ohio swing voters and has kept them reliably in the in his corner\nWhether this would be enough to turn the racy campaign I don't see anybody seeing it that way at least what's out there now but but I think I think you're absolutely right Chris that this is the kind of thing that just adds a little bit of an ... factor to somebody it comes back down the road\nAnd they would have been seeing a lot of ads up here I assume you assume their state wide race I'm Renee seeing me to launching statewide ads last friday calling attention to Brahms thirty year old goat divorce this was before the new allegations this has gotten muddy fast and steady now\n[noise] yeah and I I think a couple of things to keep in mind if you look at the one of the biggest driving factors of Republican or consider conservative enthusiasm has been the Kavanaugh hearings uh because it's sort of\nRallied up support among conservative voters that they want to see somebody or they want to see conservative judges on the Supreme Court and with the allegations that came up against Kavanaugh I think that race is trying to make some sort of equivalency here but a\nChristian ... right it it just it doesn't make any sense to say that\nKavanaugh was up falsely accused oh but wait a minute here are here's an accusation I'm going to throw Sherrod Brown's way and I think I think it's sort of a misunderstanding of what the me too movement is and the first place\nI reached out to the national me too movement and they said of course they have no affiliation with the with the me too Ohio group that's been putting out these ads against Sherrod Brown\nBut they say that the whole point of the me too movement is to give a voice to victims because victims have come forward in the past\nAnd nobody listens to them in this case there are no victims coming forward there's a person of a person of a person who says they talked to a victim\nI have no problem with shared I'm I'm Still good friends with them I still campaign for him we have grandchildren together so it's sort of seems like a misinterpretation of of what the me too movement is all about in the first place\nAnd look this is so unsubstantiated but it's caused people in newsrooms to debate whether it's a story that we debated this to Russia so and and and ultimately I think people are deciding look he's a Republican candidate for Senate\nThe fact that he's doing something like this that many refining to be pretty despicable is news and so you have to report it but but it's a debate because you know just by reporting it does it solve\nDoes it serve the purpose of muddying up Sherrod Brown after this election\nOr we own agreement that this is probably going to hit something tomorrow during the debate [laughter] if there is that if there if there is a debate okay good point is it to counter the charges from Renee the yesterday we also learned that inquiry into his using a Cleveland businessmen airplane for campaign trip without properly reporting the cost of those flights what's up\nThere well this is a follow up to the stories he got on the streets came out a couple of weeks ago that he had used the um the strip club owners playing for for flights in his son it just makes it more or less that's\nRight and that's why everybody talking about it I'm a national had his campaign but it turns out he use\nThat a bunch during his original campaign for governor on his response is is that he paid that out of his pocket that he didn't pay out of his campaign fund and that that's completely legal although he hasn't provided anything overseas to back that up and\n'em polls haven't budged in weeks when they see the allegations are as the Cincinnati Enquirer wrote a Hail Mary pass thrown by a fifth string JV quarterback\nAny chance that for all the answers flow of\nThe better line I'm Henry Gomez tuition fees that that um he's a ed Fitzgerald with a driver's license [laughter] wow okay\nOh most from the middle where neighborhood sued the city this week this follows the September rejection of legislation that would have legalized you get mugged by reading a zoning change ... through the goal is to get through the whole to waterlogged homes to stay on the property\nYeah I'm In St Louis to has opened this up back in twenty sixteen when the city cleared some people who were in informal gathering sleeping under bridges et cetera\nHe opens his property behind his business or saying I don't want people to stay here forever but this is one and a continuum that we need to offer to get people off\nThe street and they already have service was ... out of the fence was the new\nRight right and the services are in his building their washing machines some counseling things like that he says at least these people are all in one place where the services can get to where we can reach them we can get them into treatment\nAnd the city I understood the argument and it understood that this is an\n... situation for the city that that this lodging homeless people is not where it wants to be but it went through months and months of trying to figure something out of turn down his own change request it did say we will put our services behind finding these people are there places to live\nWith those people didn't necessarily want to go forward into the system\nThey didn't they didn't um but as with a lot of these things is that he's trying to balance these people's rights are right behind it is a senior citizens lower income senior citizens\nApartment building and the people living there say you know I wake up in the morning to the dirt and the smells and you know people setting fires things like that saves lives as well we got control of that now it's ... it's like a lot of things there's so much gray in there\nAnd the city I think they did negotiate um St Louis is not necessarily in good faith but this is where this ended up\nThe city also says they don't want to do harm by putting people back on the streets\nThat's in homeless shelters as they are some of these folks say we don't want to be in those homeless shelters or we wouldn't qualify for the homeless shelters because we don't pledge certain things I'm certain behaviors\nHundred dollars but there's a lot of money coming in for Danny O'Connor campaign and that's that's the biggest reason why he's been able to keep his campaign of flow in a district that usually goes very heavy towards Republicans and the double digits\nDo we expect to be as close this time around as it was a six weeks ago eight weeks ago\nYeah I think it's hard to tell the you got to remember that in August it was a special election so you have to ask herself\nWho's turning out for a special election in the first place\nWhere the Democrats able to get a bigger turnout than usual where the Republicans not able to get as big of a turnout because maybe that's an older generation of of voters who know about the November elections but don't really pay close attention to the special election so it altered it all comes down to who\nIs turning out which bloc of voters so it's still up in the air at this point remember boulders didn't one very narrowly\nA president Donald Trump came into Delaware county a very red\nCounty to sort of pumping some enthusiasm among voters just days before the election and a lot of people think that that\nHelped ... case so it'll be interesting to see\nHow many people are still enthusiastic about coming out again to vote for ...\n... I think that enthusiasm is going to remain consistent on the Democratic side because people who might describe themselves as either democratic voters liberal voters or anti Donald Trump voters those people are going to come out again anyway so it all depends on on who's getting the turn out\nA lot of the races in Ohio for Congress or not that close this one getting a lot of retention bonus than your eyes on income but now but I'm confident of two months so really we have to think about how much impact this was this one race could out\nAnd look it's the general election with a whole lot of races on the ballot serves and he puts out in a special election you get a very different kind of crowd and it depends on who turns out that people do show up for Cordray because that's close does that swing\nBeat them handling the harbor Gibbs race of is looking at that and Harbaugh Ken Harbaugh has raised to point two million to Gibbs about a million which is a taught him in Russia yeah and and Betsy Rader uh Dave Joyce raise Dave joy still has the overall advantage but she's really picked up the fundraising in this last quarter\nA lot of this money is coming from out of state though and there's always the question of how much do folks on the coast now about Ohio and Ohio politics and is this money that's got more on hope than on a reality especially based on the way Ohio's map is drawn up being able to swing these districts\nIt it has scared Republicans in water or largely thought to be Republican districts have Joyce's kinda running away from Donald Trump which a lot of Republicans aren't doing because Betsy Rader is resonating with a lot of people out there now you drive through there is you see a ton of raiders signs out they're far more\nAnd last year or ... or two years ago the author of Trump's on\nThe other the other thing is the Democrats have absolutely landed on health care as a huge issue which go back to ... to twenty ten and it was like\nI was leaving whether a but they they have said you know this this idea that pre existing conditions could be under attack as well as having affordable health care is just we that's a winning issue for\nUs okay we got there while air one of the two airlines currently offering flights to Iceland from Cleveland Hopkins airport ending in service after only five months its competitor Iceland there which also started offering flights out of Cleveland this year will continue to operate but not back until may\nSo Cleveland Hopkins airport officials say well didn't meet its load factor goals the airlines are but if you were lower than expected the airline also ending service out of Cincinnati an out of St Louis as well Christmas is indicative of a problematic issues with Cleveland's market or is this just while making a decision as a company\nWell it sounds like wow in life and they're both having some financial issues with the rapid ...\nThousand dollars a year for two years from the airport and the greater Clinton partnership kicked in even more there was never\nReleased and even with those subsidies they decided they couldn't make it this has happened very quickly I mean well originally announced it would it would restart later than normal and then said we're out and then just yesterday I Believe were excellent there\nCame back and said yeah we're not going to come back in March we're going to come back in may and people had hoped to the the disappearance of Lao would cause Iceland dare to expand its not about the clue to market it really is I that that they took on\nToo much of a low but wow what a difference of maybe last year everybody wanted to go to Iceland and it seemed like in August everybody in Cleveland was in Iceland\nWhat does this mean for international travelers though because a lot of people were using it not to go to Iceland but to connect and Reykjavik\nAnd that means that means there's going to be more difficulties and flying from Cleveland again without direct service to Europe\nWhile we're talking airport Cleveland city council closed implementing a four dollar taxi fee for vehicles service in Cleveland Hopkins airport does all of that go to the airlines as that help defray their costs\nIn Cleveland has among the highest landing fees for lines in the country and they keep trying to find other sources of revenue\nOut there so that they can reduce that that's why they did all the shops and things out there and there's also a fairness issue here that that there's there these guys aren't paying that kind of of the um and others are paying fees to one another and this is an effort to try and balance that it's been very controversial\nYeah so the four hours for taxes that also apply to the black limos to lifted it over to everybody\nWas some of those were already paying it and so this is to to equalize things out\nThere and boosted as well yeah okay thanks\nWell despite the lower than expected numbers for awhile air tourism to Cleveland is yet another record greater Cleveland attracted Eighteen and a half million visitors and twenty seven seen as a to point three percent increase over twenty sixteen the growth is better than Ohio's overall visitor grow it also marks the eight year that does it or growth outpaced\nWell that the goalie Centers for twenty twenty and they need to increase by five hundred thousand a year for the next three years to do it but look if you look back to ten years ago I mean we're five million head of that um you gotta tip the half a destination clear they really have\nFigured out how to market this city around the world I you know help to have around here you know 'cause every time he played in on national TV people sing beautiful pictures of Cleveland um the RMC was another another thing but I ... it's surprising that they keep out pacing the country David Gilbert had a\nDestination Clinton said that we can't keep doing this forever to to beat sixteen and Seventeen is actually rally really rather remarkable friday we didn't we didn't have signature events but\nBut if you look at the way they change their marketing of Cleveland had and they are and see and the science they put into it\nIt it it's been a remarkable success story and you don't think replacing the bronco at the rally possum label have little brown man the browser breaking down and say how do they measure these numbers anyway it's just based on who stay in hotels\nThat well it's it's people are coming in for the ... miles away and they use a lot of hotel data and ... you know the thing that is what you can also always complain about how how these things are put together but if you do I'm the same way year after year after year you can measure the rate of change and there's no denying that rate of change here\nAnd when we talk about Cleveland outpacing Ohio but Columbus and Cincinnati aren't doing badly either no good numbers there look Columbus is\nThe Ohio juggernaut right now there was a conference in Boston um earlier [noise] um I think this month in which they're talking about cities that are doing everything right and Columbus was the talk of that conference\nAnd he smiled when he called you a drug or not is there a good feeling there right now the Columbus is definitely the star on the rise\nTo Columbus yeah I I mean that that I it it it was funny at this\nSeen a huge influx of small businesses popping up different independently owned businesses where they create you know craft\nDruze different a different styles different uh clothing attire things so you just see a lot of small businesses popping up here and they're all thriving\nIt doesn't hurt to be the company's story there Columbus has city government in Ohio State\nThey may have been up there to say the state schools to government and insurance companies nationwide\nBut they did get together ... years ago and say what do we have to do to become a signature city and you're seeing the results with it\nAnd one of the things they did we talk about sports here and what it means is having the soccer team in the hockey team didn't hurt them either so it's it's certainly blooming and Columbus thanks\nWell this month sue mouth the Ghana search out there for a partnership or merger with any other health system Akron base hospital system looking for long term financial stability it's struggle financially in the past we've reported that recording the cranes Cleveland business experts expect so Mel through attract\nInterest from regional state and national players children how could this affect Akron oh could affect that region\nWell cliff devotees talked yesterday to the Akron round table to reassure them that ... gets what it means to some of the county it's the largest employer\nI also obviously a huge provider of healthcare services so he said they're going about this looking for a partner a potential partner ... again it kept qualifying by saying if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out where it will go\nBut they're looking for a potential partner who more than anything else would increase services certain procedures that people now feel like they need to go to Cleveland or to ... to Columbus or Pittsburgh for those services for the full range of them and so they want I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "city":
