next we're bringing you interviews we conducted with candidates in major races in Ohio today it's the two vying for US Senate\nAnd a bit we'll hear from Republican Jim Renee seat the challenger now we continue our conversation with the incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown you mentioned earlier and we\nTalked about Medicaid its impact on the opioid crisis in Ohio how can the federal government better help Ohio and other states deal with this epidemic\nOhio because of this corrupt government of payday lending scandal and online for profit school\nTheft of tax dollars and and a betrayal it's public school students Ohio simply is falling down on the job when it comes to dealing with the opioid public health crisis on\nFederal government's done some things in the last few days that are useful putting more dollars into communities so they can scale up treatment programs uh we've adopted language that senator Portman I've worked on a there's a facility in Dayton only two in the United states Huntington in Dayton at focus specifically on babies born too addicted mothers\nAre in those facilities on costs significantly less than putting the baby and neo natal unit\n... unique to you and it's\nI'm much less the cost and we're able to get that language in this bill that will be expanded across the country um again saving taxpayer dollars making a huge difference\nBut Congress needs to do more than one of the things that I'm working on with a Republican from West Virginia is that the federal government's already spending money on Medicaid courses we're talking and and also spending money on job training we need to combine some of those efforts so when somebody goes through as they're in a in a tree if in a treatment program in\nIn ... glitter in Westlake or in Medina they can get a job training at the same time so when they're clean when they've gone through the treatment program they're ready to go into the workforce that there's some other things we need to do to really do this well international way partnering with local communities\nWe were talking a little bit about the economy earlier and it's been ten years since the financial crisis how do you assess the impact of Dodd Frank and other legislation passed to shore up the financial system and protect consumer so I\nI think it's been a success the auto rescue as a success of the Dodd Frank bill the fix Wall Street successive it fell short in a couple of ways\nI'm willing to talk about the successes briefly first it set up a consumer agency that rich Cordray ran\nAnd this consumer bureau is saved a twelve million Americans a total of about thirty billion dollars when they've been wronged or cheated by a payday lender or a bank or someone else so that's been a good thing the system is much more stable than it was the problem is that\nA whole lot of members of Congress have this collective amnesia already we're seeing administrators we're seeing regulators in Washington\nI'm begin to relax rules there is a proposal now to reduce the the capital requirements for the largest banks in the country um those are the ones that got us into this and I when I said we're it's worked in where it has it that the the shortcoming of it was nobody went to prison nobody was punish\nCompanies and banks were punished but they were punished by letting fees against fines against their stock holders um executives rarely paid a price and know exists\nKnow some of the banking committee I see it in the Senate\nI said Washington that there's this collective amnesia about what happened two years ago and we we can't we can these rules we can't scale back the regulations I mean it's great to St deregulation get rid of regulations well there's a ... one of the reasons we had the the financial implosion a decade ago is because\nThe Bush administration week and a lot of these rules or when it came to making the banks behave and when we know what will happen when the large banks get to free an easy with their money\nThey leverage too much debt um they they keep less capital on hand and a problem happens and they think and then they're going to ask for bail out again and we just can't let that happen\nLet's talk about immigration a you've obviously said a number of time to use ... opposed a lot of President Trump's policies the travel restrictions and other curbs on immigration what would be a smarter immigration policy well you you start\nWith we have twelve or Thirteen million people in this country that are that are not documented um we're not going to deport all of them are that's really impossible to do especially since and many many many of them are employed and all kinds of jobs often jobs that Americans don't want to work in and\nUm mostly pretty low wage jobs are you but you find a path to citizenship you you you don't give them citizenship they've got to earn it they've got to get in line they've got to pay taxes they say some will get become citizens by serving in the military which has happened in the past\nOther runs by getting in line and working your way up to citizenship um you don't you don't separate families at the border those families will never recover from that in some cases and ultimately this country is richer because we've had we've had a steady stream of\nOf doing immigration generally right whether it's the number of fortune five hundred companies created by immigrants um whether it's the work that low wage workers do\nYou don't believe the border wall that President Trump ran on and talks about is necessary but would you vote to fund it if the compromise was right I Would vote I wouldn't do\nA ... yes the answer is yes if we should if if the price of\nGetting a good immigration policy the two main or me no more family separations\nThat will allow people a path to citizenship that will help\nAmerican companies that want to hire immigrants um if the price of that is to partially funded a border wall coming in that the the problem with that as the president promised the law but he promised over and over and over the Mexicans will pay for these forgotten that part of the promise now he's willing to sail shut the government down unless you unless you give me the money for\nThe wall so they can get the Mexicans to pay for the wall do it build it and then let's talk about other things we need a well I'm I don't think all the best way to um\nTo to deal with immigration and deal with people coming across the border me there ... I I take a backseat to nobody and force them into more of the border and making sure that our borders safe but you do it with hiring ice agents you do it through technology and do it with helicopters you do it with all the kinds of police work that\nAmerican law enforcement needs knows how to do you don't spend thirty four billion or whatever the most recent figures and keeps going up number of dollars um to build a wall when um it causes so many other problems like building a law\nIt's talk about the skills gap we hear so much about that employers say the skills gap prevents them from finding qualified workers for good paying jobs what kind of federal government do to address this problem specifically in Ohio and elsewhere around the\nGovernment wanting things I mentioned on a in terms of opioid treatment they should combine some some a department of labor job training dollars with Medicaid treatment dollars than opioids we we need to recognize better than we do that not every kid wants to go to college some want to go to try ...\nSomebody some people just want to be done with school at Eighteen and they'll figure it out\nUm they can get better on the job training um but we after we have to recognize that to start with I mean we're we're doing something that nobody ever thought about doing before about ten years ago somebody to White House said to me everybody wants more manufacturing in the United states but nobody wants their kid to do it\nAll along look we pass and I voted for a bill out of the house it didn't pass the Senate the problem in the Senate to off in his career politicians make decisions based on next election not next generation we said let's make sure that everybody that's on Medicaid in Ohio there's enough dollars for them to let's give that\nTo the end and for the next two years everybody that's eligible let's give the state of Ohio enough money that's block grant them enough money so they have the money to take care of her let's let then you come up with the decisions on how they take care of those individuals that really are the neediest of need and then let's turn around\nAnd make sure that health care is affordable for everyone let's bring transparency and that's a big issue one of the reasons are costs are so high is we don't have enough transparency into the healthcare system but let's not forget about middle Americans middle mom middle dad\nMiddle Americans who are struggling every day and working every day and can't afford\nThe deductible so they really don't have health care they have a they they have insurance but they don't have access\nYou mentioned Medicaid and your answer what do you think of the Medicaid expansion in Ohio that was pushed by governor ... Rob Portman has said that expanded Medicaid has been critical and addressing the opioid epidemic what would you say about Medicaid expansion here\nIs unsustainable here's my biggest fear if a if we're if we're banking on something that's unsustainable at some point in time it's going to be gone so why don't we come up with a program that works that's why I said why don't we block grant money and make sure these individuals are taking care of but let's give it to the state to state make those decisions you can have\nA a program this one out ... percent relying on the federal government that is but basically the controller general uh came out just a a month and a half ago and said we're on an unsustainable path and the federal government or debts and deficits are growing at such a a pace\nThat none of this a sustainable well if it's not sustainable shouldn't we make sure that we have a sustainable program for life\nBeen around for twenty five years the opioid epidemic epidemic a lot of it is because of policies that we have put in the federal government think about some of these policies why are we changing policies is not about money it's not about money anymore it's about policies\nSo you don't agree with who would be your fellow senator and Ohio that the expansion of Medicaid is critical in addressing this opioid crisis you would see these other avenues to a independent of the Medicaid expansion is the way to attack\nWell look Ohio is the number one state for Medicaid or addiction and abuse for opioid addiction abuse angst I okay um they're Nineteen states that didn't do Medicaid expansion how come they're not there how come they're not there so here's a I'm a business guy I look at I don't look at these things from politics or policies I look at these things from process\nAnd resolve and here's the difference how come the Nineteen states don't have an opioid overdose addiction or an opioid I'm Sorry addiction process you know I think in some ways yes Medicaid expansion has given us more dollars but the policies of the federal government in many cases or the policies of the state government because that's the education system\nHave driven up to the opioid epidemic that's where we need to be lucky\nYou mentioned the word a deficit and one of your answers and that leads me to a question about the tax cuts that were implemented this year you supported the large cuts enacted a at the end of last year actually permanent for corporations temporary for individual taxpayers\nAre they having the effect on the economy that you and your colleagues anticipated and what about the impact on the national debt\nAbsolutely they're having the effect on the economy looked at Ohio look at overall ... we have a four point two percent growth rate we need that\nWe have a over forty companies that I just got a list of I don't have it with me that have not only given bonuses out those employees are expanding creating more jobs I was just with a company in northeast Ohio that went from Seventy employees to a hundred and forty police because of the tax cutting JOBS Act so it is\nBill we have the seed build director I'm On the budget committee to Mindy my opponent needs to get on the budget committee because what he would learn is that our deficit is really being driven by demographics and that came from the CB oh director that's a televised a report that we can see when I asked the CBO director what's driving or deficits he said demographics\nSo do you throw your hands up and say we can't do anything about the the deficit\nNo I think we got to do things about the deficit but we got to look at what's driving the deficits demographics his policies that were put in place\nYears ago that assume people like in Medicare Medicaid and Social Security would die at age sixty five it's politicians who are afraid to make those tough decisions there are a lot of opportunities to fix things in the Medicare system let's go to transparency by the way in the Medicare system let's put the seven hundred thousand back in\nThere was taken out from the Affordable CARE Act that's another issue that's why I said the Affordable CARE Act actually this is driven some of these issues but at the same time\nLet's look at the drivers\nWhen we go back here's a here's a classic answer always get well in this in the nineties we didn't have a deficit\nAnd here's what I've I've learned about those nineties remember I'm On the budget committee during those six years when President Clinton was president we didn't have a deficit and when governor case it was the head of the budget committee if you go back and look you're going to find out that the federal government budget for two trillion dollars in spending but spent over four so how do they have a surplus\nWell here's how they had a surplus it had nothing to do with government policies that had nothing to do with government spending here's what happened if you go back to those years you'll find out that we had the tech boom\nWe had the economy growing economy was growing six point two percent six point three percent six point seven percent the numbers were astounding that's what we need what's his tax cutting jobs where we cannot live\nWith a one point eight percent average growth that under the President Obama's economy we need a growth that exceeds three percent or getting that done with the tax cut jobs bill that's\nAble to drive or growth rate up\nWhat about wages the tax cuts have succeeded in having companies be able to afford stock buybacks they're going to reach a record trillion dollars this year\nBut by most accounts real wages have not increased and ignoring inflation wages themselves are only up around a little less than three percent over the last twelve months\nWhat about the promise that this money would go to workers while\nIt has what if you saw the results came out just last week we have jobs up we have wages up and we have unemployment down that's what's starting to happen we have examples all throughout the state of Ohio where bonuses are being given\nThe by the way if they're going to talk about it wage increases how about the last eight years under the Obama administration how about the last twenty five years while Sherrod Brown was the senator\nTake a look at those years and then let's talk about what's happened the last six months\nGiven that the stock market was booming and the companies were already flush why was or indeed for such a large corporate tax cuts\nAgain we were losing our companies overseas we were the highest tax\nRate in the world at thirty five percent the next lowest was I think twenty five percent in Japan but the objectives like half of that [laughter] it doesn't matter even the effective were in the top three [noise] I've I've had a debate this multiple times were the top three or four highest countries in the world even an ineffective right\nHow can you compete when other companies are when other countries I'm Sorry like Ireland or seven percent corporate or even Canada\nIs it are in the mid teens we have to be able to compete at the same time we have to make sure those companies stay here in the job stay here I had an interesting meeting I was in uh Europe I think it was two years ago and I was meeting with\nAll the individuals about their the treasury and how they were going to grow their economy you know what they said we're going to drive our corporate rate down\nThe United states basically and they go well we're talking about hopefully getting companies from the United states to come here that was their whole idea\nThat's the reason why we have to be competitive we are in a global economy we have to be a competitive we have to make sure the companies will stay here survive here and pay good wages that's why the tax cutting jobs bill is Mabel to get that done\nLet's talk trade this year President Trump raised tariffs against China Canada the European Union other us trading partners who are among the biggest fires of the goods grown and made you know Ohio or these tariffs good for Ohio's economy\nWill look in the long run China started a a tariff war that we need to be able to finish too many presidents have allowed this to just continue to fester and cause us to have some really unfair trading issues with China\nAt the same time when I support is not a long term ... program I Believe in free trade fair trade and reciprocal trade\nIs that what you're seeing out of the White House\nWell what I'm seeing all the White House is a negotiation opportunity there using tariffs and negotiate I'm okay with that\nBut I'm also going to represent Ohio let's face it as I travel the state I've had the difference between myself and share brown is I've been traveling the state I just don't go to union halls I was in the middle of farmers\nIn Nashville last week I was down south ah with soybean producers you know I've been with the manufacturers the Honda or in Marysville I've talked to them about their effects are concerned\nThey're absolutely concerned and what I always say to them as your your concerns me and we should eliminate these tariffs and what they say is look we're comfortable today and negotiations\nAnd we're losing some negotiation but the long run terrorists will not be good for Ohio so what I tell the president all the time and that's probably the you know people always say to me do you disagree with the president on a lot of things that go I disagree with the president on several things and one of them is I'm not too sure terrorists is good good for Ohio in the long run I Do think they're good", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "17"}
