then by the endless wailing of sirens\nWhen the carnage was complete eleven people lay dead they were members of all three congregations which are housed in the tree of life synagogue in this world

moment of disconnection from the week a temporal boy that's supposed to be kept clear of work technology and concern for material things\nSaturday and Pittsburgh in Cleveland in Jerusalem and for Jews worldwide the concern was that once more than American house of worship was the seat of unspeakable carnage this time carried out explicitly because the worshipers were of the Jewish faith\nProsecutors will seek the death penalty against suspect Robert Bowers but that's not our focus today we will hear this hour from those who were there in Pittsburgh those who observed from here and in some cases who drove to western Pennsylvania to partake in one of several vigils and we'll hear about the next steps to be taken to ensure doesn't happen once more\nLater in the program we'll talk with several rabbis about the larger picture but we begin with two news reporters from Pittsburgh only hearing as a reporter for the NPR station there Ninety point five W E s say good morning\n\nUntil the ... is a senior staff writer at Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle good morning to you\nAnyway\nAnd we learned counseled by the ... with the bigger stores you told us what came next responses and it's been really run the remarkable was a month\nAnd it has the community has really come together here in Pittsburgh a there's\nA deep sense of pain or as has to be expected but also a real resolve to unify as a community and to support each other across faith in identities last night there was a vigil at this\nLarge auditorium and the Oakland neighborhood in Pittsburgh called soldiers and sailors and thousands turned out for that the the crowd overflowed outside of the auditorium which is a grand hall out onto the large front lawn so it really was a show of a\n... it it it does and it it's it's rising in ways that we haven't seen before just you know to\nAbout that there was a fifty seven percent increase in anti Semitism just last year\nAnd and and it's scary now because it's hitting home and it's hitting home in a way that we never thought imagine we'll just to give you a sense of just how small community is right now on the line you at rabbi Chuck diamond who I grew up with the camping and about eight years ago my my dad was born and raised in Pittsburgh and and every year we would come back\nUm to go to a Steelers football game and a game or two and and during when rabbi diamond was at a tree of life or with a single car running the congregation there\nWe would stop being on Shabaab morning just to say Hi to the rabbi diamond who we know from our days at the same camp the people he just mentioned um ah that you spoke to before or the same campers that were my campers at camp\nThe Pittsburgh community much like Cleveland is is one that is that small it's one that small and it it's hitting us now in a way that we never thought I yesterday I was walking\nRight by the synagogue and I overheard a conversation with a a a mom and about her five year old son and her son said\nMommy is that the place where where the where the people were killed just becomes because they came to synagogue and the mom was silent she didn't have an answer because she knew her five year old son was exactly right they were killed because they came to synagogue because they are Jewish and the rise in anti Semitism has now come to this and it's ...\nGeographically we're closed the city is very much the same or the communities close with each other\nYou know outside of their uh you know their their rivalry in in in football um they are they're very much the same they are very much similar yesterday at a large delegation from Cleveland came down for the large vigil\nIt's no it's no accident that that meat as as regional director for the Anti Defamation league includes both Cleveland and Pittsburgh it's within the same region it's because they're similar communities they're small town communities but there are urging the number and strength and power and they bond together\nAnd their family ties and they have um close commitment to to their to their Jewish community into into each other and it's a it's a real testament to the people it's a real testament to the people like rabbi diamond ... are you know\nOur kids share share common programming also understand region conservatives youth group um and they go to conventions together so that there is a strong bond\nUm and his rabbi path is that I'm very proud of him I have to say but uh there is just the closeness it's just such a wonderful community and not just the Jewish community as to say the entire city of Pittsburgh I I was raised there\nI I live there in the house I grew up in and I raised my kids are and in type ... is a wonderful place to live we're feeling the support of people not only around the country and in Cleveland and in other parts of the world but the pits and unity is really coming together\nI heard the FBI talking about needing a week to process the scene do you even look to win the next meeting a tree of life\nWell again I'm not a I'm not the rabbi there anymore but I I it it's going to take a week I Know that the congregations involves will be meeting at another conservative congregation that shut loans for as long as they need to um I also know that\nThat it or is that it's very difficult situation so I assume they'll do what they need to do and people will take as long as they need to stay in the meantime other congregations will certainly open to the fullest to us um and and to the congregation sizzle\nMhm [noise] read my Baptists or the vice president said Saturday that he rejects suggestions of rhetoric from the president and others in the Republican Party has contributed to the rise of political violence by we're certainly seemed energized by what he heard ... would say you and you think about this from a security standpoint\nYou know our our approaches that when when anti Semitic rhetoric or dog whistling has allowed in in our public sphere without condemnation especially from our leaders um it gives a green light to anti Semite to just about it and to keep spouting it and\nActing on it and in some ways and and all leaders on all sides of the aisle and all all leaders in in the religious here in the public sphere of any type\nUm they have the responsibility and a real responsibility to call out hey\nI'm whenever it arises and and that's incumbent on everyone and people need to speak out\nUm people really need to speak out not only just those um in in positions of leadership that goes on the ground as well um I can give you a a brief example on on Saturday Night in Ohio there was a um a Saturday Night swastika party that took place at a haunted house in in rural Ohio\nAnd if that incident happened a few weeks ago I think I Would have probably gotten\nYou know under ten calls on the incident I've ... I've been flooded with with over two hundred calls and emails\nAlerting me that this took place and that's how you stop paid and that's how you stop anti Semitism it it has to be um both bottom up and top down so we we really look to every one to call out hating in all forms\nDifficult because while freedom to worship was protected right freedom of speech\nThe party or there are a lot more of those in Ohio than we're aware of it doesn't get major coverage\nThere we've seen over all across the country there's been as I mentioned earlier there was a rise fifty seven percent rise of anti Semitic incidents in the past year\nOhio I was one of those states that saw a sharp spike I'm\n... and as you said there is certainly that delicate balance between um freedom of speech and freedom of religion um but just because someone has the freedom to speak doesn't mean they have\nUm that doesn't mean they ought to speak and and as rabbi Myers has rather Jeffrey Maier the rabbi of tree of life yesterday said yesterday at the vigil here in Pittsburgh um he\nHe often think about what his mother told him when he was growing up that if if one doesn't have anything I say don't say anything at all um and and that's certainly true when it comes to hate speech um just because you have a right to it doesn't mean you have a you walk to use it\nRead by John Diamond as the rabbi murders a tree of life sir again our condolences thank you so much for joining us today\nI cheated and thank you so much the way you do\nAnd rabbi Germany happens is that of the Cleveland Anti Defamation league a it's a fight that we have to continue Germany isn't it\nThat we we need to be vigilant it's something that we we really need 'em we need more people involved more people raising their voices as we look to the community the Jewish and I'm Jewish community to\nHelp us stop hate and help us fight the decimation of of of the Jewish people and secure fair treatment for for all people for all people\nOkay thank you so much for your time this morning it's much appreciate thanks for having me we're going to continue this conversation with additional guest and your phone call this the lines are stacking up already but continue to call eight six six five seven eight zero nine zero three I'm Rick Jackson and listening to the sound of ideas on mighty point three\nThoughts on today shell sending emails to ask why did you see P.

issue one the only state\nWell currently would be charged as low level felonies would become misdemeanors with no jail time unless there's a third offense within a two year period there are a number of other provisions too including symptoms productions for inmates were rehabilitated work or educational programming provided they're not in prison for murder rape or child molestation\nIt would direct any savings from incarceration to be used for drug treatment\nNow we're going to hear from both sides of the issue one debate in an effort to provide you with information to make your decision will begin with the pro side by presenting in my conversation with Steven Johnson grove of the Ohio justice in Policy Center then we'll hear from chief justice Moreno corner of the Ohio Supreme Court who opposes issue one\nFirst I ask proponents Steven Johnson grove who this measure specifically aims to help\nWell it's mostly focused on folks that have been convicted or threatened with conviction for being you know having a disease what both the chief justice than most\nA professional knowledge of the brain disease of addiction ah it also focuses on people who are being thrown in prison for low level non criminal probation violations\nReally we're focused on getting the people that don't belong in prison out as well as the dollars that don't belong in that prison budget out doing something more productive in our community here previously\nHad success in seeing legislation passed so why this time decided to go through the state constitution\nYeah the Ohio justice and Policy Center has been successful in a lot of a statewide a legislative efforts to reduce barriers for people with criminal records I'm opening up job opportunities for people that have turned their lives around\nThe problem we saw is that so many people end up in the justice system that never belong there so not only do we need to remove barriers after they get out of prison we really need to send fewer people in in the first place\nYou know when someone gets a felony a drug possession case there are five hundred and eighty state laws and regulations that apply to them\nThat say they can't get jobs can't get housing\nThe economic burden so we were tired of seeing so many people's lives thrown away or by the experience of incarceration for as I said you know the disease of addiction they really don't belong in state prison that's a waste of resources and a waste of people's lives\nIf this were to pass is there a mechanism for immediate relief of inmates jolt him to the current rules is that something the measure addresses or our inmates at the mercy of the deal sea getting to them\nIt's not immediate relief but it is regulated each person that had is in prison if they're only in prison for a low level non violent drug possession case can petition to the court to ask to have their case ... classified down to a misdemeanor\nThat would potentially allow them to you know the chance to be released because of course a misdemeanor can't spend time in state prison that's only for families\nSo that is possible but it will have to go through each individual court the big relief though it's not just people getting out of prison but hundreds of thousands of dollars a hundred million dollars we project will be saved from the state budget because so many people will not be in prison\nThat the impact of the community because all that money we take out of the state prison budget and put it back into the community into evidence based drug treatment and crime victim services\nMost of the published that I find ... of the nearly fifty thousand inmates in the state prison only about twenty seven hundred are actually there on fourth and fifth degree felony is not all of them there for drug possession not even close to some of the numbers that we've heard what's the discrepancy\nWell you have to understand there's fifty thousand people in Ohio State prison there's been fifty thousand since about two thousand seven despite many failed legislative attempts to do something about it\nThe problem that you don't see is that there's twenty thousand people to go into state prison every year and twenty thousand that come back out so there was a constant flow so your number there about twenty seven hundred people's a snapshot on today you know October Eighteenth or nineteenth ah that doesn't reflect\nTwo years or less so what we need to do is reduced that flow\nThe other thing in terms of impact you have to understand is we're going to prevent people going to prison for non violent or non criminal probation violations\nAbout forty seven hundred people a year nearly a quarter of the people going into prison every year are going in for probation violations that are not new felonies so we really are throwing away a lot of lives on stuff that doesn't belong in state prison\nThat's the kind of flow we have to produce a and there are also the earns credit which we can get into if you'd like\nOK Now let's move on I'm One of your most noted opponents is Supreme Court chief justice Marino caught her she was on the program a couple of weeks ago we talked for quite a while on the idea that she wanted to stress to voters that this proposal allows people carrying a fence\nAnd they'll to kill ten thousand people to escape felony drug charges why no exclusionary language included about that one specific substance\nWell I mean what we're trying to deal with those people addicted to substances so yes people with uh the lower quantities that are addicted to a substance ... cents an hour or heroin or\nAny other substance a you know they're going to be eligible what her argument or Mrs and I will point out your colleagues in the media both a political act or politifact the Columbus dispatch and Akron beacon journal have all called that scare tactics and lies because that's exactly what it is\nThe quantities offense and all the chief justice is talking about are charged and prosecuted and convicted of trafficking every day of the week in every corner of this state by state and federal prosecutors I talked to a federal prosecutor that wrapped up in drug trafficking ... trafficking case for two ramps\nSo this twenty grams of fat no Boogie Man argument really misses the boat or because those are going to be dealt with as trafficking it's the people with the small quantities that are really users are that are going to get the benefit of not going to prison which is ...\nWith not Ohioans George Soros Mark Zuckerberg Nicolas parts are pumping more than four million dollars into this one race\nYou know it's it's interesting I haven't heard Mr to wind up talking about the ... numerous out out of state uh donations he's got or other gubernatorial candidates or even the chief justice in her past campaigns have gone out of state donations so yes people outside of Ohio are concerned about what happens here Ohio's a bellwether state as we all know\nUh and of course we're at the epicenter of this tragedy fourteen people are dying per day in this state you know we're second only to West Virginia in our overdose rate\nSo yes there are people outside the state that I Want to help you know remedy this tragedy but the other thing to note is it the issue one was written by myself and several other people from Ohio issue one was created by Ohioans\nFor Ohioans and long after the issue was written that campaign was built the team is out there collecting signatures then we get donations from the outside so yes they did come donations from the outside\nBut not before there was a very strong Ohio farm team making this happen\nThat organization representing more than one hundred fifty private alcohol drug mental health and family services agency's announced Wednesday it opposes issue one do widely noted statements like that concern you at all\nWell if I understood it correctly was primarily because they're concerned about doing it through the state constitution they agreed that addiction is a disease and then we need to not you know harm people unnecessarily with incarceration if I understood it right\nAh but throwing people's lives away or you know we're all on the same team about that question is whether we can do it to a constitutional amendment\nAnd you know what we have to really look take a hard hard look at\nIs how many times the legislature has failed\nWill have to leave it there thank you Steven Johnson grow the Ohio justice and Policy Center he joined us from the tea in
