those reviews they would have refused disobeyed ... that those goods company justice\nAnd they felt that what was needed with a new kind of a stomach media that spoke to youth in in in ways that they were familiar with from watching a reality shows are music videos or Hollywood entertainment\nSo I became interested in how these creatures were trying to re imagined what Islamic media sounds and looks like [noise]\nOne of the first major events where these new preachers began to show their influence with during the Egyptian revolution in twenty eleven\nDuring the actual Eighteen days of the uprising against Mubarak most people were not interested in watching Islamic television pictures there were very interested in watching BBC ... uh CNN and watching news coverage of the revolution\nBut immediately after Mubarak resigned people began to look to Islamic television preachers to offer them kind of commentary or solutions to the many political problems and economic problems that Egypt was facing\nSo it was interesting to see was how the Islamic television preachers I was working with began to re imagine their role as kind of social critics or as people who would offer various kinds of solutions to the different problems facing\nEgypt in the immediate aftermath of the revolution [noise]\nSo my ... is a very important to sonic media figure he is a thirty something preacher who's currently pursuing a PHD at Cambridge University in the u._k. an over the past years Masood has really been pushing the boundaries of what Islamic media or it's\nIt was\nRight after the revolution whereas the Masood releasing important program called a follow up on and that's an Arabic or a revolution within a revolution of the self where he called on Egyptians to\nTo become new kinds of people people who would kind of live up to the promise of revolutionary Egypt in terms of democracy and coexistence and tolerance\nAnd uh and civil disagreement\nAnd he did that through our religious idiom for most Muslims the solution to political and economic problems lies in a more correct understanding of what the Islamic tradition teaches and upholds\nSo when you tune into his YouTube channel you're going to find him singing with a guitar with one of Egypt or most famous revolutionary artists and he's going to be singing a song\nAgainst a dogmatic thinking weather from a religious people or a non religious people [noise]\nAnd ... ...\nYou're going to find him starring in a TV drama series that also has a religious message to impart over thirty episode\nThe ...\n...\nSo those are the kinds of a new format that him and other creatures like him are really innovating in their attempt to reach new audiences to reach a young Muslims in ways that they will actually find compelling\nBut ... is just one of many prominent figures in the middle east right now and they don't all share the same ideas\nPrecisely because the Islamic television sector is largely privately owned and privately funded there exists a wide spectrum of theological an ideological orientations on Islamic television Islamic television is not a model\n... and we also have to think about it's opposite which is moderation and the idea of of religious moderation has a very long history within the Muslim world including in the pre modern era but what moderation means and what voices get labeled as extremist is is not a stable thing it's it's constantly changing\nBut one thing is clear is that today for the vast majority of Muslims ISIS is an extremist group or in the sense that it's norms and practices are beyond the pale of what a most Muslims would agree their religion teaches\nAnd so when it comes to efforts to combat ISIS you're going to see a lot of cooperation among groups that normally don't get along\nAnd Islamic television preachers see themselves as having a very important role in this regard\nOr because they see their main role as teaching Muslims what Islam really means or what it really entails\nBut most of combating violent ideologies isn't always a huge priority for these creatures she says that's because relatively few people are actually recruited to join ISIS\nBeen a lot of panic lately about the recruitment success of ISIS among young Muslims but if you look at the numbers you realize this is really an unfounded panic even Tunisia which has sent the most young people to ISIS as of last year it sent six thousand people\nNot Tunisia's population is twelve million\nAnd you can begin to ... to put the number of six thousand in perspective and that's the biggest the biggest so sort of a country that has sent young people to ISIS and I think that the biggest counter narrative\nTwo groups like ISIS and their extremism actually comes from the reality that the vast majority of ISIS victims have been other Muslims are not just Shiite Muslims but actually Sunni Muslims in the U.S um we tend to focus on ISIS attacks\nIce has carried out one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Egyptian history where basically killed three hundred people praying in a mosque in a town of only seven hundred\nPeople [laughter]\nSo why some half the population of of of this village to the biggest victims of terrorism committed by Muslims are actually other Muslims and so I think what we need\nIs less religious counter narratives because those are alive and well on more of a treatment of the context that allow violent ideologies and the allergies to flourish and this would mean addressing structural problems like\nEconomic inequality political corruption as well as the human devastation brought by western military intervention in the region\nAnd I think you know us as American citizens we have an opportunity to hold our government accountable\nFor the ways in which his policies un actions in the middle east have actually created a breeding ground for groups like ISIS\nThat's the as me more she's a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan [noise]\nObvious that the media landscape in the middle east is a vast and that means that for an outsider it's really hard to understand the U.S has tried to harness the power of the media there in order to promote its own interests but there are things us policymakers just don't get about how religious and political issues on line in the middle east\nThat's according to Nathan Brown he's a professor of political science at George Washington university what the United States is concerned about is often\nI Am and so what we will sometimes do is come in and say okay this person is with us on the Palestinian issue this government is with us on Yemen and therefore it sort of back them across the board\nAnd what we miss in the process is that there's much much deeper dialogue going on that\nThe divisions are not really over short term policy issues but over long term concerns about the place of religion in public life about who has the authority to interpret Islam and that sort of thing and so we tend to be very short term and very clumsy and the way that we intervene in these things\nAnd a good example of that might be Saudi Arabia officially an ally despite its harsh treatment of dissidents and the lack of free speech there\nI think the American policy reaction has been very very short term and focus when Hamid been cemented Saudi Arabia talks this way when I'm there to see the the president of Egypt talks this way\nAmerican policymakers tend to come in and applaud them saying that's exactly the right message we've got leaders who are willing to take on the top religious issues\nAnd so what the essentially do is aligned themselves with machines that are putting out what sounds from the international audience like a moderate message but to a domestic audience can often sound like a controlling and micromanaging message\nRight and so then does that engenders suspicion of the United states in the part of the of the population of the populace\nTo be honest I think on religious grounds the United states really isn't an actor or the people would listen to secretary of State Kerry during the Obama administration very famously referred to the out of here and so the Islamic state as apostate\nSupport for coverage of community affairs programming on ... point three WC piano Idea Stream comes in\nPart from the George gun foundation advance in

of evidence packets that sat on police department shells for years before being tested there's been a hot button issue on the campaign trail especially about a point of debate between Mike DeWine and Richard Cordray candidates for governor and former they're both former attorneys general\nCrime labs scientist completed testing and the newly fourteen thousand backlog rape kits in February but testing hasn't led to criminal prosecutions evenly across the state\nCuyahoga County has logged at three hundred and Seventy convictions and rape kit cases since twenty Thirteen statewide only a few dozen similar cases\nHave even made it to court a new state law that went into effect in twenty Fifteen makes rape kit testing mandatory but it does not mandate any follow up every investigation of cases\nWhat approach the Cuyahoga County take that led to so many criminals being brought to justice and can other law enforcement agencies and prosecutors learned from northeast Ohio the plain dealer concluded an eight month survey of the state's law enforcement agencies to find out what happened after the rape kits were tested\nThe survey and which reporters across the state and volunteers assisted\nTurned up this surprising inaction outside of Cuyahoga County\nAnd joining me to discuss the survey its findings and what might be learned from Cuyahoga County is approach to rape kit evidence we have in Studio Rachel Dissell she's a reporter with the plain dealer who has been on\nThe rape kit story from the very start and stays on it good to have you with us and well anyway the morning also with us is Rachel labelle she's a senior research associate with the guns Center for violence prevention research and education\nAt Case Western Reserve University good have you with us into somebody and Rick bell is here to use the special investigations division chief for the guy yoga county prosecutor's office ...\nCan call and ask any questions easy to get three experts on this

commit\nThe plain dealer has covered this you've covered it other reporters have as well finally we get all the testing Daniel we find out what happens in Cuyahoga County but the question is what happened to everywhere else that's a big patch so you have some help with it\nFor instance and then we've got quite success without which again leads us back to a suspect and then from there we can do our interviews and as you said we've indicted\nSeven hundred and two defendants so far in three hundred and Seventy convictions or we've gone across the country to\nMake sure that people realize the success that they can have if they're willing to actually do this and that's what it comes down to a willingness to actually not just look at the top of the file with crack it opened and and do more with\nRachel Dissell you talk to police chief yourself and to use other reporters did too and you find in a number of cases resin Steven reopen the file do they do they look at Cuyahoga County in say three hundred Seventy conviction there must be something\nYou know I think it depends like the size of the departments they might think like Cleveland is just so different than us said that what happens in my city is probably not the same as what happens in Cleveland but I think there's something that's similar from any police department is that there's kind of a reluctance to second guess decisions someone made in the past\nAnd I think there's also reluctance to really reach out and sit down with victims who maybe didn't have the best experience with police before or have had other issues with\nYou know with police and talk to them but I Do think that there there is some hope I don't want to be the um for cynical person that nothing will ever change so I'm Maria DeVito is a reporter for the Newark advocate\nTalked to um a detective therapy and the workplace and you know he was talking about how when they first started that um you know going and talking to victims and talking to victims in a lot of them were reluctant they really didn't\nWe got this information but I really want to let you know that I don't want to pressure you but you're not the only person that we think this person did this to and you might not be Standing Alone and so I think that that brings up the other thing that kind of was shocking to us was that even in cases where\nThere were links between two different cases so we're we're police were aware that there was maybe a hit in one city in a hit in another or two of their own cases linked\nThey weren't always acting differently on that you know for instance you know one of the officers and Barbara ten told 'em Akron beacon journal that they had a hit and it was still known suspect and they weren't going to follow up on it because they declined to go forward on the case at the time it was reported it [noise]\nNo the the the the prosecutor you know at the time um I didn't think it was a strong enough case but there was another hit to an Akron case\nAnd they're kind of response to that was you know we'll let we'll see what Akron does with that it wasn't like wow this person's now linked to two cases what could that mean\nAnd so that was the part that was kind of disconcerting to me that that that information is a law enforcement and individual you should think that sounds like an investigation to me you know like let's look into that\nBut it was hoping maybe someone else would do it or really I don't think this is still a good case so\nMy question is like how do you get folks to start thinking about investigating differently from the beginning and and then looking\nTo the evidence that's come up with some of the research at the center and other places that there are really strong Syria links you know you know most people are not going out and raping people but when they do they they target more than one person that's just\nThe way that they are finding it and that's only based on you know reported rapes so I don't know how you kind of turn turn the sinking in that direction um for all types of cases not just in big cities button and medium sized places too especially where people travel between two smaller medium sized cities that you got to be looking for that\nWas sort of read more than one person based on this DNA a hit that would seem to me to be to hold sway with a law enforcement version of you can convince them but what we're talking about is getting a predator off the street from some misunderstanding of what they might have judge Twenty years ago but it was an actual a predator [noise]\nYeah so I think that was one of the most surprising things to everyone involved um as part in the early days of testing rape kits is just how many serial offenders were being identified either because they hit to another kit or kids or because they're criminal history also indicates that they've done it before um and and\nAnd I think the reason why law enforcement didn't have all the information is because the DNA wasn't there to sort of show how all these linked together once the hits in particular are linking it the kids are linking to each other you can see and uh you know offenders raping strangers and non strangers\nVastly bearing they're sending patterns across one so without DNA that offenses were just so different from each other they wouldn't have been linked together these no one would have thought these two rapes would have would have been done by the same offender\nWhich is why I think it's so important to actually test all the kids not just when the offender is a stranger or not just necessarily stop at the\nThe first testing this sort of intimate swabs that are usually tested as part of the kid but really to try to to test all the evidence that there to test all the kids because then you're going to get those that larger image that larger picture about the full offending pattern and\nWhen you do that you see that you know they often drastically very they're offending patterns\nWhich is why you can see those links across jurisdiction alliance across different types of sexual assault\nLaw enforcement version which this was a relationship situation and show it was a one off and we're not even going to deal with it but if you tested that you know you might find that that offender not only\nUh and the a and the data that that we've had working with the prosecutor's office\nUm you can see for the kids that has linked to each other just you know offenders will will raped women and men offenders will rape intimate partners and strangers and children and you know so you see these vastly different types of of offending pattern some are used weapons sometimes they don't\nUm at those types of things that\nThat really speak to why testing is important but then also use it fully using that information from the testing so that it isn't just a sheet of paper and a case file that you're really using it\nTo change that deep the practices some of these practices that law enforcement had been using are effective\nBut I think that the backlog tells us that that some of the practices weren't affected we didn't necessarily support victims in the process we didn't always believe victims we did we tended to look at it as an isolation and he said she said\nUm and so the willingness to sort of say well some things we were doing that effective so what can we do to learn from each other and and change those practices that are as effective\nWe're going to take a quick break writer and pick up our

I'm hoping that maybe media and some of the places where these other departments exist will kind of pick that up and and ask their departments similar questions I think that will take the information that we've collected which I think it's a pretty solid information we we kind of ...\nPretty good cross section of places that are suburban and rural and cities um so I I think it is pretty representative um some of our volunteers and the volunteer group has asked for us to put together kind of like a one page primer if the information so they can share more widely [noise]\nUm I Would look to see what state lawmakers do with this type of information um there is kind of advisory group which I think Rick as part of\nLooking at possibly having like a rape kit tracking system in Ohio and there's a lot of discussion to have around that so is that part of the accountability so that we can see you know when kids go from a hospital to the police department\nYou know what's happening with those cases are the only thing that I Wonder about that is that's tracking the piece of evidence that's not maybe tracking what goes on with the cases and I think if there's not\nSome kind of accountability some kind of report out to the state once a year you know airport that says here's what happened with all the tested rape kits this many cases when forward that many cases that not and here's the reason that we won't really have a deeper understanding and be able to make better decisions um I Do know that some people think that there should be more training added at the state level\nI'm for police officers kind of from the beginning about these cases and then also for doing these types of investigations based on what's been learned um but I don't know what form that's going to take\nDutch thanks so much for the update and for the reporting on this radio show I think one of the things that proves that of a story dies if you don't stay on it and certainly you stayed on that now we see it going more state wide let's hope that the attention continues in these other communities to make so much for being with us\nRachel about as well with the big ... thank you for your expertise just want to thank you and always good to talk with you rebel from prosecutor's office appreciate it\nIf you would like to learn more about the topic we provided links to Rachel Dissell extensive reporting on the topic the ... center and the kind of the town of sexual assault just passed force on our show page you can find that that Idea Stream dot org slash ideas now want to take a quick break right now we come back we're going\nIn Ohio it's the sound of ideas on Mike McIntyre we're right back in\nA moment [noise]\nSupport for ... for three W CPS is provided by\nPlayhouse square welcoming the Tony Award winning musical Les Miserables heart of the key bank Broadway series Les Miserables returns October thirtieth through November Eighteen tickets at playhouse square dot org\nThe Cleveland hearing and speech center announcing the grand opening celebration from October fifteenth through the thirty first for their new Westlake office on center ridge road bringing evaluations and services to the west side to assist those struggling to hear speak read or write\nCleveland hearing and speech center accepts the variety of insurance is including some that covers hearing aids now accepting Westlake appointments that ca Jesse dot org\nPerfect to smile a group dental practice in Chagrin Falls providing patients an anesthesia free alternative to the traditional drill for hard and soft tissue procedures by using a dental laser new patients welcome perfect to smile dot com [noise]\nBack with us out of ideas from Ninety point three I'm Mike McIntyre times nine forty five AM for the past two weeks we've been bringing you end up interviews with the candidate seeking statewide office in November general election we've heard from the candidates for governor secretary of state attorney general an auditor as well as US Senate\nWe have asked them questions important to you and many of which were provided by you via social media\nWe conclude our candidate interviews with Republican Robert spray candidate for Ohio treasure this interview like the other interviews were pre recorded so we can I take live calls this segment we do however want to hear from you so send us an email asking why at\nW. A. C. P. N. dot org or tweet at San of ideas and were posting all the interviews as the heir to Idea Stream dot org slash election twenty Eighteen\nAsking as we did of each candidate why are you the best person for the job\nI think because of the experience that I bring to the table in the private sector finance that's particularly important in the treasures office hurting my financial skills at Ernst and young and the private sector working overseas and Hong Kong and Singapore my job essentially was to solve\nComplex financial problems for fortune five hundred companies and I want to bring that same ability inexperienced and put it to work for the taxpayers to the state of Ohio\nThe appeal of this office to you because I'm sure a lot of people who had been in politics and stuff would say that this is probably the lowest profile of all the the statewide elected offices why does this why does this job appeal to you\nWell I think because of my finance background a and also this is a job that matters um it's uh you're managing billions of dollars of state assets\nAre and you're issuing billions of dollars of debt so you're the interface between the private capital markets and the public sector for the state of Ohio it's a big job it's an important job and your job is to keep the taxpayer dollars safe on\nYou and Rob Richard Senate both talked about in expanding if you will the the role of the treasure in someone you know he talks about using the power pension funds to to drive public policy you've talked about something called social impact bonds how those work and it is that in your mind is are you sure that's a safe use of the states money well\nIt it's extremely safe use of the states money because you're only paying for programs that work better than what a you're already doing so let me give you an example of what the social impact upon does\nUh this is an innovative cutting edge financial tool that I'm going to bring to bear and the treasury office and essentially it says look right now for the heroin epidemic in the state of Ohio or treatment system gets very low recovery rates\nHow do we improve recovery rates we have eleven percent on average recovery rate in the state of Ohio for heroin addiction\nTalking with a you're a medical examiner earlier this\nAnd we've got to get more people into successful treatment I Believe that the private sector is able to create an innovative faster and so I Want to involve the private sector through the use of these social impact box okay here's how it works\nThe state says if you're in the private sector we're getting eleven percent recovery rates right now and the public sector we're willing to pay for forty percent of recovery rates why because it's going to save people's lives and it's also going to save the state money because we'll spend less money on Medicaid and children are protective services and the criminal justice system\nSo in the private sector if you're the gun foundation we'd love to have you take a risk an issue of ... million dollar bond to try new type of heroin treatment that works much better than what we're already doing\nTake that million dollar bond run a two year pilot program and will measure the results and was a third party Beloit or some other accounting firm come in and measure the results and if you're able to get that forty percent recovery rate or greater the state commits to buying back that bond at the end of the two year period plus interest\nSo it's a phenomenal innovative tool financial tool to involve the private sector on a hard to solve problems like the heroin epidemic the reality is we're already spending over a billion dollars on the heroin epidemic through treatment in the Medicaid system through hepatitis C which often accompanies\nA heroin user intravenous drug use through the criminal justice system through foster parents and the children to protect the services area you can use those savings to buy back the bond\nAnd the reason the one of the reasons that we have trouble with the treatment system is because financing what we are willing to pay for it through the Medicaid system dictates what the treatment system looks like\nAnd this model flips that on its head it's said instead of us dictating from the public sector a payment system and processes that you have to follow in order to get paid instead we're going to pay for results so you get us to their wrists", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "25"}
