there is one truth that has endured through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency he has kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House\n[noise] there's only one part in that finally someone that's not a politician and he's the scrutiny washing about [noise]\nApproval of these voters often light and often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has stayed loyal to Trump view Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump himself once famously said\nThis week on hidden brain re explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain\nThis is a group that feels belittled and ignored

white working class overcoming class ... in America Joan welcome to read and write\nDelighted to be here we've heard a lot about the white working class since that twenty sixteen election or I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within a median annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then the top ... their professional manager that elite is the top twenty percent by household income\nUm and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle ... fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages\nSince Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group have absolute be tanked I'm actually more recent\nStatistics have come out since the book and the most dramatic is that virtually all Americans born in the Nineteen forties did better than their parents virtually all but\nToday it's less than half and this is the group whose economic prospects has really collapsed\nAnd that's actually true not only in the u._s. it's true in advanced industrialized countries throughout the world a more recent study showed and that's one of the reasons you find this populous politics are rising in many places around the world not just the United states\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen this kind of hard living drug sex rock and roll\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] um\nSays working class people have come to a few but government benefits and government programs are not for them when her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Jones suggests\nWas oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they deliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption\nKnow it isn't her job to know that it's the job of the people who are designing programs and all the political elites to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nIs it the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and their outlook and people who are not so they're going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to the community in a way that's very different\nAnd in some ways they resent the people who are costs will politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but brags it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did I'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of our GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for brags it and for Trump results\nWho have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever they actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity\nIn contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange does your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\nWork it's what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups but the hard work is a matter of of of persevering\nAnd staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life um elites are completely defined\nBy their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nUm this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of sort of pathetic power\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many well to do people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out of the book Joan this idea is much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nGoing to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course coach that is what could tripled I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college uh many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that date they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nIf you give people an identical schools will record and one from an elite family in one from a a a white working class family the white working class family\nHas to kid has to actually be about three times as good as the elite family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says researchers sent out two sets of resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music uh Mr water polo\nEncourage all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway\nJoan Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame

large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show Marissa half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and the slack majority things are Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class these threats come in different forms [noise]\nCultural\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political track\nWhy do Republicans on the hill understand the threat of these policies posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift\nSituation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really\nTaken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have\nA central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou've also looked at what happens in states as the demographics of St start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters [noise] well what\nYou typically see is that as the population of a Latino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen election so [noise]\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... to the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was\nA political outcomes that we were exploring and so I think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently that political climate we live in today [noise]\n\nWhen we come back what Murray Sabra hunters thesis about a white

California San Diego she's the co author along with ... and ... of the book white backlash immigration race and American politics\nWhere your book came out of twenty Fifteen but as you said in many ways it anticipated the central issue and Donald Trump's presidential campaign\n[noise]\nAt the time were so many pundits that Trump was running a campaign that was out of touch with a diverse America but but um anyway as your book shows he was actually running a campaign that was perfectly in touch with the anxieties of white voters\nThat's right I think what Condon Smith says that Trump was in trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of\nEmotional appeals that are tied to a specific group of individuals that pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years in Obama presidency and so it's immigration\nAlso tied in with the issue of race and this is why the subtitle of our book is immigration race and politics because the two things ... they at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have eight years\nOf the presidency of the first African American person in this country coupled with\nAt the specific campaign message of immigration a altogether\nAnd pain and his presidency so\nOne one disturbing implication from your thesis Morris says we're heading to a situation where we have different political parties for people of color and people who are white or an an increasingly what this means is that our political devised become racial divide\nIndeed and that's a one of the ah again more pessimistic outcomes of this research is that really\nYou know race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society but I think also Republicans willingly took on that strategy and are using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting\nTensions here it seems to me for both the Democratic party and the Republican Party you know we we alluded to this sometime earlier but what might be in the interest of each party in the short term might not be in its interests in the long term can can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party in the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party right now they're an overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly\nA majority minority country that at some point that strategy is going to be short lived right so but again for the time being for the next five to ten years it works so I I I think their senses well let's just go with it right they're not looking further beyond\nTwenty Thirty years from now on the other hand the problem that Democrats faced is\nYes they're the most diverse party that more diverse than Republicans but one thing that they really are struggling with is that the voting behavior of voters of color different is a sense that so many of them are not engaged in the

featuring Troy Balderson and\nDanny O'Connor the Republican Troy Balderson one that by very a very very slim margin\nBut uh Danny O'Connor have been winning in the early vote and it was the election day boat that really got Troy Balderson over the finish line so to speak so\nIt really does come down to who turns out to vote and and whether you turned out earlier or the attorney general election day whichever side turns out the most voters is going to win which is you know a very simplistic thing to say but it's it's it's true\nWith you know a plus or a TV as pop up and last week or so even more so than we've been facing already um what was interesting yesterday is as they put in their final finance reports we see them like the one is no loaned his own jumping three million dollars at his own money purportedly to buy more to the ... the city that his word\nYeah I think it does mean that here to him I think is the the previous longer than a million and then those in the final day is

just I mean I think the the ad war was expected this is the most expensive governor's race in Ohio history together the candidate to brace forty four million dollars and it is interesting to see the wind loaning himself this is the second time\nOver Cordray at this point why would he have done that\nBut I think that there is a real thought of a final push a final advocates because like I just sat turning out people is the most important thing to winning an election and you've got to get that turn out and uh I I think that that's that's what you're going to say I think in the last couple of days here is\nBoth campaigns trying to make sure that they get their voters out\nAnd uh you know certainly looking at the blocks of voters that they think are most reliable and there's two walks voters that I think a lot of people talked about for instance um suburban women and when you start drilling down onto especially like steak house races that's where you really see some interesting things happening like in the central Ohio area\nAh you know Donald Trump won Ohio by eight points Hillary Clinton won some of these suburban districts that had been represented by Republican state lawmakers now they seem to be tipping torn in democratic state lawmakers\nAnd that's really kind of interesting and also people talk a lot about getting younger voters out to vote well the breakdown of the more than eight million registered voters in Ohio right now a ... you only have about\nTen percent less than ten percent of those people are in that Eighteen to twenty four year old bracket that younger voter brackets so you know a ... the question about whether those younger voters we always hear is that if this is going to be the election where they decide things that and that uh that number really say states than suggest but that's not the case\nYou mentioned the edge there which they love as probably a lot of as would be ... be misleading or just flooded out wall but nobody feeding the checks as much as we are the as\nYou know I Know you're going to see the the ... there's going to be a mess a barrage um yeah and in a shared portrayed as an abuser [noise] or even though you know that's largely for them to booked um but those races all limb to be attacked to observe fraud or did you see more doors and going\nSince her parents we expected it and we're getting a little ... and the other issue that I think you'll hear a lot from the Republican so to start to see somebody else already you know it was within the last push from from the wind but if it's the ticket wide thing is don't go back and trying to ... and the other Democrats\nTo up to ... who you know remains quite unpopular as as the Democrats phone to their chagrin two years ago when they thought he would have a very very strong candidate um\nBy pointing out all the difficulties of the state face in two thousand tuned without the course of the ... the students really not about to give you both sides went up to the entire country's economy was in a terrible decision in two thousand two and we were at the the new leader of a of of the river so\nYeah and I think obviously Democrats are going to keep trying to hit the issue of health care I mean every day it seems like Democrats are trying to do some sort of a vent whether it's with Cordray or somebody else on the ticket the specifically talks about\nWhat they feel is a Republican record on health care and they feel that Mike DeWine is vulnerable because he did on his first day in office and attorney general file a lawsuit against the Affordable care\nAct to whine who was on this week's edition of the state of Ohio are TV show ice and extended interview with him I specifically asked him about that and he said you know he filed a lawsuit based on his opposition to the individual mandate but that he's voted many times to support protection for people with preexisting conditions Democrats find that message\nTo be conflicting and they've been trying to really push that very hard the other thing I Want to say about ads is you know people complain about negative ads and say that they hate negative ads they want to hear ads talking about what a candidate will do not\nWhat the other candidate how bad the other candidate is negative ads work and that's why they're on the air I mean focus groups have shown over and over again that people do listen the negative ads and they will repeat things that they hear a negative ads some negative ads do work and the frustration\nWe were there for a low we go lower [laughter]\n... former is maybe largely United in their beliefs about were offered to Lake Erie but that was no match for what the governor of Ohio believe this would be ... department of agriculture says Daniels was on board with protecting would do it and then during two other high rise in the department members left as well what's the point\nWhere it comes what seems to be over\nHow to deal with algae blooms and Lake Erie and I think the governor has been very concerned about the way that the legislature has been handling this he signed an executive order in July that would tighten rules on fertilizer and nutrient runoff\nGoing into the streams that go into lake area and and his real concern is that there wasn't enough being done to try to deal with that but he felt like a legislature wasn't taking enough action farmers have come back and said hey we're concerned that that's going to affect\nOur work really significantly and they put a lot of pressure and raise concerns on David Daniels the head of the Ohio with the former had the department of agriculture\nWho I talked to earlier this week saying that he was very surprised that he was called into the governor's office a week ago today and told that his services were no longer need any served at the pleasure the governor and and he didn't he didn't he didn't need to come to work anymore and that's really interesting with only two months left\nUntil case it leaves office that that was a choice that he had made but there's also another committee out there and I'm going to have to look this up here the sub committee of the soil and water conservation commission\nThey've been meeting on this as well and the same division seems to exist in this group the division over what do we do in terms of what farmers want versus what the governor field is appropriate to try to deal with these algae blooms\nAnd that's going to come up I think next month that commission is going to foot put out a report and and really discuss what they feel the impact of the executive\nShort time knowing that this record rivers to the one could change it\nWell there is an interim a director of agriculture to embarrassing as a former state representative he was immediately sworn in that role but other than that no I mean like I said that there's two months left and so if you have a lot of\nA transition going on with the governor's office right now because he is indeed getting ready to leave office in early January and and so you got people you know moving on but\nWhen I talk to David Daniels I asked him if he was surprised and he said yes he thought he was going to last at the end of the governors term and so he was he was very surprised but it was clear that he feels that there was some real conflict over this issue of farm run off and algae blooms in lake area and the governor's executive order\nKaren ... was fired and the state of the case that Saturday and maybe when it when he talked with a donor talk to you talked about in this time of transition I mean this is ... realistic hope\nThat division ... whether it's rules or something like that\nThis would force the next governor to have to overturn or or to rethink me what do you really would have been really think they can accomplish in ... was was because there was two months to do\nWell I think what's really key is you've got a lame duck legislation session coming up and whoever wins the governor's office I think that's going to potentially dictate what's going to happen in terms of legislation that comes forward in that final month in December December could potentially be a really really busy month\nFor lawmakers because they will know who they're dealing with in terms of who was going to be the next governor Richard Cordray or Mike DeWine and so I think case it can wander to set in place some\nMotions that indeed if it is Mike DeWine who said this week that he was going to vote for that there'll be certain things that would already be in ... in process\nI I'm not really sure how a witch\nIt this is a great piece of evidence it's a great lead but you have to be willing to do the fall of work and I think one of the things that that Rachel in many other reporters and sort of a of sort of volunteers who helped found because they took these questionnaires\nHey if you were doing social science research is you know it's really a pretty remarkable return it gives you a nice cross section of the state and how few people are and you find the same thing nationally\nThere are jurisdictions national he would have had tested thousands of rape kits and ... and and and it's in single or low double digits a number of followers cases\nYou really have to change your mentality you have to be willing to see this is ... to ... to look for the linkages between these cases it takes all it takes a different mentality and I don't think necessarily can legislate that\nYou have to train that into your police into your prosecutors you have to redefine what you think your um research necessary resources are because one of the things that the Cuyahoga County task force found out relatively early\nWas it it's really important to involve advocates from the very beginning because a lot of the people who you are going to approach and say hey we found some evidence member that evidence you gave us from your attack Fifteen Years ago or Eighteen years ago\nHey we're gonna wait we finally we got the results back now and we'd like to follow up on it to people have gone through hopefully have gone through some kind of healing process or at least they've tried to\nCompartmentalize her wall off that portion of their life and you're asking to walk back into that room or they have received such a resentment against the the the police against the justice system which didn't give them any justice so there's the the resources and neither do very different than just hey we've got unavailable detective who can look at this and that we kind of thought maybe\nThat guy was in some cases you have spouses chosen maybe even parents who never knew about this incident and the first place and now you're asking them to bring that to an entire family right could the attorney general's office big for it and just investigate on their own\nThat's a good question um you know they they do have the ability but typically the way they operate is they will they they need to work with a local jurisdiction on a on a particular set of you know even even when they do like a corruption case\nThe gators to the press all say certainly 'cause I mean that's what that's one of the reasons the Cuyahoga County worked so well is there has been there was great support from from Mike DeWine office in terms of assigning I'm I'm\nAbout Ohio State investigators to to work with a task force which also included the ah the Cleveland public a Cleveland Police department\nAnd the coyote county sheriff's office as well as much grant money that uh the county was able to obtain from both state and the federal government to hire more investigators but you know that's a big operation that was set up and continues to operate the task force\nAnd as we see both of men who are running for governor right now used to be the attorney general you can tell that from all the commercials are they're going to pay close attention to what's going on with the new age as a as a place of his case\nWhere you would hope so and I think both attorney general says have all the candidates are further trades I'll have have recognized that\nThat this has in terms of ... raising this issue and and and trying to right or wrong the the one of the things that might the winds down right on the way it is you know is is doing this testing in may and encouraging everybody and then kind of keeping this issue front and center\nYeah even though it took years they worked on it did look\nMoving on a priest with local ties was put on leave this week by church leaders in Parma after an accusation of sexual misconduct with a minor the byzantine Catholic upper ... of ... says the alleged incident happened thirty five years ago while the priest denies the allegations still the church place while they're able to go on leave because the week out\nAnd because he did falsely reported an attack recently claiming he was beaten outside in Indiana church by unknown assailants when we said talk of crimes by priests\nChurch leaders say the attack never actually occurred Christ is Bruce wasn't currently serving in Ohio\nWith the suspension and will ensure he can't go to another church in another part of the country and continue\nYes I mean they're they're continuing to investigate the pending that yes he cannot do that um we don't really know a lot about the incident then that precipitated this book but he\nA who's who later became a vote for him and they said we don't have the evidence the wacky thing was the claim of the attack or because they went and interviewed as family members and finally said you just didn't happen I'm so she's clearly feeling some pressure to kind of create a drummer and himself\nSo where does it go from here just a they continue to investigate and at some point\nThey were when it comes down yeah my reading of it is that this isn't final it's just wild they continue down this path he's unable to serve in any capacity and it's you know it was a local story and served in Ohio and flip it it's a local story because the center of the churches and part of\nA bigger picture of course it is all churches are looking at their priest in their pastors and say\nYou know something must be done this is one more coming out of the woodwork\nWill continue on a new federal auto show in Ohio was medicated department is paid millions of dollars for the ... ... why I'm going to deny the climate is appealing the ought to guard with Medicaid department's argument here\nWell Medicaid department is saying that basically the the the way that the sample was done that you know these payments were sampled and then extrapolate it out\nIs is not right that they haven't been paying for medical payments to dead people but there's still a question about what happened to that money there's about thirty eight million dollars and the federal government says oh back to them that they said went out to the managed care company is for payment for these people and and they're concerned about this\nMedicaid is now looking into this and say they they were they want to appeal\nAnd and so it's just a it's really a dispute over numbers it seems like between the numbers that are in the federal water versus what Ohio medicated saying is going on but Medicaid is a very clear and that they are not paying medical payments for dead people that are nearly a year ago they they've looked into their process and and there's there's no\nWell ... we die but the bills continue to come in and put it into the hospital proceed you lose your bills for six months and the bills continue to come and then the look and they said well a person with them and we paid the bill and image of seemed to work and so therefore you would think that there will be safeguards in place that doesn't\nCome up journalism and\nBut I think I think the process is you know the uh the payments are made to Medicaid or to uh\nTo Medicaid service providers these these these ah\nManaged care companies that work with Medicaid and you know there have been some concerns raised about the timeliness in which ah the payments have gone back and forth and and how you know for instance Medicaid managed care company or a the managed care companies insurance companies that work with the state\nHow quickly they've been paying providers there's been a lot of providers who said that they have not especially in the uh you have your house space who said they have not gotten payment as quickly as they were expecting it and they've\nKind of been in a cash crunch ... cash crunch because of it so I think that there's a real question about\nHow this works and how the money actually gets moved along so timing is is I think an issue\nIf the money was paid an error medicated recover\nA good question I mean I think that now they're looking at the ... the the whole audit here and you know this is the kind of way that audits apparently are done that a certain payments are pulled out samples and then it's kind of a\nBroad and out to the whole wider population Medicaid's actually done that with some of its own providers and said hey we sampled some of the payments that you made and we found they weren't air and so we'd have strap pointed that out we would like a finding of recovery for this much\nAnd now there are a little bit concerned the federal government is is that in terms of what they're doing in terms of managing these payments but uh yeah I mean I think this is that there's a lot of questions about what's going on Medicaid Medicaid is a huge part of the state budget\nNot Medicaid and and the actual patients and and so I think there's some some real questions about what happens to all the money that goes into Medicaid from the federal government and in the state level where does it all go and and who is actually getting\nWe will stay with the health field now for this next story a new study from the Cleveland Clinic it found that personal in activity is worse than smoking a direct result of the study examined data from patients between Nineteen Ninety One and twenty four\nPatients who were unfit on a treadmill or an exercise stress test had worse ... than being hyper tens of diabetic or current smokers course maybe we should do the show standing up for now\nI Know this is this is a big\nDeal right because they did over a hundred and twenty thousand people um you know a lot of northeast Ohio and at the center of this and and it's not questionnaires they put 'em on a treadmill and if they could only go four minutes they were put in the lowest category and then they had people go as long as they could and the people\nThat went long lived it for a much longer time and they found that the beating unfit is three times worse for you in terms of mortality than smoking I mean and what the other thing that was cool is the older you get\nThe more the the benefit is people who are Seventy or older who are in the most fit area had the most benefit and we're going to live the longest time and you know it's based right here it's I mean these ... this is Ohio which is so we know what we need to do\nIn their underwear sedentary state two and a lot of ways\nWe are I I I Love the euphemism to introduce a story with personal inactivity I like that [laughter] but I thought one of these new findings too with some point there are some doctors have thought that you might be able to overdo it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "26"}
