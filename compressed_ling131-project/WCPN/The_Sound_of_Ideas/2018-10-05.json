as well that's not exactly\nHow I was feeling [noise] change this thing is there was a truly a collaborative effort the results of that collaboration take the stage this weekend we have a preview tomorrow afternoon with thirty three Ninety point trees hearing now featuring the sound of applause\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and this is hidden brain\nIs brandy ... I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and that\nIs the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions so pay attention to your own Randy is now in her late thirties a few years ago her life unraveling at the time she around the dining services department at a senior living facility she'd been with the company that ran it for more than a decade one day\nShe made a mistake has just in a rush to get home that was our because daycare closeted and say I get off at five\nAnd it's like maybe ten mile drive ...\nBefore I picked the baby up around these stopped at a store run in and grab the diapers she's swipe took credit card at the self checkout station and reached out\nIt turns out she used the wrong card not her own by the company credit card\nBut what's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment I didn't realize until my supervisor climb in and said hey what's this purchase so had she not said anything I don't think I Would have\nRealized that run to carry the card and kiss you needed to buy dining supplies or what should never had a problem before never be reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do in her response was well you know we have\nTo determine nature and I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only what twelve but [noise] and she said now in cases like that you automatically after terminate them play\nAnd just cried and cried like a day because I couldn't believe it I didn't want to go home and tell my\nKids what had happened and I didn't want to tell my husband what an Avon I just didn't know what to do at that point I felt like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example even though\nIt was a mistake brandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she felt like a loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stress grew Randy and her husband began fighting\nHad supported him when he'd been laid off a few years earlier and she'd expected he'd do the same for her but he felt his situation was different he'd been laid off brandy was fired he was mad that she'd made\nTheir job interviews I had two interviews that day and I didn't purchase toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet paper\nWhen I came in with the kids who just immediately started yelling you can't keep yourself together you can't do this you can't do that so I walked\nRight back out the door and I never looked back\nWithout steady employment and her husband to help with bills Randy watching anxiously as her household supplies dwindled and she worried constantly about money\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you buy two carriers will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework till ... of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJustice the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the\nFriends they do not have the result is they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't be attention to what's actually being set the conversation falter\nInstead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward slack for what happens as a result people avoid the aqua conversationalist and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lens offers a new way of thinking about white people who\nFind themselves in scarcity seem to do things that to an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole\nBut if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty make everyone less capable that it's the it's it's you and I tomorrow what are we to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect that poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some bleeding ... theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and learn ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich so how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers\nActually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich but like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest\nPoor in a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next central and now that are tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read their feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short term thinking\nA scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test put simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experience\nOn Sundays we get to leave that for pm some days we don't leave till one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty six in the morning usually work eighty hours a week\nWhen we come back we'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form of scarcity\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and you're listening to hidden brain from NPR\nSupport for ...

tell you the story of a young woman named Katie she asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note card if there was a holiday party I bought the new cards and I also studied until two or three in the morning\nGT says she wanted to be perfect at school she

I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so I come home\nAfter pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I'd read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise\nThan like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours walking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working Fifteen hours a day and and trying to read and then go to sleep\nAnd uh she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success Judy lost sight of things on the periphery [noise]

it was stressing me how [laughter] it was just a mess\nAnd um I've my clothes piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes and coming home just so overwhelming I didn't want to be there and that's part of\nI think why I was walking so much just to get out of the house and get away from all the things they haven't done an ounce of forgot to pay a bill in the mix of all of this\nWhat did you forget to do what did you forget\nFalling apart at Johnson I was I was falling apart\nIt turns out that having too much you can have its own set of problems when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the

business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nOr strategy become a wealth manager [noise] roof discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers none aloft about the private lives of their clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n... welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions then usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing it to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's\nSome activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nThere can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets preferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSuicide already interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you've conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of person becomes wealth manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nSo you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack him around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to ...\nLines once called her from outside a restaurant in London telling me that story so this is one of the first\nStories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom my clients who lives in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix a problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are some times ah clients do make request like this not because we're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that the client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said no I'm I'm your wealth manager not your fish monger and the client said well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he\nAcross from a Japanese fellow who wanted ... thousands ... smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any questions\nOne thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they're not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and wait what children just like you know everybody else\n... but ... you argue ... compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or a parent will ask the wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes the the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family the big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues\nThe lawsuit process and many countries ... public many many private documents that would reveal the extent ... nature of the family's wealth olive which has had been carefully guarded secrets\nLike yesterday is a sociologist Brooke Harrington [noise]\nShe spent years trying to understand the lives of people who are still well see

news of the week Chris quoting the editor of Cleveland dot com Joe folic whose idea streams managing producer of community affairs and from our studios in Columbus Idea Stream statehouse bureau chief Karen ...\nAnd we begin this week with a numerical puzzle\nIt was on Tuesday that we set an an enviable record for the sixth consecutive year there have been more than a hundred homicides in the city of Cleveland and other deaths in the city sense are under investigation murder is not unusual topic for the sound of ideas but these numbers are disturbing and deserve our attention\nChristmases ongoing deadly violence that no one believes mayor's office multiple peace groups around the city seemed to be able to get a hand on\nWe hadn't had a stretch like this since before Nineteen Ninety six I mean we've we've reached a hundred earlier than previous couple of years so we're\nWe're not on a good a good path you know the prevalence of guns on on the street has been something we have talked about on the show in the past and and there is nothing out there that stops at I mean all of the efforts the municipalities have tried to use\nTo restrict the flow of guns into the hands of criminals in town had been blocked by by the legislature they won't allow cities like Cleveland or do anything about it [noise] um what what you're also seeing is ah in the Washington Post that huge survey the fifty biggest cities recently\nThat there aren't enough detectives to me that that that the set number of homicides any detective should investigate any or should be no more than five many of these cities it's eight last year in Cleveland it was an average him nine or they have fourteen homicide detectives and\nSpecialty in his time will be dealing with violent crime and so they'd geared up some things I think they have some other planes will be announcing soon\nThat take game trying to to prevent some of this violence and solve some of these there is a general feeling that the people who do the shooting do a lot of shooting and so if you can get one of them off the street you can do a lot to prevent future violence and that's where they're failing right\nNow and make a lot of points there oh let's go to the part about the fourteen homicide detectives because right now they have a fifty percent clearance rate but fourteen as you say is way too few on the streets fifty percent is fairly no matter where you go to school but it's not nearly the detectors for\nAnd it's you know if that's a national issue I mean you almost any big urban area you want to go to the jail is as a result of the institutionalization some other things Chris just mentioned the jail has become the fact of the Disney largest mental health is all it is it is the largest\nUm drug treatment facility in any given ... you know that's not what jails are supposed to be it's also\nRight now because the economy is roaring hard to hire people for joke because if you don't have to work and in jail\nYou won't and and the economy has plenty of jobs\nThey talked about a second set of recommendations coming but recommendations we know it takes time to study time to implement these deaths are coming on an average of ... eleven days we really can't wait\nFor recommendations well they are scrambling to fill those ranks the not getting all of the city guards did set the counting back in an unexpected way they had done a lot of planning for when this merger took place but they didn't see that coming okay\nLet's move on less than one month now until election day less than one week into early voting

governor which polls show perhaps the closest to the races\nAnd which offers a stark contrast and some of the positions held by Democrat Richard Cordray on Republican Mike DeWine several aspects to cover here carrying costs are but let's start with what happens Monday the final debate between the two moderated by you being hosted by Cleveland State university what do we look for\nI Will be moderating as you just mentioned I and I will be joined by two other questionnaires\nThat's at the CBS affiliate and we'll be having\nKind of a roundtable discussion at a roundtable on capitalism State University talking about variety of issues and uh we're taking questions in at the Ohio debate commissions website Ohio commission dot org\nAnd we'll have our own questions as well for both candidates and it should be a really good opportunity to hear from them one last time on the issues that haven't been asked about yet and the other two debates you haven't seen the ones in Dayton in Marietta well this is the third installment and we're really trying to to come up with things that people want to know about that they haven't been asked about\nRace was will notable for all the other interests of the most money in a gubernatorial races throughout history thirty eight million dollars between the two what runners are there still time before you can do together more where's all this money going\nWell I think it was pretty obvious going into this this is going to be the most expensive\nGovernor's race in Ohio history I mean\nThat it compares to John ... and Ted Strickland back in twenty ten and when you had Mike DeWine and John cue said we're both running on their own when they came together and they each had four million dollars coming together and that really kind of set a tone I think here and then Richard Cordray had a lot of outside influence in terms of his\nJob at the CSP the consumer financial Protection Bureau\nI think that that brought some money and as well\nAnd so I think that this ... and of course the fact that Ohio is the first time\nSince uh two thousand six that we have this opportunity to elect not only a governor but also the other for a statewide executive officers attorney general ... secretary of state and treasure and and some of those positions are on the portion that board was draws the line for state houses they set of districts there's a lot of things all wrapped up here\nAs well as the U.S Senate race there was going to be a lot of attention on Ohio\nAnd so with this race really being close so both the wine and Cordray are close in polling and they're fairly close in fundraising at least in monthly total but there just isn't enough time at this point for Cordray to ...\nThere isn't enough time I don't think ... recorded really completely catch\n... and the point ... this data on on that with regard to the money ... remember a lot of that that's total money into campaign the one hand there ... much more competitive primary our eyes than than than quarter ... certainly felt that he had a much more compact so I think he had a\nWas in the race longer and he's had he had yet you also had to spend a lot in the primary was court are really good and\nThere's a lot of fire between these guys we had um in uh yesterday um and we pretty much had appeal of a part of it I I just something happened I've never seen before\n... twice ... and the winds armed to restrain them I'm thinking what would happen if that were female candidate um [laughter] I mean did you just don't see it and they were I mean they just would not stop going ... each other the fire between them ... this debate ought to be interesting on\nYeah Adam and you're and you're building yesterday they were here in this building as well yesterday for another event Joe you were ... witness to that\nThese men have stark differences\nWell they do I mean they they they they put the world together very differently they're very good represent ... representative in that way of of their parties are and whether it's a you know\nWhether it's health care whether it's issue one there are you know just almost down the line ... education these are you know they're they're very very different um they've run against each other before there was a lot I think there were ... bad blood for two thousand and ten it certainly hasn't uh\nIt's clear that have happened to hasn't gone down and anyway so ... and the stakes are very high\nWe had discussed fall through the primary season kind of the lackluster\nThe quality of course ... campaign there wasn't much going on he's a completely different candidate in this general election he is he's he is on top of his issues he's viewed Joes right there's ... there's big differences and he he's ... articulating those very very aggressively um and so it was like the one I mean they're they're punching\nWe've talked before about the idea that endorsements don't mean now look\nThe governor's race or were you surprised at all\nWell I think the endorsements are coming in for Cordray but like you said I I'm not sure what endorsements mean endorsements are coming in against issue one and that's an issue that quarter hasn't backing\nSo I'm not sure how people are reading those things one thing that's an interesting here is you know we talked for a while about how boring this campaign could potentially be that those these guys are nerds and all that kind of stuff\nBut I think what's showing is that both of these gentlemen have wanted to be governor for a long time that had a lot of time to think about this and a lot of time to think about what they would want to do and now that it's close I think they're getting very that they're passionate showing in the end their ideas as if they're trying to express them that that ah\nThat fire is really coming out and so I I think that people who might have looked away from this campaign thinking now you know these guys are are ...\nThey are because they care about policy but they're also really passionate about what they want to do and and they do come at this job from very very different perspective\nAnd that some of what we're going to explore and the debate coming up on Monday\nIt wasn't so I thought was interesting about the the dispatch endorsements in the store destroyed endorsement if\nHe was like I I ... was it or they have an impact and I always I always enjoy that got us all\nWords but was there was part of their rationale if you look back to last time that\nBut the dispatch under the middle ... different ownership endorsed a Republican or a ... a Democrat for do there was two thousand six you know that time that was ... over a Ken Blackwell Blackwell was perceived as maybe outside of the Republican mainstream at the time\nLike the wind is clearly in that line of Republican mainstream the the you know the the tree of George Voinovich and Bob Taft and John Case took him to kinds of people who have one in the state\nAnd one of the things that they said though was they're concerned about the state legislature but the wind would not rein in a Republican rung legislature that they needed that they're one of the big ...\nIt makes his final arguments pushes on that because sometimes people\nWhether they consciously or not do kind of like the balance I mean oftentimes you'll see I think that's why there's a push back to where there's been with us we didn't do well congressional in republic people tend to life\nThey don't like power consolidated into one part so that may actually be some sort of helps which quarter in the last ones here\nAnd he is doing a one of his big arguments is this governor will be in the room for redistricting is like the ones to go you will have the same legislature for the next fourteen years if he's the guy who made sure we finally get some balance back in the legislature done with\nNow Ohio's rules on redistricting were changed uh in the in may so that there is at least I think for many people some hope that there will be some different ways of drawing lines but the point is still there's a lot of concern there's not a\nNational democratic group that Eric Holder the former attorney general was involved in as been looking at Ohio specifically for the idea of redrawing\nThe congressional district lines as well as I think the state house districts lines as well\nBut uh you know you mentioned the last time a that a Democrat was endorsed by the Columbus dispatch again under different ownership and it was Ted Strickland when he ran against Ken Blackwell like you said that was the fifth biggest blowout in Ohio history when it came to the final results\nSo you know I'm not in any way saying that that's what's happening here in fact I think it's going to be very close it's going to be between you know two and ten points I think which is where most\nGovernors races do fall but I think once again the idea that both of these guys want to be governor they've wanted it for a long time and as you know a little over a month away and it's so close I think it's really firing them up and and potentially firing up\nTheir supporters and that's really what's going to matter when you talk about ah the legislature I mean Republicans have a super majority in the house and Senate the Senate is not likely change significantly but the house\nWhere the Republican is leaving and the Republican who wants to succeed that Republican may not do so well and and so that could the possibility that the governor is going to still have a Republican legislature is there but maybe not a super majority and and it may be actually we're very close\nWant to look at every single the the charge because universities during the tuition free time um have have used them to use to try and recover their money\nBut but there are people in in academia saying okay you know you were expanding our student body we have a tuition freeze worked it we're expanding our programs that's not sustainable\nWe have to come up with some way to fund this and that's what's lacking from this report as they didn't tackle increasing Ohio's contribution to higher ed and as we've talked about on this show\nCompared to all of the surrounding states we are far far behind in unless we really tackle that we're not going to change the couch funding formula Ken's waiting to dive and go as\nWell yeah across the country at state aid to colleges and universities increase ever only one point three percent last year Ohio has actually decreased it was the smallest decreased but it decreased by\nPoint one percent so yeah it it's really hard for colleges and universities to say that they're going to do all the things that they are going to do in terms of of investing in these high tech programs and and all these projects that they want to get done with less state aid coming in unless they raise tuition but then on the other side parents\nAnd people on the outside look and say hey wait a minute why should it costs as much money why\nHave these costs escalated over the years and if indeed the economy is so tied to people getting educations and and becoming you know getting good jobs with those education's why in the world shouldn't there be more state aid to school and so that's that's it's it's a really difficult problem and\nYeah the this panel has some suggestions here but uh this is the problem that a lot of other states are facing but Ohio's college costs I think anybody is send a kid to college you know I Will tell you they're just astronomical it seems like\nAnd you know this is the show's unfortunately\nA bipartisan gr was they were incapable of dealing with the the elephant in the room which was as if care and first of all time which is this the the level of state aid\nYou know at some point you know if I care and said if you believe this is the future of the economic future is having the educated workforce we have this\nYou know we had this seminar here yesterday this forum were both gubernatorial candidates talked about how important it post secondary education is to the ... to the future of the state we should point out they were talking to young people write a sixteen twenty six basically and we but we don't want to invest it we're not investing in the same corn\nBut it it it was such an unlikely thing they just said yeah we're not going to tackle that I mean it was just a few ... also let's not go there\n... there there's so much that can be said here we've got to move on thank you for\nThe Cleveland Catholic diocese says it plans to release the names of priests accused of child sex abuse including names of those accused prior to two thousand to also be adding them to a website that diet has maintained since that year website has the names of priests removed from assignments due to child sex abuse allegations\nCleveland sizes joins three others in Ohio committing to release a list of names but it was comes after a Pennsylvania grand jury of course that report on sex abuse and institutional cover ups in that state's died this Joe the recent wave of transparency just the way of trying to help the churches image after the news came out about sex abuse\nWell I think they realize that um you know they have a huge problem with both the general public but even with the people in the pews and that one of the things that they need to become more transparent\nThey have as you said since two thousand two had this website where they um where they post the names of priests who've been removed from a from the from from the clergy for for abuse\nIf you go there I think there are maybe twelve or Fifteen um entries over the course of Fifteen sixteen years um there's not a lot of information about those cases um and so they're they almost what what's posted there almost leaves more questions\nTransparent about who they're who who are who they were credible allegations against when the church learned about them and what the church did about them because it in some ways right now that's the big issue within the church that was the big issues seem to me in the in the Pennsylvania report which was\nOnce the hierarchy knew that there was an accusation what did they do did they just move from one place to another\nDid they or did they actually throw them out and did they go to the authorities how do they handle it that's the big question and we'll have to see what exactly they're willing to put forward for\nFor perspective on what a reversal that says there was a big investigation back in the late nineties early to thousands into the church a grand jury investigation and the church did everything it could to prevent\nThat information from coming out then what happened here is a core Schaffer after the Pennsylvania issue came up he wrote a story and reminding people of what happened back then and the church reached out to say hey\nI just want to let you know we're going to be doing this now that the main but the difference in transparency then transparency now as profound as Joe said what the what they put up but they did everything they could to prevent us from getting a hold of this information Fifteen sixteen years ago\nYou know in in that one they did have the fact that you know grand jury a findings in general are are are sacred and but\nYou they could release what they heard over to the greater the court can't release what the grand jury collective necessarily that's you know that's a whole that's a huge legal barrier but\nJust like anybody goes in testifies can walk out and say hey I said this right they can say look these are the documents like in Pennsylvania how many hundreds of thousands of pages that they were were they that they collect by subpoena they can say this is how we answered the speed in this is what we turned over there I mean there\nWere a whole bunch of cases and as I recall only one priest was charged in that case but there were a bunch of people discuss\nI Would bet he would have people certainly coming forward I mean that's been the certainly the experience and in Pennsylvania is many names as they had uh in in that report\nThey you know they basically right as soon as they did they set up phone lines or continue to write with people saying hey this is what this is my story and this is what happened to me\nThe compensation and those things tend to run into you know the big problem is is our statute of limitations issues come is that\nYou mentioned earlier the image of the church being struck down or people not attending services the way they did in Fifteen Twenty years ago\nWell there were lots of reasons they weren't ... they did fifty under Twenty years ago before this happened but I think it's definitely hurt I mean I Know I Know some folks have\nBasically stopped going and stopped contributor or putting their contribution limit or something else maybe they're giving him directly to the St Vincent DePaul society or to um you know there's some other down in some other on whether you're a worthy cause\nBanks are government watchdog group reported this week that some Ohio Supreme Court justices are recusing themselves when hearing cases involving campaign contributors\nYour organization's common cause ... and most of these cases the judges are eventually ruling in favor of these donors judicial raises of course in Ohio and non partisan bickering that seems like a conflict of interest certainly is it legal\nWell first of all there's a lot of money and Supreme Court races and I think that's something that a lot of people might not know about I mean the candidates for Supreme Court there four major party candidates and they're like you said it's a nonpartisan they raise nine hundred thousand dollars and a through August ... that's a lot of money and so the common cause report really kind of focus is on what happens\nIs those in in situations where judges do raise money and then they go on to be elected to the court and what happened in the cases in which some of their donors appeared before them and that there's a real concern here about accepting money from donors that might potentially\nThere are cases that come before the court and and it just really focuses on the difficulty that there is with regard to judicial race funding I mean\nThe groups that give to candidates running for judicial offices all across the board are groups that tend to come before those entities and so it's it's just it's really challenging but the group that had to suggestions first of all in these dark money ads where it's unclear who the donors are\nThat are candidates really should require and ask\nFor disclosure of the donors are those dark money candidates and also when the opportunity does come to recuse themselves they shouldn't do that to get rid of any parents have a friday\nAnd and these are these are challenging things I think but it does bring up the issue which common cause of talked about for a while there's a lot of money in Ohio spring weren't races and Supreme Court cases and other states as well and there's potentially problems look what's happening in West Virginia where the entire Supreme Court in West Virginia is being impeached\nIt's not just those who come before with cases I imagine some bar association lawyers also donate to the judges who can eventually have to stand in front of\nAbsolutely I mean I understand but where the money comes from tends to be from people who know the judges that they're going to be dealing with and and so it just it's just natural\nThat this would happen but it it really does send a kind of a sticky message here when there isn't recusal or when there might be concerned about how a justice or a judge would rule and so it it's it's a problem\nTom and calls broke down the road you know this is a fun day or the other four candidates with severe
