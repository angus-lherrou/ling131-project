that basic to the point question\nCouple of things that I'm passionate about elections or in this is of course the office which serves as Ohio's chief elections officer it's also the place for any new business starts and I come from a family that owns a small business and I'm I'm\nPassionate about or that work or whether it was ... years ago when this Italian immigrant my great grandfather started his family business or whether it's here in Cleveland today where there's a woman who's going to start her business that starts at the secretary of state's office so that's something that to me\nIs really remarkable that's where people start to live their American Dream by becoming an entrepreneur or on the election side I get to see people vote for the first time in places like Iraq and Kosovo risking their lives to do it\nNeed or unfair elections for the people the state just to clarify you mentioned you saw people have their right to vote for the first time in those countries\nYou were there as a part of the military yeah so I served in uniform for ten years and I tell the story out on the campaign trail about the purple fingers in Iraq when they when they vote they dip their finger and purple nc and that keeps people from voting twice simple technique\nOf that purple finger became so much more it was kind of like their I voted today sticker or they would come and take a selfie with it and show it to everybody it was also a real badge of courage for them because the terrorist organizations the Iranian backed terrorists groups that we were ... with on a nightly basis\nUm you know a political or talking points and talk about let's put something in place were Ohioans can be confident that those list are kept accurate will the same time we don't inconvenience people\nI'm six years of inactivity and one noticed sent to the home\nOr is the current process or if if that's not long enough then let's look at eight years or something like automatic voter registration by the way to a automated voter registration will will help to to make that unnecessary using the national change of address database will make it unnecessary to remove people from the voting rolls because you mentioned that the voting rights act\nIt also requires the states to maintain accurate roles that's part of that of that legislation a state law also requires the same\nGoing back Thirty years whether it was secretary of state Sherrod Brown or secretary of state Ken Blackwell or Bob Taft or Jennifer Brunner or or the current secretary of state they've they've all conducted what's called the supplemental process for removing inactive voters from the voter rolls\nAre there still has to be something in place to do that but we can do better than what's currently uh in in law in state of Ohio what I'd like to do is start working early next year as the new secretary of state with members of the legislature Republicans and Democrats to put it better process in place\nSo that we can maintain accurate roles without inconvenienced Ohioans I've shown a track record of being able to do that working across the aisle has been my ... ah during the the seven and a half years I spent in the legislature almost every bill I've ever pass has been bipartisan\nTalks about gerrymandering sort of a lack of competitive districts do to gerrymandering certainly suppresses the vote\nMechanism for how these districts will be drawn what do you think of that and does that solve the problem yeah so I think it's a it's a it's a great step I'm\nListening when I got to the legislature in two thousand eleven one of the first things I did was pair up with a group of ah Democrats and Republicans we formed a group of four of us to propose a bipartisan redistricting reform proposal you should have heard the scorn that I got from my own party at the time\nWhy the heck would you do this little roses leave well enough alone redistricting has been to our advantage politically or my answer to all of them was I didn't come to Columbus to do what's good for a party\nI came to to Columbus to to do what's best for Ohioans and so we've pushed to that and over seven years I I pushed for resisting reform ah sometimes I was I felt like I was the lone voice in the wilderness thanks to groups like the league of women voters and the Ohio environmental council and common cause Ohio and others\nThat went to the streets with clip boards and gather tens of thousands of signatures we were able to get the legislature to act in ... we've passed issue one was Seventy five percent supportive Ohioans\nAre what that means is we have a much better process in place now what that means is that the next census is two thousand twenty two thousand Twenty one we draw a new district lines it's going to be a seven member commission that's responsible for drawing state legislative lines\nIt will likely be that saying in my opinion that same seven member commission that has a role or or draws the congressional districts as the secretary of state I Will be one of the members of that seven member commission ... here's what that means though\nWhat we've required in issue on both the one that was passed this may and the one that was passed a couple of years ago is compromise compromise is not a dirty word despite what you here in Washington right now compromise is how states men and women solve problems in our form of government this process for drawing new district lines and\nHard but it's essential that we do it I came from a a line of work in the army during my ten years in uniform where we work together as a team because our lives depended on it that's the same perspective that I bring to the work that I Do today and I look forward to be a part of that\nWe haven't talked about business 'cause most of what a secretary of state does is elections and that's been most of our conversation but both you and your opponents say you want to use this office to improve the environment for business and in Ohio\nReally the secretary of state's office was a place where you filed paperwork so how can the place where people work has filed and be a place that encourages\nFederal business well and first of all that paperwork filing is not a trivial matter is you know uh it's got to be done right we've got to embrace folks when they started a new business here in Ohio like I said whether it was my great grandfather eighty years ago that started our family business or whether it's a woman here in ... county that's going to start her business\nAt the secretaries website that needs to be a trouble free experience and it doesn't always have to be\nAccepting paperwork either by the way I I think that that are there may be an opportunity to embrace some exciting technologies like black chain or to move into the future and move business filings onto a black chain protocol for how they they operate\nBut what the secretary of state has the opportunity to do is be the voice for entrepreneur it'd be the voice for small business within state government is a state level constitutional officeholder that is where all businesses start\nAnd so one of those ideas that I have for example\nA is to bring business courts back in Ohio and it provides that expertise when you're bringing a complex business matter before the court\nThat you can go to a judge that has the expertise to to to help you get that a fairly result uh another thing is regulatory reform one example that I'm working on right now is to sever this tie that exists between state agencies that charge fines and that state agencies budget so right now of an agency charges you a fine for noncompliance with something\nThey get to keep the money now they may not be over enforcing in order to pad their budget\nJust one example of you know if something nobody thought of over the years but we're trying to get done now I Will continue that a secretary of state to be that voice for entrepreneurs in the state of Ohio State senator frankly rose thanks for coming in they can buy\nLet's take a quick break and then when we come back we'll hear from the Democrat in the race state representative Kathleen Clyde stay with us this was the sound of ideas I'm Mike McIntyre [noise]\n\nHas thoughts on today's show send an email to essay why at W.

Cleveland dot com\nSecond tier good to have you with us today we're talking with the three candidates for secretary of state in Ohio we've already heard from Republican frankly rose a bit we're going to hear from libertarian dust and then I Know the Democrats state representative Kathleen Clyde she begins by telling us why she's the best choice for office\nThis is a critical time in our state uh we have\nA culture of corruption that's really taken hold in Columbus after\nReally close to Thirty years of one party rule uh and it's time for a change it's time for a change in leadership and I am\nQualified for this office it's like I've been training for this my entire life and a lot of ways with the work I've done as an election official and as a lawyer focusing on election issues\nAnd I want to do some simple things make sure our elections and Ohio are fair secure and accessible\nI Want to make sure that it's easy to start and grow a business in our state and as a member of that redistricting commission I Want to make sure that we as fair districts that Ohioans deserve\nA to finally have their voices represented in Columbus and in Washington in this job plays an important role in that process\nLet's get into some of the issues one by one let's start with voting in your view is voting too hard\nI think that we have a lot of work\nThat we can do to make that process easier uh\nYou know I've been in the legislature now for four terms and there have been\nThirty Eight Belles energies to restrict voting in some way and my time in the legislature Thirteen of those bills were signed into law my opponent voting on the side for all of those and they've had it\nOh it's or increase the amount of purging that Ohio is doing when we're already out that the top in the country and the amount of voters that are being perched\nDoes that mean which is typically would you do\nWell right now we have a problem in our elections in Ohio with secret money infecting our political system and this has happened in a racist between candidates\nA dark money coming in and we don't know it's source and it's also happened in our issue campaigns that as as gone on in Ohio and would I Would like to do is\nI shine a light close those loopholes make sure we know who is spending in our elections in Ohio you no longer I Would be able to create a shadow organization to shield donors off from the public in our state\nThat currently is the process a and the foreign money issue is one that comes into play here too because when we don't know the donors we don't know if a foreign money is influencing our elections in the state\nSo we close that loophole or make any entity that is doing political spending disclose their donors\nAre and again strengthen that ban on on foreign money in our system and it's of critical importance that we have this disclosure we have transparency and we know what we're seeing who is spending and who's trying to influence our votes\nWould you have the power to do that a sector estate or or some of the things you're talking about things would involve national law and ruins by the Supreme Court et cetera in regards to ah who can give money and who's disclose how would you accept her state to close loopholes\nSo there is the federal election process which is not something that that I Would be able to influence the secretary of state but when it comes to our state elections or there's a lot of authority and the secretary of state to oversee our state's campaign finance\nIt's being disclosed and that Ohioans can be confident and the integrity of their elections in in a transparent system especially when it comes to those campaign finance contributions\nWe've talked a lot about elections because really that's what secretary of state's office was all about but there's more than that\nTo the sectors days off as one of them has to do with business filings et cetera it sounds like a a less exciting and a little more sleepy part of the job but both you and your opponent of said you want to use the abilities of the structure of state's office to make business go in Ohio especially small business how\nCan an agency that essentially the filing agency be a a sort of a promoter of business\nWell I'm excited about the opportunity to run that business services section you know the secretary of state's office his first stop for any new business filing in the state so I Want to make sure we're doing everything we can to be a welcome front door\nAnd to make it easy to start and grow a business in Ohio we've introduced a plan I talking about just how will do that and it includes provisions that would\nAh extend office hours so that working people who may be starting a business on the side and interface with the office after hours when to important that they be able to get their questions answered and get off to the to the right start\nAh we also are looking at ways to modernize the website and streamline things so that\nUh it's not confusing ah for Ohioans of which type of entity they want to create and they don't start down the wrong path from the get go\nWe also want to make it free for veterans to start a business in our state I think that's the least that we can do for Ohioans who have served and protected us too\nThat are made at the secretary of state's office ah we have a plan to do that based on what are some of the best ideas from other states and I look forward to hopefully having that opportunity again just to make it easy to start and grow a business in Ohio\nKathleen Clark thanks so much for coming up thanks so much for having me good to see a\nAfter the break libertarian candidate Dustin ... makes his case this is the sound of ideas on Mike

A. hyphen Cleveland dot org\nTalking to candidates for Ohio secretary of state already in the program we've heard from Republican frankly Rosen Democrat Kathleen Clyde now here's libertarian Dusten nana and he begins by answering our basic question why are you the best choice for the position\nWell quite frankly I don't think the secretary of state who is the chief elections officials should be a Republican or a Democrat and there are two beholden to their party um you know we see often too many times when that person is wearing the Jersey of the Republican or Democrat team that they often side with that party instead of siding with a justice and equality and things like that\nSo just the idea that you're not ... you're not one or\nThe ... yes I'm not going to be beholden to any Republican or Democrat interests or even libertarian interests you know I'm running because I I Believe in free and fair elections and I think Ohio deserves that\nWhat specifically about your background prepares you then to help Ohio have free and fair elections and to be the secretary of state\nWhile we're going to I've been it's been since ... about two thousand Fifteen now that I've been heavily involved and petitioning I mean you name a petition for this petition for that um and just you know knowing or see essentially like the back of my hand I think is going to be nice for somebody who once again as the chief elections official\nUm you know ... and like I said you know obviously to bring transparency and an independent a line to the office\nWhen you say you were involved in addition to mean circulating them circulating\nThem gathering them validating them um you know going to the secretary of state's office meeting with his attorneys making sure that the Libertarian Party was ... or a ... a hands on AT T's crowding his eyes crossing a C yeah yeah yeah\nSo that's a you know so that our petition will be successful and you know and we turned in a hundred and two thousand frost signatures I'm to be on the ballot and that's why I'm sitting here today\nStuffed them as a libertarian Europe ... opponent of government overreach but isn't the ... the realm of voter integrity really a place only the government can step into a sure integrity so there's a role for government\nYeah absolutely and and I very much consider myself a ...\nYou know I I definitely think there's a place for government and making sure that our elections are transparency there\nDo you think voting is too difficult in Ohio\nWell I'm not sure that that's the right question to ask I think the question should always be is how can we make voting easier you know we're we're going to say whether or not it's hard now we should always be easier we're moving into the you know twenty first century now um you know and I think you know by the time I'm fifty sixty years old that ah we're probably gonna be voting on line somehow or remotely so we need to be prepared for that\nAppreciate that answer the question was do you think that voting is too hard now do your do you\nUm you know I don't think voting is too hard now no but like I said obviously you want to make it easier um as easy as possible\nWhat do you think the biggest barriers or if there are any two people boating and how would you sold them if it became sectors states well\nWe saw some some voter purging or attempted voter purging with the with the previous secretary of state um and uh you know I think that that's the wrong way to go about it on the part of my campaign one of my main issues is automatic voter registration so I Would like to see any time the state clicks enough information from you to register you to vote rather that'd be\nFilling out forms for a driver's license whatever it be that uh they automatically registered to vote so that it's not a separate process\nWhat about the perjury or the voter rolls you just brought that the Supreme Court upheld Ohio's voter purge law five to four do you think the court was right\nYou know I think I actually I don't think the court right now you know we shouldn't be purging people off the rolls like I said they're easier ways to keep the rolls up to date like automatic voter registration if you know maybe I don't change my registration but I Do something else that indicates that I no longer live where I used to live that would help us keep the roles clean and avoid purchase\nStopped about early voting would you expand early voting restricted more or is it just right now", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "18"}
