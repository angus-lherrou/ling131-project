democracy test\nThe first thing Donald Trump did following his inauguration was to send his press secretary out to why Sean Spicer is claim about the size of the crowd on the mall was not only falls it was obviously demonstrably false\nSince and the president and spokespersons it issued a blizzard of lies so stick and so fast that it's hard to keep up\nIn this final episode of our series truth and faith will ask about the meaning and the corrosive effect of all of those laws we'll explore the moral and ethical basis of our faith and democracy and try to summarize some of the lessons learned in these programs\nBut let's start with democracy and troops which happens to be the title of a forthcoming book by sofia Rosenfeld she's a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania her other books include commonsense a political history and she joins us from her home in Philadelphia\nWelcome to the democracy test thanks so much for having me on so you argue that the moment I just mention the lie about the size of the crowd on the mall and inauguration day but that marks the transition for Donald Trump from what you call commonsense populism does something much darker why don't you begin with\nAbout truth in a sort of ... and there's always been something I think of a tension between a kind of highbrow resulted rhetoric off and backed up by\nSophisticated statistics and claims rooted in science\nAnd a advanced learning of various kinds and more folksy style that sort of says I Know things when I see them live a kind of a kitchen table logic that says you know there is no global warming because I went outside today and it was warmer than it was this time last year and in some ways that's a very long tradition American\nPolitical life and at times I think Trump\nHits that court in an ordinary sort of way using plain language folksy analogies\nKind of appealing to an every man style but then there are other moments when\nThat isn't quite the idiom that he draws upon and I think that moment you mentioned about the question about the inaugural crowd is an odd one because to lie about something in which the evidence is so which is a bleak clearly in front of everybody is to suggest not ally as a cover up\nBut a lie is a kind of political strategy of sorts unto itself\nAnd what is that strategy and I think that strategy is to say in some ways the\nFacts don't matter that sure sometimes on line sometimes on telling the truth sometimes and making it up but I'm not going to follow conventional norms in my speech patterns and authority is essentially going to reside with me\nIt's not going to be a matter of all of us agreeing on some common premise\nSo in a sense he's trying to demolish established authority and replace authority with himself is that what you're saying I think that's a good part of it I mean one of the interesting things about American political life and democracies in general is it there is no one source\nIt's not a sort of there is one Korea do and we must all described to it and yet when Trump says things\nThat might even strike he was off the wall in some cases are just mix it up he's insisting in a way that he has control over what counts as truth knowledge legitimacy\nThe president also expresses scorn for expertise you referred to that before you isn't that a part of what you're talking about\nYes I mean I think there are really two aspects to the lie and one is a kind of moral\nUh he sometimes says I've been hearing you know but without saying from home or with what evidence so it seems to me a whole bunch of rhetorical strategy that all work in the same way which is to say I don't have facts and figures I don't need facts and figures and if I had them they'd\nBe distorted any way you can't really trust in the FBI the center for Disease Control New York times whatever it is I go by instinct to and I go by what I'm just hearing on the street so to speak but the danger there is that nobody knows anything about anything then\nOther politicians can't help but notice it you appear to be able to campaign fact free and still be elected president these days do you think that's going to be part of the Trump legacy\nYeah that's that's a of course the great worry because Trump didn't create the phenomenon of Trump it onto self he didn't you know drop out of the sky and you won't be around forever either the question is will this style of politics remain and if it does\nWhat does it mean for democracy and going forward I think she at the moment\nAll over the world we're seeing that this is a pretty effective technique that in the age of um [noise] the Internet particularly it's very easy to spread untruth in such a way that it's not even clear what the truth and what's an untruth any more\nPopulist style at least has\nOver in many corners of the world with quite different political traditions so whether this is going to turn out to be a sort of blip in American\nOr whether this is going to be a sort of turning away from this moment of enlightenment inspired ideas the truth I think is very hard to say it and I don't think we're at a point yet in which we can really predict\nWhich way the winds are going to blow not only us but in England for instance as well Great Britain there's enormous political division I mean it's just about half the population is\nMoving one direction while the other half is moving the other way so that kind of polarization either suggests we're heading to some sort of real social breakdown or that one side is ultimately going to prevail and what can be pretty brutal struggle\nYou know it's interesting we speak of transformational presidents like a regular Dona Roosevelt or or Ronald Reagan moved to ... to put during the Trump maybe in the category\nThat may be the case I mean he does seem in some way to be breaking from a tradition or their one can look at policies and say well there are certain amount of continuity with say that George W. Bush years and ah in some areas and the others not and certainly um\nThe Republican Party hasn't\nBeen transformed overnight but yet there is something different\nAnd I think it explains some of the kind of hysteria in opposition and I think it explains the very fact that every newspaper in the country is now sort of putting on the front page of chronicle of lives of the President's Day after day something that's really hard to imagine in a previous moment in quite the same form\nSomething has really shifted beneath us and yeah that might make that might make Trump despite himself in some ways a transformational president\nIs he not simply appealing to the anti intellectual strain that has a long history in this country near that whole idea of why should you listen to experts why should you listen to egg heads just use your common sense that seems to be something that's been a strain in GOP history since at least try Reagan\nPublic life in the U.S most evident but it's true elsewhere to has been a kind of conflict from the beginning between a growing\nA emphasis on expertise and ah facts and figures and knowledge derived from elite to various kinds particularly educational each but that's often means also economic elites on the one hand and this kind of populist\nTradition sometimes just as a rhetorical covers sometimes more profoundly put a story about the people being dispossessed of their basic no how\nAn instinctive sense of how things should be and how they are\nAnd Trump vacillates a little between those two registers but I think that the pushback that we might call populist is shorthand comes also from a recent triumph of a more technocratic vision of troops so when\nEuropeans protest against the European Union or Americans complain about politics inside the beltway they're complaining about some of the same things which is a kind of politics that seems cut off from real people that doesn't\nAsk people what their concerns are doesn't care about their values and populism says you know ... swallow it all out throw out all that\nI'm a few skating euphemistic language all that\nA highbrow highfalutin ... studies and get let's get back to what we know just by going about a business you know just the the knowledge that comes from experience living in the world there's something of course really\nHypocritical perhaps you might say about a man like Trump but and you know the number of political leaders have used that language a court tend themselves to be wealthy educated living right inside that bubble up ... trying to pretend they're sort of regular folks\nSort of richer larger than life but still has the ability he ordered to pay for a way yes [noise] I often get\nRicher and\nThanks very much [noise]\nSevere Rosenfeld new book is democracy and truth a short history she's the Walter each Annenberg professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania [noise]\nYou could learn more about this program at our website which is truth politics and power dot O.

I Believe that all politics ... local politics I\nAnd I think that there is actually some truth to it which is why you see I think in our current moment that if you go from district district as the news has been reporting\nWhat you find is that a good number of folks animated by by issues on on the ground and they seem to be driven to respond to those issues are on the ground this was not to say\nAnd I'll I'll stop my point here but this is not to say that there still isn't a sort of deficit and a serious one\nOr in terms of being properly informed there's no way to get on about the business of engaging seriously with Trump Administration and his base and not think that one is dealing with both of the ministry ... and the citizenry our constituency that isn't properly informed\nAnd so ah how do we deal with that well the way we deal with that is too I'm In good hard does fashion to vote folks out um and devote other folks in\nThe ... come full circle to your idea of civic virtue NF personal virtue that even if you're not following the news and following every twist and turn of what's happening with the administration you need to make choices about who you are and who our society is and make those choices at that\nLevel of your school and you're churches and your civic organizations even if you are not glued to the news every day\nSo two points here the first is yes I think that's absolutely right and the second point which I think is related to the the comment that I made earlier um [noise] it has to be the case and I have to put it in this in this form has to be the case that one is still open to and willing to you\nOpinions that seemed to to bump up against the views that you have\nAnd the moment in which one is no longer interested in looking at\nData opinion attend interviews that stand in tension with one's own then we'll we'll be in big trouble\nAnd I think that this is one of the law hallmarks right of the of the Trump Administration and in many ways his base and part of what is so damaging about this if in fact it becomes the hallmark of the scenario as such\nAs that the very capacity we need\nIn order to be responsive to the grievances the problems we find ourselves confronting the very capacity that we depend on that doesn't say the openness the ability to listen to the other side the moment in which that that goes away\nThen democracy is a already dead in these dark times what are you worried about the most\nWhat I worry about the most is that um do we may have been wrong and by implication I'm wrong but I don't worry about that in some kind of um of of sort of self preferential private land the sense that I Would I Would rather be right all the time and we we all get things wrong\nI worry about this because work to be the case um do we got this wrong then it was largely me that the ideal of democracy or places to great demand on us to honor it\nAnd it may be that democracy places to great of a demand on us not merely because of\nThe ideal that it represents but perhaps because it is far too noble um for us to attain and and that's that's what I\nBut it's not just John do as a whole tradition\nAnd that is the sense in which\nWe as ordinary everyday individuals and that set of style that we are not a fixed creatures with a capacity for transformation and for development is central\nTo who we are as human beings and then in the context of the United states we have actually made that elasticity of plasticity the hallmark the foundation of a democratic society\nAnd if that's the case then it means that who we seemed to be and I'll courage treat that allow fellows at our current practices of cruelty need not determine who we will look up\nThank you very much like you know in Rogers is an associate professor of political science at Brown his forthcoming book is that dark in light of the race democracy and freedom in African American political

violence am I wrong to think this is as dark a moment as there's been in living memory\nYou know I'm Sorry to say I don't think you're wrong I think this is as bad as time has we've had really since the Eighteenth fifties although certainly we have had violent other years in our history\nAnd violent times in our history but what has really always defined us until this moment is that the people who were struggling believed in American democracy and they believed that the problems that they were seeing where the American democracy was not doing what they wanted it to do\nNow it seems we have a number of people who actually don't believe in American democracy and would like to replace it with something else and how that's going to play out I think is anybody's guess at this moment\nI wanted to ask you a question ... another question about history I've read comparisons of Trump ism to the no nothing's a movement that briefly flourished in the middle of the nineteenth century that is right up your alley it seems to me is the comparison fair\nThere are elements of no nothing has them in the Trump coalition for sure the no nothing's wanted to keep America as a country for white people and they hated immigrants but it's really important to remember that the no nothing's really never got national power they were powerful only in Massachusetts and they were powerful only for a very brief time\nThey were sort of a ... when it became clear that the major parties were not answering the needs of regular people and they all collapsed\nSomething had to replace them and there were a whole bunch of little parties and that was one of them the no nothing's got absorbed by the Republican Party very shortly after they started and was in a number of years the Republican Party including the no nothing's was in favor of immigration not against it so\nYeah there were at the same starting places for the known if nothing party and the Trump coalition", "year": "2018",
