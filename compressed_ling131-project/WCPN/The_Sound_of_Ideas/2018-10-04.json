students have gotten all of their shocked\nIf parents want to opt out they have to get an exemption but how did we get there how to schools become enforcers effect scene policies reporter Avi Wilson errant is here now and he's looked into that long history\nHey obviously Mike him so where does this story begins when do schools get interested in vaccines but when you look\nInto the history it turns out that the relationship between vaccines in schools is about as old as kids having to go to school in the middle of the nineteenth century more states are passing laws that require kids to go to school rather than you know working through their child\nSo this is also the industrial age cities are growing I'm guessing schools are growing up and then you have a whole bunch of kids in classrooms together exactly right\nAnd and I talked about this with gyms co broke he's a historian at Columbia University\nKids are always more vulnerable to infectious diseases and when you start to put more and more kids together in the same place\nIt's a natural a response to say well we're going to require these kids to be vaccinated and we're doing this because we don't want to see outbreaks of contagious diseases are in our schools\nSo an Eighteen fifty five Massachusetts became the first state to say you know my kids can't come to school unless they get the smallpox vaccine which is the only vaccine available back then did other states do the same thing follow suit not really here's James again\nIt took a long time for states to get really serious about school vaccination laws then they got really serious now we're in a moment again we're public health experts are wondering how far they can go before hurting their own calls for the pulse ...\nThis is the polls I'd ... we're talking about in schools and held\nA lot of parents and teachers are concerned about stress levels among students and how the pressure to succeed and get good grades is impacting kids mental health on this issue is heating up in Hong Kong which on the surface seems to have one of the world's best education systems students they are\nConsistently end up in the top rankings of international test\nBut there's a darker side to academic achievement and a culture of test taking one that parents are pushing back against\nI talked about this with old alone cousin he is a public health consultant who lived in Hong Kong for nine years his daughter was born there and he started worrying about the pressure she faced in school early on\nLots of writing lots of worksheets even in kindergarten and as the years progressed they grew exponentially and it's really quite overwhelming for for a young child\nFamily moved to England a year ago in part to get away from this high pressure school system alone says when they were in Hong Kong every night\nBut beyond that what's happening in his home there were a big problem\nI think most parents keep it in the family but most parents are actually quite concerned that the kids are under too much pressure\nNot sleeping enough and often times we had when we were there a spike in suicides among students students as young as nine years old and\nI think a lot of parents were really worried when they saw that although they again felt like they couldn't opposed the system and then there were\nQuite a number of parents sort of a smaller group who were willing to speak out and organize protests and organize\nOpen letters that we sent to the education bureau insisting that they do more to reduce the pressure there's the pressure is actually coming from the whole education system and the tests that kids have to take to go from primary school to secondary school to university\nAnd you and the other parents thought that this intense pressure pushed children into a very dark place and there was a fallout from that\nThey'll definitely and there's there were a number of studies done surveys done uh about the mental health among students young and old hand most of them showed a clear correlation between academic pressure and self harm depression we we did have a number of\nMeetings with officials in the education bureau but they really reluctant and they would always they would always push back in the debate and say you can't prove that that's what caused the students suicide or you can prove that that's what's what's caused so much depression among young kids and it's true it's it's very hard to prove\nA but you can show statistical correlation and and obviously they don't want to admit because then they'll have to change their whole system\nWhat is the steak whether they are real\nHappens with the stakes are very very real for Hong Kong kids if you don't do well on a test you will often not get into the better school\nThere's a lot of pressure from parents to do well on your tests or you can get into the good high school or secondary school and then there's a single test to see the number that you get on this task determines if you go to university or not for high school students\nWhat happens to kids who just are not good at taking tests\nYeah uh the kids who can't do well on tests simply do move forward in the system is very little flexibility\nYou're in England now what are the difference is you're seeing in terms of their schooling and what's what's asked of kids\nThe difference is quite stark actually when we got here and my daughter was just shocked because it was basically no homework she went from getting a couple of hours a night to getting maybe half an hour a week or one hour a week\nAnd the efforts in in Hong Kong are the ongoing or the other parents still added tried to change the system\nAbsolutely I'm Still still on the what's that groups\nThe push continues to hopefully hopefully sooner or later people will will realize that there are a lot of negative side effects in addition to the the high test scores that that kids encounter do as a result of this system\nAlone cousin is a public health consultant and he lives in England now\n[noise] I'm Out headlights can become a never ending problem [noise]\nThat was non stop by but just treat it to go to

from the classroom reporter and dad and ... looked into changing attitudes and school policies around the issue [noise]\nTo me go our psyche may never really know where exactly it happened maybe here on this playground in Berkeley, California it may have been at school but somewhere along the way her two children caught him foot in mouth disease three times\nMy oldest son actually had twice so I was pretty familiar with how he'd symptoms got developed a fever that Bush is that kinda thing\nHand foot in mouth disease is a nasty sounding virus but it's actually pretty common especially among young children over the past five years ... so much work to take care of her children when they were out sick she's had to quit her job as a social worker and find more flexible part time employment\nThis past spring she got a call from the pre school again\nHer two year old was one of several new cases of hand foot in mouth disease and the class she picked him up back at home she didn't see any symptoms for the next day her husband brought their son back to school\nAnd teach asked him why he's at\nThe school can we go in her husband were following school policy their son was symptom free for twenty four hours and its fever was under a hundred degrees but despite the official protocol the teachers were nervous\nHe was asked if we took him to the doctor and got the clearance about uh he doesn't have the disease and then another teacher another day ask him that same question\nWe go says they felt pressure to take their son out of school but according to a pediatrician dean Blumberg keeping a kid home for a few days for hand foot in mouth disease doesn't help much to prevent it spread even after they recover\nPastor intestinal tract that's what may be transmitted by a symptomatic children also\nAt the military debuted sex ed during World War one as a way to educate soldiers about syphilis in ... I'm not long after it started popping up in school curriculums for the most part it was about the basic biology of sex preventing STDs and unwanted pregnancies\nBut over time ideas about what should be included or not included have changed\nI like stern graduated from high school and twenty eleven she identifies as bisexual and when she looks back on her sex ed classes she has mixed feelings\nFrom what I remember sex at at my school got off to a rough start the first lesson came in eighth grade it was a one hour class that we hadn't set of Jim one time I asked my friend to operate Brian how she remembered it she was a year behind me in school but we have the same class both of us came out much later in college\nI don't remember any conversations about condoms and you know or I think like late last like banana condo moment never happened I Know that they talk to the boys about condoms because I remember\nI remember I remember hearing later that um that the male gym teacher was like oh yeah like wear a condom and then they all kind of laughed about it and then they played basketball for the rest of the\nMy God that is absolutely what happened [laughter] yeah so in the girl's room or we talked about like how not to get rapes I guess or I mean I feel like I could like list the scenarios that she told us that you could get raped [laughter] she also had\nThe conversations about like how to wear your hair because yeah because you'd grab your ponytail God yeah but I don't think it's not that I don't think that those are things that people shouldn't here I'm a but also like\nI don't know that's not I don't I think that's probably not what I Want from sex ed immediately\nAn aids or teacher told us gay men were more likely to contract it because their sex included quote ripping and tearing\nAdrian I agreed we would have liked that conversation to go differently [noise]\nBecause it made being gay seem dangerous and even violent but also because we could probably have used some real information unsafe sex and different types of relationships studies find that young where women have higher rates of STDs\nSex ed in high school with a lot more serious hole marking period class everyday Aubrey remembers the anatomy drawings she was supposed to fill out\nIt was one of those crappy when drugs were for like the ... and with China and you know so it was just like three dots\nI remember there being a breakdown of different forms of contraception I Know we watched a video of a woman giving birth and that I very convenient we had to go to the bathroom during the actual birth scene neither Aubrey nor I remember any discussion about algae ... year\nI I Do really wish there was some acknowledgement of\nQueer sucks in a healthy way somebody college one of those identities um because I wasn't out at all like even a really aware of\nThat identity for myself\nBut when we were in high school marriage equality hadn't passed yet ... people were beginning to be more accepted but not in the same way that we are now the me too movement hadn't happened and conversations about sexual assault and harassment sounded a lot different\nSo I was curious if things have changed since then\nI took a train back to my old high school in New Jersey to find [noise]\nMy health teacher Mr damned or tone still teach sex at there I met up with him in the front of the building [noise]\nHey good how are you this\nIs your door tone told me that some new topics have been added to the cell death and that others have been changed for example the district has a pretty low pregnancy rate so they've dropped some of the material about the cost\nLook it up and fly guys you can see whatever you want to watch it's a little less science heavy now we minimize the biology stuff we've added more to\nThe sense of consent and\nRelationships healthy relationships dating violence he says\nThe shift in culture has definitely impacted the class including the way they talk about consent\nThe me too movement has\nReally put into overdrive\nWe spent probably a good\nFour or five classes discussing\nHow to obtain consent what verbal consent\nMr ... says that ... identities were on the ... the year I took sex at but they've expanded on it for example five years ago he started bringing in a speaker whose trans but he says the biggest difference now is actually what the students walk into the room already knowing\nTheir exposure is higher so their understanding I feel like is getting deeper and with less pushback\nThat means the conversations he has with them can be more complex\nI was curious if this evolution was typical across the country so I got in touch with ALS or knock yeah he has a book called for goodness sex changing the way we talk to a teams about sexuality values in health he's also been affects educator for over Thirty years first I told them about my memories of sex ed so it sounds very standard for\nFive to ten years ago um and it I think in many places it is still pretty standard today I think a lot of sexuality education in the U.S is still fear based and heavy on biology and about avoiding negative consequences\nOut those are good sex ed curriculum should be based on the idea that sex as normal natural and a positive part of being human it should include consent and\nCertainly have to talk about talk inclusive Lee about gender and sexual orientation and ability um\nAnd make decisions about it [noise] so ... you know we do need to talk about the basic such stuff\nStuff like pregnancy avoiding pregnancy and STDs Allen my old health teacher Mr door tone both cover all that in their classes but it's still pretty rare sex ed isn't even mandatory and more than half the country I'm a little jealous of the kids at my high school now\nThey get a chance to learn about sex and a different way a chance to really examine all the assumptions we bring into the bedroom about consent and gender roles and identity and analyze them I think as a ... person and as a woman those kinds of conversations would have been valuable for me as an adult [noise]\nFor the call I'm Alex during [noise]\nSo sex ed is only mandated in half of all states and what is Todd varies wildly across the country in California and new law mandates that sex ed B. L. gp teach you inclusive but as those new requirements are rolling out across the state\nThere's been some fierce opposition not just against the new requirements but against sex ed in general\nAnd the pushback is coming from a place you might not expected the liberal bay area particularly some Silicon Valley suburbs reporter at San jerks has been covering this and she joins us now to talk more\nAnd ... you have been looking at this controversy in free ... ... what happened the Arab why we're so many parents coming out to to talk about this issue and to be at school board meetings\nHundreds of parents who'd be showing up these up at these meetings that would last until the early morning well I think one thing that you have to\nAnd South Asian and its schools the students are Seventy percent Asian many of the parents grew up in different cultures and those were you know many of the parents who came up and and were opposed so there was a real real culture clash here's one of the parents her name is Sylvia long\nThey even talked about um lovemaking positions they talk about sexual intercourse these things I'm even ashamed to talk about it I'm forty five year oh I don't want my ten year old girls to to be involved in that\nSo if parents don't want their kids to hear that kind of information could they opt out of sex ed rather than battling against the course\nYes they can totally opt out that's always been a kind of part of the system but you know parent after parents said that wouldn't work the parent you just heard from Sylvia wall and uh she thought that even the current curriculum as it stands was too much she opted her daughter out but you know kids do talk\nShe told me one day that mom I Know all these things already because kids who attended the class of talk about things like that is so gross you know that just took away my innocence when I heard that and I was really angry\nI Will say that on the other side of parents who were really pro the sex education said look kids do talk and that's why we need to have this [noise] so what\nDoes a conversation about the new lesson plans specifically where there are aspects of parents were opposing or was this really a conversation about sex ed all around\nYou know I think it was all of those things I mean some objected to what they said were was explicit material they said that you know a lot of this material was too explicit for kids that were too young to handle it and understand it\nGenerous support for coverage of community issues programming ... point three WCBS and

[noise]\nYou're back with us out of ideas from Ninety point three on Mike McIntyre little after nine twenty six AM\nIn Nineteen Eighteen American troops were being sent overseas to fight and die in the trenches of Europe in World War one by wars and more than a hundred and Fifteen thousand Americans would be dead more than fifty three thousand of those deaths in combat the rest of disease\nNot everyone supported the move to enter the so called great war opponents included labor leader and socialist party presidential candidate Eugene Debs who delivered a powerful rebuke to the war effort at a speech in Canton a century ago here the short portion of extra to that speech is read by actor mark Russell low in two thousand seven\nThe class\nWho fight all the bad or a working class who makes the Supreme sacrifices the working class so freely shed the blood and furnished their corpses had\nNever had a voice in either the glaring war or making the [noise]\nIt is a ruling class that invariably does\nThey declare war and they all own make\nPeace Debs was arrested under the Espionage Act in Nineteen Seventeen amended with the sedition acts in Nineteen Eighteen because he spoke out against the war he was tried in federal court in Cleveland and convicted of obstructing military recruitment enlistment do you have been careful not to use words that specifically called for such action\nA judge sentenced up to ten years Debs to ten years in prison from his cell he received nearly a million\nTwenty six scholars and academics will be commemorating Debs of speech and trial tomorrow and Saturday at centennial events and they'll discuss the state of free speech a century later and joining me now to discuss the event UT Eugene Debs of speech and why a century later academics still say it resonates\nWe have in Studio Dr David Goldberg he's professor emeritus of history at Cleveland State University Good to have you with us Dr\nAnd Kevin O'Neill is with us as well associate professor at the Cleveland Marshall College of law Kevin good as he is good to see you and thank you for having me if you would like to join our conversation let's talk about this historical that maybe it's something you do remember from civics class\nOr maybe not if you'd like to talk about this speech of Eugene Debs the fact that he was arrested in the United states we always thought about the first amendment protection of free speech but\nWhere was it in Nineteen Eighteen you can call us at eight six six five seven eight zero nine zero three Sunday mailed to ask her why a WPN dot org or tweet at us at sound of ideas a Kevin did ... get a raw deal absolutely and\nIn terms of the way the U.S Supreme Court interpret the first amendment now he never could have been convicted\nA now the Supreme Court agrees and this is both the left wing and the right wing of the court that the one power that is denied the government under the first amendment is the power to single out viewpoints that cannot be expressed\nOr the government does not have the power to pick and choose which viewpoints can and which viewpoints cannot be expressed\nDavid when we think about this moment in history a hundred years ago this wasn't just a a an overzealous prosecutor the sentiment was against this kind of speech to the press the public\nAnd in this case the prosecutor and judge we're we're all in league with the idea that you shouldn't be able to speak in this way\nAll of this was a result of the Wilson Administration when I brought the United states into the war and\nProject at tended to repress speech against the war that all was then amended by this edition act strengthened by this edition act so is it there were deliberate effort by the ... the limit the ability to speak out during the conflict\nHimself gets up and gives a two hour diatribe really um\nI guess he got it off his chest [laughter] it didn't quite help him in terms of the the trial it didn't seem as though he was he was trying to win a case and that in fact decided inside as much yeah he did he didn't seem ... he did not he\nDid not have any impact upon the trunk or a judge that's for sure but you know ... was after ... this was his sweet spot the ability to speak or I'm passionately and persuasively and so he probably had greater oratorical skills and his lawyers do it anyway\nAnd and did he did he say anything in the courtroom and you thought might have led to a new charges I mean we look at that speech as well\nUm so so yeah it was this two hour speech that he gave 'em and the Espionage Act continue to be used after that although you mentioned the stream court sort of changed the way it applied a standard to it does the Espionage Act continue today this edition act as well and you know we ever see it being employed\nThe Espionage Act is still on the books um but again because we have had the developments in the Supreme Court where we interpret the the words of a speaker and now we we look we look as judge hands suggested we look specifically at what the speaker says and whether he is exerting\nHis audience to break the law right now or in the imminent future that's the that's the standard that replaced clear and present danger or in Nineteen sixty nine\nOr and so that's why we can still have the Espionage Act on the books\nAnd it doesn't have the same a terrible effect on free speech that it did a when Dems was alive the sedition acts was repealed in Nineteen Twenty one\nAnd the ... act any suspicion act that would criminalize just sent or criticizing the government would never survive in court or it would be struck down um it would be ...\nIn this Eugene v ... centennial event that begins tomorrow and also with us has been David Goldberg he is a professor of history at Cleveland State university and how about will have a final thought for you from your professor and\nWhat I Want to add the point that there was one he spoke in the federal courtroom and what is arguably the most important political trial ever to occur in the United states not in Cleveland refused to make the technical defense which\nHe wanted to stand on his principles\nSo he gave probably what might be considered his most eloquent address ever put two hours in a packed federal courtroom where he stood on his principles and refused to concede to again any pleased by people to avoid prison\nBecause he thought the war was so wrong and he thought the right of free speech was so important\nIt turns out he does go to prison he by the way gets almost a million votes for president in the next year's election correct the one who won that election Warren Harding eventually does commute his sons doesn't pardon him but commutes it\nSo you're done and and he's out dies just five years later what we did this have an impact do you think on the on the the whole the rest of his life from from Nineteen Eighteen to his death and twenty six\nYears president had a terrible impact on the abs he was ill in the years before I went to prison I'm healthcare in prison of course is very poor I might add though on the other hand that's just kind of I think we figure\nWhen he went to prison he became extremely popular with the other prisoners\nWho he often felt themselves have been victims one way or another the system and even with the war did he was a figure who was a magnetic figure who attracted support wherever he went but the prison did terrible damage to the average person would\nYou want to learn more about that than uh\nAnd earlier if you'd like to get some

Brown's almost wanna gamely\nYeah all my [laughter] a boy that's what a title do for [laughter] um yeah so I think it means something I I think\nMore importantly I'm is whether they have their people healthy for the for the post season and at this time last year we all were wondering why Cory Cooper wasn't starting game on 'em and we found out is that series progressed and and we know now that Michael Brennan we use a different guy and he was last year\nWe were had a back problem yeah so I I I think those are two\nReally significant things I I heard Jason kittens say thinks this rosters best when they've had in the last three years and when you look at a younger Alonzo in Donaldson and the people they've added a I think that he might be right\nSo Kevin collapsed eleven game winning streak in the world series victory\n[laughter] if they can get past the first round who knows I mean this this is the toughest match up they probably could have got out of the gate I mean the the Red Sox won ... games but their pitching staff shaky the Yankees pitching staff is shaky this is the American ... loaded and the Astros are defending champs who\nHad the best run differential in baseball and they have the best starting staff other than maybe the Indians so this if they can get by this first round then I mean they might be the favorites wrestle a it but this first round that's a brutal\nMatch we haven't had a meaningful game all year really the Indians want it going away because of division is so horrible does that and then they have an inter squad game the other day to get sharp and that's that's even less meaningful so does that you know make them susceptible old B flat footed and punched in the face I don't\nSo I think that that's part of the reason though that the only one was in Ninety One game just because they didn't really have a ton to play for they knew that they are going to win the division I I think the division race it pretty much over in may and they didn't have they didn't have a ton to play for other than postseason positioning and you kind of saw that with some of their ups and downs this year but I mean they know what's at stake here they know", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "04"}
