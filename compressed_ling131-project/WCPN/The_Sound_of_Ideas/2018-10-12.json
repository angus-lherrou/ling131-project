it down to [noise] I'm fascinated by coincidences and could listen for hours to stories about them but what is it that so fascinates us about these\nThe author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how he thinks about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to your first [noise]\nAt least book exam and how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise]\nThis is a remarkably useful skill [noise] let me sometimes miss apply it\nWe sometimes attribute intention entity to things that aren't even living [noise] especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day let me give hurricanes a name Katrina Sandy Andrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina\nThe mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America [noise]\nThis is a new\nFor centuries people have described intention ... to natural force is we think storms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind of their own\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or [noise] or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people is a good way to learn about each other as a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with any kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something\nThat doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have in mind behind\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given\nDescribed it or reported that have had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance uh billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls often the predicted direction where you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on a table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain and in these cases\nSometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute them on to something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain\nWhat's going on in this uh autonomous in this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an age of behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set up\nThis underwater Roomba for the lack of a better term to clean the bottom of the pools that sort of rolls around the bottom of the pool and it goes into completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and\nI find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more a lot even away then something that moves into very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly ... start to get a little sense of a mind that people are crazy you don't\nYou don't think it's like your mother writer or your your ... your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but\nAs you can buy outfits to dress it up or if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of people thinking of their room bus having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does I Want to talk\nTo a little bit about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stop and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happened it was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of many different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise]\nThis is what underwater room buzz have to do with coincidences like a robot that does something unexpected coincidence this crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we stopped to seek patterns even when they aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in a world of psychology is actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor Tom Gilovich\nHaving a brilliant psychologist in traverse who's the illusion of the hot hand in fast [noise]\nThe myth is that basketball players get on a roll people believe the basketball players get hot hair and that there are times when they're on and the chance of making a bath [noise] it's higher after they've just made one\nWrong conclusions about district with imagined that there are good shooter and they shoot fifty percent from the bat fifty percent probability is going to produce a lot more Clampitt [noise]\nPeople name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document and it was a review on this paper and they're now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brecht looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forty cents is joy examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working is Baker's butchers working as butchers\nMiners working as minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every surname there is a currently the top two thousand surname that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to see of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families who are in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices\nPossibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations there's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did in a fifty percent chance as he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one\n... county farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent Palin has looked at large data sets in public records like the Social Security deaths index or state marriage\nRecords databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds\nOf funny affects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as uncommon as you might think beyond what you might expect by chance\nAnd there's about a seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them tested eco terrorism as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shape what everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these small effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nRead says that if you really love your butt day the effect gets even larger or operational\nDefinition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday them\nAgain Brett cost is an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or you'll but he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with them\nSo you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that and the the best bit of evidence I have but I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names I don't like that\nAnd my additional kind of know if he might be a serial killer someday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same day if you were born on April twentieth\nYou might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to read finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable that I myself\nHad fallen prey to ... you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankar out my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as ... and I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that it'd be very interesting\nAnd the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you said this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit eager\nTo read his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in your jak decision\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself in a city ... affecting\nWe're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic examples that my son Matthew\nI'm his his last name as Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lessons Pelham and I entered a relationship with her before I developed this did not after I developed the theory to validate the so so your column and you got it\nHow are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have\nTo think it did I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um different religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAnd the worst yes she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nI said I and I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while\nThere is a certain smiled at comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see\nYou you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense that my choices that deliberate choices that I've thought about that my ...\nI make name intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they have these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself it is a disturbing idea\nIt is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I do what you said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias or implicit he gets his them so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings\nBut I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough for the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea\nBut I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why do what I Do I mean there's just too much research and much of what you've documented in reporting on that show that buys these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it the Serbian as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n\nAnd by Mary those born on the twenty third of July [noise]\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitates to what's carpentry why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own\nThat at least races tough questions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHave at least a little note edging influence\nUm based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number\nThat's not an objectively great reason to get married you should get married because you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabid Marxist but learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do\nA apparently to some people's ... I find it delightful but some people find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there is no such things free well but it to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make a decision\nFor one reason that we told ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put our fingers on\nAnd this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your butt in general we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us and that can be a big problem\nAbsolutely I Do a little bit of research on social justice and that's one of the things that concerns me most is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us who speak our language who speak our idiom who look like us who worship like us and we have much less attention to the problems of people who don't\nOn the other hand I think this this finding like any funding in psychology and behavioral economics can be used for good or evil and it the way it works in the world can be used for good or bad and so a great example that I perceive as at least a cousin of ... is a study I think was done by\nGenerous support for coverage of community issues programming ... point three WC piano Idea Stream comes from the George gun foundation advance in Cleveland and northeast Ohio\nDo not be satisfied that was mayor Frank Jackson message through Clevelanders are Newsweek long delayed state of the city address were twenty eight teams look at his recap and most state of challenges plus dissect the claims of just how much has been accomplished since voters approve the income tax on people working and living in this city welcome to the sound of ideas ...

talked about it on the show that those allegations are from Sharon brands are divorced back in the eighties\nHad come up and other campaigns so I'm not surprised at all what is interesting is that this time or his ex wife ... actually did an ad\nThat she did a a Youtube video that has been distributed out there saying\nHey ... was reiterating the claims that she's made before that divorces are top that that this is been resolved since then which is an interesting line I mean you know there's this idea of well what she lying then or is she line now well there's a possibility that it could be somewhere in the middle that\nThat what happened happened and it has been resolved and I think that's the line that she's trying to walk there but you know it it it really is interesting to see these claims come up when certainly there are claims that other people could bring up you know with regard to Republican candidates who are on the ballot right now\nAnd and also it it does to try to distract from some of the issues in the Senate campaign I mean you've got a lot of important federal issues that are ongoing in terms of health care and immigration and that sort of thing and and those are the issues that I think a lot of voters want to learn more about\nIs clearly a wedge issue but it's also something that if\nYou know if it's his can help him get nice a Republican base that we thought it would be the theory that's what we're seeing for Republicans around the country they've gone back and said hey we're going to run on his cabinet on on religion because our base love this and they're going to say that you know the whole mob\nMob rule I Do the truth from Mitch McConnell and other Republicans is with that is going to be seen but it's also going to pop up\nDuring the other forms of this on a league of women voters office of the global Cleveland mutual sauce but this was produced by the Ohio debates immersion nonpartisan group all media outlets academic institutions civic organizations why the new player in the game we should also for the schools are so they're just all four of our employers for part of this\nYeah in fact I was the moderator of the first to Ohio to make commission debate which was on Monday with the candidates for governor and and so I'm intimately familiar with the the uh organization and and what they're trying to do as I said to my lead in on Monday Night if you are watching or listening on public radio or television is on commercial television as well\nYou would've heard me say that uh the group was formed to create better debates for better elections\nAnd that's the whole idea is for media organizations to be more involved and for candidates to be held accountable to to make them debate so to speak because if you recall twenty four team we didn't have any debates at all and obviously twenty four team was a\nAn unusual year especially in the governor's race but it was also frustrating I think for a lot of people because they're still believes the debates are important\nI Know when you talk to strategist they'll say now what's important is TV ads and that's where people make their decisions\nBut I think that there is a real place for civil conversation about policy issues for real questions from journalists and from people who want to know the answers about a variety of issues and that's what we got what they had to make commission people submitted questions ... odd me and to other journalist Jere rubbish from WBFO ... here in Columbus and ...\nWe presented them the candidate and I think it was a real opportunity to hear face to face from Richard Cordray and Mike DeWine and and I think that's invaluable\nTwo things one chair and did a tremendous job to do that thing running to shut them down when they started the bloated too since we're talking about the commission\nOr got a got a tip to have to Joe Miller's I'm and she was the person who organized this thing hurt him to catch on our own phone calls every week it was a massive undertaking in without her work this would not have\nHave made it um the debate I think the governor's debate was fantastic I what struck me about that debate is we have to\nLong standing candidates people of integrity who paint completely different pictures of the future and I don't think we've had that in decades if you go back over the gubernatorial elections we have not had this kind of a choice in in forever I mean\nThese two guys would will take us in very different directions we have a choice this time what will Ohio big\nI'm kind of us have to understand the ... thing not to blow things up there because these guys who scores are saying they both realistically however shocked when this thing\nAbsolutely the races clothes and the other two\nMen who have thought about this for a long time they've been wanting to be governor for a long time\nAnd it's clear when you talk to them that they really have some issues that they are very passionate about they've they've done a lot of thinking about and they consulted with a lot of people about and I think that came through in the debate I mean there were some issues\nThat each candidate may have been a little weaker on maybe but I think overall they both have really considered this and and they ... they want to do this and I think the fact\nOf the race is close really does show that there is a choice\nOhio typically has big blowout ... races I mean you know in in many years there have been races that have been decided by ten points or more that's what we had a twenty fourteen which was the second largest\nHear from these candidates and not just having to go on what they say on a TV ad is really important\nTo interesting because these are unknown quantities unlike a worst thing Mr ... and introduced himself we know these guys pretty well they're not prone to controversy a dramatic displays of emotion which allows us has increased to focus more on what they're saying what they're doing and they covered a lot of ground to debate\nFormat I I was I was stunned at how much we got from them because of that format and because of how tight they were they were contained by Karen or to the to the time and\nI I mean I I don't think I've seen that quality of a debate ... this was not what you see across the country this isn't you know let's try that Kavanaugh these guys are talking specifics on every issue and they differ on a lot of things I mean look the other thing is is I think rich Cordray\nUp for his part has really tapped into the local government funded issue um I think he's gotten feedback as he's gone around local governments are hurting taxes have gone up and he's really pushed like the wind on that that you know I think about that\nWhen do you really make local government funds in his shoe in a campaign this is this is me\nThis is substance when your party spent eight years taking hundreds of millions of dollars of a vital part of the points of French accident a city's lost a hundred and forty million dollars since the advocate could have been at the same as unfair and there were some shots blended there was some funds is broke\nI mean we when Jacki and Jerry and I came up with our questions with the help of the questions submitted by the Ohio and make commission from people and who wanted to ask\nQuestions about certain things and then our own questions we decided we weren't going to ask questions about things that had already been discussed we weren't going to ask about eight caught we weren't going to ask about rape kits we weren't going to ask about it she won those things have been covered in the previous two debates in Dayton in Marietta\nSo we try to find new ground we tried to ask them about Medicaid expansion in more specific than and pre existing conditions on what kind of governor\nUh we asked about the local government fined and about helping people re enter after leaving prison you know these issues that are really big that can potentially cost\nHundreds of millions of dollars for the state we wanted to know a little bit more information but somehow he caught and rape kits and issue on all of them come up because the candidates did have each Ninety seconds to answer the questions and then thirty seconds to what brought the original question\nA so they had their time to get their points in there but I I Do think we got some new information and that was really important\nWho wasn't there the libertarian candidate Travis Irvine Green Party candidate conscious Goodell Newton um why Joe the decision of the group not to include the minor party candidate fly\nIn the first year there was a decision what we want to do was put on the best possible debate that we could and so the decision was that we would ah we're focused on the two people who had the major party candidates who had a ... one of them will will almost surely be the next governor of Ohio\nWe would like in the future to go on and to have ... you know have more debates and have a different format of debates\nBut part of this was this broad based group which pain to go only really an interest in some ways it seems like it's been forever since April but in terms of actually getting something done including on something like this which started in ... at the at the very tail end of April [noise] um and it was a matter of what could you do in a relatively tight timeframe that we had to work with\nI ... I think to what we learned by the end is if we had to do it over and then we would have come up with you will you know but but but in this one I mean we decided not to including the motor party candidates and we what we probably would have would do differently as we would set some sort of threshold\nFor for deciding that that we ... we made some mistakes going through this we're fixing them for the next time I'm so that we can be more inclusive\nComing up uh on\nMore with treatment they don't want to fill the prisons with people who were addicted but the legislature doesn't do that\nWould vote for it I mean I'm I'm surprised this looks likely to pass because many many people believe it's a terrible policy to put this in the constitution\nWe'll sit there and I wanted to ask you earlier as we were consuming all of these ... stories and once we were going to talk about the idea that so many people have not just voted early but registration is it up with Mr ...\nWell yeah it is up and we're now up over eight million which is the fourth time I think in Ohio history that we've been up over eight million registered voters what's interesting though here is not just the voter registration but really the voter turnout I mean if turnout is going to be at\nWhat it was a twenty four team which was forty percent well that's a different level than if it was going to be at a forty nine percent of fifty percent\nWhere it was a twenty ten I mean these are two different levels so if if\nYou know granted a lot of potential registered voters are out there but the people who turn out that it's always what is most important and we saw that even in the twelfth district special election in August uh here in Columbus and in central Ohio but I think it's going to be key here with regard to all these races\nOr you know it when it comes back to issue one\nAh we ask my colleague into ... to as a from Ohio who works for the University of Virginia's saboteurs crystal ball newsletter about whether issues do drive turnout\nAnd and what which side could potentially issue one be supportive of and conduct said in his view is that it the issues really don't drive turnout and he said even going back to two thousand four when George Bush was on the ballot for reelection and we had in Ohio the defense of Marriage Act that he doesn't feel that that really drove turn out and help George Bush get reelected\nSo I'm interested to kind of test that theory and see if it does indeed have any impact here I mean certainly the groups that have come out\nAgainst issue one have been like you just said law enforcement and and some of these other groups\nI tend to be more on the progressive side ah so that's just something I think interesting going out okay\nWhen I hear from a state wide story the story this hyper local but getting a lot of attention lately confusion continuing this world and what will be held this week you may remember it was a week ago that mayor Robert Wagner served noticed is six uh seven city council members by email that he's removing them from office effective immediately the mayor pointing to a section of the city charter that grandson the authority to remove an employee\nFor actions that fall under categories like gross misconduct her mouth reasons this week\nA judge granted a request by the ousted council members who asked for a restraining order against the mayor\nChris does that mean for the time being they've gotten their jobs back\nAnd they actually had a a tense council meeting last night um what the judge found is there was a high high likelihood\nThat the ... decision would get tossed after a full hearing because marriage don't really have the ability to remove the legislative branch of government and so she ordered them back in order the mayor to let them back into the building because he had changed all the locks to keep them out\nUm another one of the lack of your local stories we've ever heard in this meeting last night there were a\nBunch of amendments to the charter that they wanted to push through\nUm I'm not aware of was reading an article on there actually are charter amendments that are on the ... that are on the um [noise]\nAre are are gonna be on the ballot next month in or if not considered an art is holding its over that they are on the ballot in ... and we'll be hills and they are about tipping the father of power relationship between the mayor and the council um in fact one of the things that I wasn't sure about the the judge who struck down in action is previously the judge has\nStruck down some of the council at at the behest of the mayor so I mean\nHere is really kind of play to write down the middle on\nRight I mean the mayor had a legitimate point that the council done some things they shouldn't have done in the courts resolved that he ... he just took it a step further saying well since they did something wrong that's malfeasance I'm tossing them and that's where the judges brought it back to normal it's hard to ...\nThat's what the voters to pick the leaders in the voters will go to the polls and and make some changes\nTo clear division but there are so strict sex\nSoldiers radio social media is goes on with the little campaigns across the state is a push commercials advertisements Miller's the voters of November wars we just mentioned no Jericho divorce displeasure about a mad campaigning against his or her opponent\nAnd there are adjustable GOP committee a GOP in Albany rather for our sister\nTwenty four Wednesday posted to his Facebook page a letter that he sent to Ohio Republican Portage urging jumped in and it exposes his concerns about a mayor that voters received encouraging a vote against his opponent in the route democratic ... Russo here and what about the ... to publicly say hey this is not what I believed to be true\nWell on there was a an allegation about how she might have been involved in uh the rainy day fund being trained in taxes being raised but the fact is that she was not an office and hasn't been an office and he pointed that out that he felt that it was really kind of a\n... well it's not fair to make this connection so to speak and and this is the letter that he posted on has a Facebook account I'm actually going to be able to talk to him and a couple of months after we get done here and I want to ask him a little bit more about this but um you know the uh what we have right now is we have Ninety One house districts in Ohio that are\nActually contest and Democrats are on the ballot Ninety nine house districts but there are some of those that are not contested but some of these are really consider to be very close especially in suburban areas and this is one of those\nAnd and so the idea is that when our voters going to split are they going to break for the Republicans are the Democrats and I think that there is a concern by Mr Yemen off that uh his district might be more sympathetic toward Alison Russo his opponent because of this negative ad campaign and he's very concerned about that\nRunning for office you've got people who are supportive of the current Speaker Ryan Smith people were supportive of the one who wants to be speaker Larry household her and and some of the campaign strategies that are going on behind the scenes here and and so there there's a lot of kind of inside baseball in a lot of these ah\nOhio house races and it's a it's very interesting\nWell this was a district that Hillary Clinton won no two years ago and ... was it while it currently has a Republican incumbent who's not seeking reelection um you know or care so it's just a sort of a classic suburban district where Republicans have to be concerned is here particularly concerned about what happens with women voters\nBut then so he was very micro it isn't no snow says voters statewide there's a lot of a sudden you know why I Would not be surprised or just ... cookie cutter type of attack ads against Democrats who\n... in other places around the state because people at the upper levels aren't they don't know that uh they don't do that and white crow stuff done at the ground over there I was thinking that they're thinking with abroad tactics as opposed to how it's actually going to play out on the on the gym and onto the neighbor low jerks\nYeah I'm I talked to some somebody yesterday with Iraq which is the ... the campaign arm of the Ohio house which is running campaigns for house incumbents\nAnd he even admitted to me that yeah there are some districts especially suburban districts that they're very concerned about and\nIt's ... and now district like this one where there isn't an income but this will be a district that the Republican Party would be involved in in terms of sending out what Joe was just talking about these these broad based mailers that really kind of speak two big issues\nThroughout the stage with regard to Republicans where they might not what plays in another part of the state might not necessarily play in a district like up early\nOkay let's move on thanks reformer Cleveland Police officer shot and killed twelve year old Tamir Rice

story um the Daily Beast that have decent take out on the chief down there who surprise surprise as a controversial figure and we take a controversial figure to hire a guy who shot Tamir Rice\nUm and and I think there was a lot of pressure on on Loma remember he wasn't fired for shooting right here he was fired because\nHe hadn't been honest on his application where you know he'd been found unfit to be a police officer previously which is another reason it's a little surprising bell or would hire him because because of that but I mean this is one of those stories that had nobody nobody could
