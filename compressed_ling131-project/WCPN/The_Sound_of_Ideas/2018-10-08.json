live at the east lake public library [noise]\nYou can here we've got to live and lively audience and we're here to talk about medical marijuana which is slowly moving toward reality in Ohio\nA little bit of background in June of twenty sixteen governor John Case excite how spill five twenty three establishing a medical marijuana program in Ohio the twenty six state to legalize medical cannabis the legislature passed a bill to head off a looming ballot issue\nThirty states now allow medical marijuana nine states in the district of Columbia also allow recreational marijuana and support is growing a\nGallup poll released last year showed record high support for legalizing marijuana for medical and recreational use sixty four percent nationwide\nStill Ohio voters and twenty Fifteen rejected a well financed ballot measure to legalize medical and recreational marijuana one that many saw as flawed because of his monopolistic awarding of growing privileges to specific investors House bill five twenty three was passed\nThe following year and the deadline for a fully operational medical marijuana industry was September eighth it's October still no product still know prescriptions\nIt bears noting that this is a whole new industry with tons of regulations where none existed before and really no one is surprised about missing the deadline there have been lawsuits administrative stumbles and construction delays but there's also been progress about\nThree hundred doctors have registered with the state to be able to prescribe marijuana treatment of patients a number of medical marijuana companies have begun hiring employees and if you cultivate hers have plants from the soil and the patient registry is ready to go live on the other pieces fall into place\nAllowed to start planting which it did in July plant should be ready for harvest later this year than every three weeks thereafter some cities Cleveland and pains bill for example passed laws banning marijuana facilities each lake struggling economically embraced it\nBuckeye relief purchased an abandoned community center that stood empty for Fifteen Years it's been converted into a sixty thousand square foot marijuana production facility featuring a product testing lab and cultivation rooms were about eight thousand plants are now growing\nThe notion that marijuana is worth at least trying in that state says we see the majority of them now have approved it in medical form\nI think that you can you can sort of say that but I think one of the main problems is that there have been really\nTremendous barriers to to actually be able to research the plant and so when you're asking for um you know scientific research medical research into the plant documents that you can look at sort of prove conclusions\nThat is still pretty scant or more anecdotally and just based on um other medical markets that have rolled out so far I mean there's there's a lot of evidence and again I Would probably to for the physicians on that and the patients that I mean overwhelmingly there is a consensus that's pretty much emerged at this point\nMayor you mentioned you had a town hall and you had been talking with people on the economic side of this what about from residents were or any residents concerned and then how did you uh lay any concerns they might have had I mean we had a few\nResidents were concerned at the town hall [noise] more the more concern was about ... what you just brought up about is it going to really help people or should we continue to do the standardized about us and of of the past\nLike to throw remind her out to those who are with us this evening we need to hear your voice so step on up to the Mike ... who are you and what's on your mind\nLibby from Canada way if CBD rich hemp oil is a non psychoactive therapeutic or ... or medicine why is it a legal in Ohio according to\nLike it's an extract right of the marijuana plant that isn't THC and is used in a Erica if you'll helped me here used in some products as as our guest is setters our audience members said it is illegal and is there a thought about the rationale on that\nUh it is well it's a great question it is I'm a like you to the other one of the other more neither major more visible a\nA ... in candidates and Ohio is joined a number of other states across the country and essentially cracking down on the sale of it\nUh for quite a while it's been available um essentially over the counter in various retail stores are and I don't mean dispensaries but just retail stores across across the state um\nWhere am I calling the number on the back of the guys car which I think was your car right Jonathan right another way to do I sure yeah in the parking lot [laughter] exactly\nUh you know online sales things like that um you know you're announcing fire sales across the state people just want to get rid of it I think part of it is um it's uh the way that I've sort of a compared it is it's a puzzle piece in\nIn Ohio's puzzle and right now they don't know where to put this puzzle piece on a regulatory level you know do you classified as a food ingredient as a can nab annoyed as a neutral suitable pharmaceutical\nAnd so right now it's not just in Ohio it's in limbo and all sorts of states\nOkay we're gonna take a quick break in the conversation now and say thank you to the mayor mayor thank you very much for being able to travel [noise]\nWe're going to be back with our other guest and we're going to welcome a new gas someone who hopes to benefit from medical marijuana\nWere coming to you from the east like

a bit later we're going to be talking with two doctors want a pain management specialist who plans to\nFor medical marijuana in Ohio which limits to potential patient population to those who have Twenty one specific conditions from Alzheimer's disease to multiple sclerosis the patient registry which was supposed to come on line of September has been delayed as a whole industry has been slow to get off the ground\nWe welcome now one of the patients Amanda can do America has multiple sclerosis and she lives just down the road and what would be welcome\nI think for a nice to have you with us [noise]\nAlso staying with us is Andrew Rayburn CEO of Buckeye relief and Eric Sandy digital editor of cannabis business times and cannabis to spend three magazine\nAmanda you got the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis sclerosis pretty young in your late twenties uh tell me about the pain that was associated with that\nSo I was actually diagnosed like you said when I was twenty seven years old and um I found out in kind of a dramatic fashion I'm I was starting out problems locking my toys dragging when I was walking\nAnd I was seen in the emergency room and it was the only visit I'd been seen and they told me that they thought I had I must\nI was scheduled to have a number I two weeks later and one week later of one week before my MRI I got the flu and I went to take a nap and I woke up and I was paralyzed from my trust all the way down\nI couldn't move my legs on their own Eddie's my arms when my legs I couldn't walk and feel anything um and I couldn't even stand them things anymore so I was admitted to the hospital for seven days um they came back with\nThe diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and um it takes a kind of a while to get started on medications on they just treat the symptoms from us\nAnd one of the biggest symptoms I have is um muscles toughness in my lower body on so my legs have spasms constantly and it's ...\nKnow that was released from the hospital they didn't give me anything for pain and I just remember laying in bed and complaining like my legs they hurt so bad I Wish it would just stop and I'm actually at that time somebody offered me a joint on marijuana joint and\nEyes not a doctor not a doctor now [laughter]\nAnd ice melted and it was an aha moment from the very first time and prior to that I had actually been against marijuana in general like I knew people who use it and they're no good and you know I had a very negative opinion about a marijuana and people use dead but as soon as I tried it\nThis time because it's not like I never used that when I was younger but I knew right away that this was different and something was helping me the pain was gone and my legs I could move easier and as soon as it started wearing off I knew that I needed to do that again\nAnd it was the first time that it ever happened to me so it was really crazy\nSo you were twenty subtle when you're diagnosed yet or how many years went by before you started understanding that marijuana was hoping you\nSo after a year I had a relapse where I lost all those other strengthen my lower body I was in a wheelchair for nine months and I was in a hospital this time for ten days and this time without medical marijuana\nUm and I just kept getting worse and worse every single day and I thought maybe this is because my on us I don't know they gave me um small muscle relax their which then adversely affected my liver\nUm and shot in my liver panel numbers all the way up so they had to immediately take me off of that and when I got home I smoked and I was fine and I literally burst into tears because I had a realization of how much it had been benefiting my quality of life up until that point\nAnd this was how many years than a one year since many years have you been using it do it now and she doesn't want and okay so so it's been a number of years\nBut then they stopped like you build a tolerance it's the same kind of\nThing so you called and

[noise]\nAnd also staying with us as Eric Sandy he's the digital editor of cannabis business times in cannabis dispensed free magazine based here in northeast Ohio\nAudience it is important that we include your thoughts on this conversation a few if you were lined up more of you can at the microphone will stay as long as it takes to answer your questions and get your comments involved in the conversation let's talk about medical marijuana\nFrom the doctor's perspective a Dr Kim you were one of the first doctors to sign up to start recommending patience for medical marijuana back in February\nWhy were you so quick to sign up\nAll my patients I'm doing the pain management so I deal with a lot of about opioid related problems my patients\nReally asked me to apply for this because they wanted to a ... some odd options because there's really if the opioid doesn't work there's nothing else you can try and stop\nA patient if the patron ask for more opioid okay because they are asking ... that's what we say\nSo patience cannot even get pain medicine and the pain is escalating what what do they do so they tried to go out and look for some\nIllegal drugs and eventually they get into trouble back there well over ten thousand people are dying from this opioid epidemic every year so I decided to uh apply for it\nTo help the patient and I I did so much research and then I went to the education program\nAnd I found this could really open up the new uh horizon hope this you know chronic pain management so I got accepted and I started to write this recommendation and then I don't know how they\nGot this a medical marijuana but they managed to get it from somehow and then they all come back and say\nReally changed my life ... you just like a a man by saying you know they every day I get hog from my patient all Dr Kim you save my life my life has changed so much\nIn those cases you've given him a recommendation they haven't bought it legally because we don't have that uh we don't have that mechanism in place yet but by giving them the recommendation at some point very soon with this patient ... registry\nYou'll have essentially a card that says until it is up and running a I have a doctor's recommendation yeah so that that's what that means let me let Dr parent jump in and we'll get back to some stuff on this doctor parent you've done a lot of research to your an addiction specialist and your deal with the very people that Dr King was talking about that do get hooked\nAre you a person who doesn't see marijuana but definitely the same way some of these other doctors do\nWell I think that I and many doctors think about marijuana itself as a plant that has twenty some different can have annoyed in it of various uh potency concentration\nOr some of those can nab annoys are useful medical medications THC for example is a useful medical medication\nThat's been available by prescription since Nineteen eighty five and I've prescribed it to people with cancer chemotherapy problems with HIV wasting syndrome et cetera\nI think CBD as we heard about earlier today is a very interesting medical medication which has been purified and now is available in the wealth is licensed by the FDA in the U.S has a schedule five drug\nMany of us thought it should be a non scheduled drug um for use in specificity disorders or and for use in chronic pain syndromes uh without the THC involved in it\nA CBS in I think is the third can nab annoyed that many people are very interested in from a research standpoint that may have some anti inflammatory effect et cetera\nUm but as a physician I my my approach to a patient is to if possible um identify a I'm a single entity a with a known concentration\nWith a demonstrated toxic therapeutic ratio meaning the the dose that can be toxic and the dosage therapeutic [noise]\nI'm a for different age groups of patients um and then to prescribe that\nThere is research is as Eric mentioned earlier there hasn't been a ton of research about smoking marijuana or the kind of medical marijuana that we've been talking about but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence and we heard some of that from the doctor to your right and from the patient I was sitting in a chair\nInteresting it's important for individual patients and it changes some patients lives as we heard from Amanda\nBut anecdotal evidence is not the evidence that typically drives the practice of medicine anecdotal evidence provides an indications for research indications for new initiatives um\nAnecdotal evidence brought us the opiate epidemic to be perfectly honest anecdotal evidence from individual patients who said opioids changed my life and fix my pain and then doctors began to recommended widely ah and we uh have learned to read the consequences\nMexico Russia from the audience just ma'am\nHi my name is Brenda I kinda got here by accident I was looking into the on computer trying to find something for my husband he has cancer or he just all of a sudden it started like a about march or he\nWas in so much pain and had no realization when people say that you know cancer causes pain oh my God you just have no idea how bad it is [laughter]\nOkay so he went for chemo treatment the pain it started to go away to a degree of five he's a marine so he's a pretty tough dude I can imagine that that five is still pretty bad\nThat's a nine for the rest of us from probably\n[noise] um so he had he had taken on the opioid the opioids made him he said it felt like he was getting crazy and it made him so constipated he refused to take them after that so there was nothing else so he just dealt with it and it was still at a five and it has been the chemo treatment\nDidn't work any more he was in the hospital for three times as this month I says what else is there for him and so that's why I'm here today you know to find out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "city": "Cleveland",
