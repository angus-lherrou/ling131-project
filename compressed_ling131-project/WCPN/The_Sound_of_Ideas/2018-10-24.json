Robert sprayed\nBut first if it's ... innovations time that means it's Mike Rosen time Dr Mike Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic the cheap wellness author joins us now going to have you with us or\nIt's great to be here nice to have you and he always walks us through this list so it's really always an exciting time and we just get the benefit of this announcement and then you have the big reveal at the innovation some it but it's a lot of work that goes into this sort of a what a docks right\nSo we interview a hundred and fifty docks to get their suggestions about twenty investors or venture capitalists and about ten people in the media and from that list we have two hundred and fifty to three hundred ideas\nHere's meet 'em over a about a five hour dinner sometimes it's longer than that and vote on it and then there's another elimination the two groups don't know what each other voted on or how they voted\nThe top about twenty five from those two meetings then go through another elimination to get the tax and so these are advances in Madison\nThat will be here the next year that is it's got to be something that's clinically relevant for two thousand and Nineteen and has a enough\nAnd so after that stent went in the spent lasted over four hundred days wow and it was only because I told the FDA we would take it out of the year um again to be consistent with other guidelines and so on reducing his a need for procedures from every month every year or it can be a significant improvement\nWhat kind of materials are we talking about for these stunts are they is that changing as well\nActually no so what's the beauty of uh our particular project is that the three D printing is made to make the mold on but we're using medical grade silicone that has been around since the nineties as our material\nBut amazing that you can essentially I Would think it's in real time if you need a if you need a device that would be pretty quickly made you don't have to wait for delivery\nWell for this case or the current technology that we're working on it takes about a week or we use the patients CAT scan like I said we can make a three dimensional prescription that prescription is degenerated into a mold that mold is what's what three D printed a weed pressure inject the silicone into that mold and undo some post processing and we can get that into the patient within about a week\nMike we're talking about the use of of three D printing for a stent it would seem to me that when you think about three ... printing and what will be five years or ten years from now the possibilities seem endless well\nActually are being endless now so when we're talking at the innovation somewhat about the face transplant some of that material was three D printed you\nSo and enough three D printers now needed that this is the year you know we've had you know ... has had the promise for ten years it's been there we now know enough of the snips we know enough of the clinical events\nThat it is this is the year we think there will be a breakthrough and it will make major critical difference same thing with ... D printing you've heard about three D printing people have them you know as as toys if you will um to do other things but now they're getting good enough\nPrograms are getting good enough the uses getting good enough the FDA's is on board enough um it's one of the great things that ... that Scott Gottlieb has done is advance of the speed of\nOf approval of the things the FDA director right that we're now getting um the ability to rapidly change and rapidly make the advances and so it's thought the the bronze cast can be sense the other\nUses of ...
