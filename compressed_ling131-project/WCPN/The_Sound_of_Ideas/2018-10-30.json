theory it works because the people decide on candidates ballot issues and so on its elections that give governments their mandates and their legitimacy but\nThere's an important distinction here the way it actually works out it's not the people who decide its voters and those can be two very different groups\nAt the establishment of the republic voters included only white male landowners obviously the right to vote the franchise has expanded considerably over the years but the history of American politics is a story of this in franchise meant as well systematic and deliberate exclusions that continue to the present day\nOnly understand is a professor of African American studies at Emory University her books include white rage and most recently one person no vote how voter suppression is destroying our democracy\nShe joined us from a conference room there at Emory\nWelcome to the democracy test Carole thank you so much for having me Heather history in a minute but you described for women I remember the whole problem of making sure that you're official name match the name under which you voted and of course the only women whose names tend to change when they're adults I always thought that was fascinating\nWomen come in with all of these documents only to be turned away because of the documents aren't lining up with who they say they are and what makes this so infuriating is that all of this mess about voter id is predicated on a lie\nThe lie of voter fraud the lie of massive rampant voter fraud\nAnd that lie has consistently been targeted at the city's saying that in the cities we have\nPeople who are impersonating other people and voting multiple times they're voting from using vacant lots as addresses their you know coming under dead people's names and voting and\nYou tell a lie enough times that it begins to sound like the truth and that's where we are right now so predicated on the lie of voter fraud then we're able to create this almost like rockstar fire\nThat democracy is in peril in only these mechanisms will save democracy but those mechanisms like voter id in fact\nDamage destroy\nThe voting rights of American citizens\nWe said earlier that at the beginning of the republic voting rights warming extended to white male landowners and you know we like to think that there's a story of a steadily expanding franchise is that right\nQuite [laughter] um [laughter] you know it histories about changing continuity and going back and having to redo it all over again so we get this movement um an Eighteen sixty seven the franchises expanded to black men\nWith the reconstruction activating sixty seven then in Eighteen Seventy we get the fifteenth amendment that says that the right to vote should not be abridged on account of race color\nLike Eighteen Ninety we get the Mississippi Plan of Eighteen Ninety which is a tool kit of massive disenfranchisement\nAnd that massive disenfranchisement hit African Americans hard really hard to bring voter registration down to the single digits for instance in Mississippi\nAnd in some counties in Georgia and Alabama it was zero percent when you say voter registration you're speaking of African American voter registration yes yes but what the Mississippi Plan also did\nDo tend to vote like their husbands until the gender gap begins in Nineteen eighty that's when we get the beginning of the gender gap and it's grown ever since until it is now at the largest it's ever been in American history which is I think one of the reasons that people are don't quite know what to do with the day's politics\nBecause women are not behaving the way they have in the past and no one quite knows what's gonna happen with that\nYou mean this women behaving badly thing where women there are certainly saying yes [laughter] right you know that this kind of thing going you know what we should get equal pay for equal work what we should have control of our bodies\nUm we should have the kinds of protections that when our our rights and our bodies are violated\nThat the system works as well for us as it does for those who\nAre doing the violating equality before the law [laughter] oh my gosh\n[laughter] and and and you and we're absolutely seeing that right now frankly\nI'm with this Kavanaugh debacle you've talked about a lot of different things that go into voter suppression what worries you the most what's the most important it all\nTies together I think the one that I find the most pernicious because it's the most hidden is gerrymandering um earlier you had talked about the redrawing of these districts and of course the redrawing of the districts is constitutionally mandated and it's supposed to be done by a legislative body after\nFor of representatives that each state should have in the U.S Congress except the way that it's been done and I mean we started out I mean Patrick Henry gerrymandered to try to to keep James Madison out of the U.S Congress so\nWe've got a long nap me history of of gerrymandering but what has happened since then after the twenty ten election it took on a kind of\nIt's it's like on anabolic steroids or something I'll talk about Wisconsin and because it's representative of what's going on around this nation\nIn Wisconsin after the twenty ten election a handful of Republicans basically sequestered themselves away in a hotel\nAnd using powerful computer driven mapping software I'm began to read draw the districts the congressional and the legislative districts\nThey had two goals one was to eliminate as much as possible the number of competitive districts so they were packed\nAs many Republicans as possible into one district in as many Democrats as possible into another\nYes to do that in a way so that you'd have disproportionate populations in a district\nBut also what happens with non competitive districts are people feel like the game as rigged it doesn't matter if I'd vote or not vote because they're going to win anyway and so people stay home they're demoralized that's what non competitive districts do they drive\nA depression in voter turnout the second goal for the Republicans was to say that regardless of how many votes they received they would always get\nThe way that a democracy works regardless of how many votes we will always get the majority the maps that they drew\nThey were powerful maps to the point where no Democrats were allowed in the process at all\nAnd the Republicans who weren't in that room we're only allowed to see their district but they had to find a nondisclosure agreement in order to see that district in the twenty twelve election using these newly drawn maps Democrats received fifty two percent of the vote\nAnd gained thirty nine percent\nOf the seats in the state legislature\nAnd to be fair or Republicans would argue that Democrats did pretty much the same thing in a state like Maryland it's just there's Republicans control more states than Democrats due to the point\nWhere I think looking to the twenty Eighteen mid term elections projections are that if Democrats hope to win control of the house of representatives or they have to win something like fifty six fifty seven percent of the vote\nExactly that kind of imbalance does violence to the constitutional concept of one person one vote\nAnd where it also does violence is that because of the ways these districts have been drawn like in Pennsylvania where Republicans receive forty nine percent of the vote but Seventy two percent\nOf the congressional seats is that it has put somewhere between sixteen to twenty six additional GOP seats in Congress\nAnd it's created these kind of rotten boroughs where politicians are able to choose their electorate instead of the electorate choosing them and so they are immune in some ways from the will of the voters\nAnd you talked about dispiriting voters\nDocumentation an all these different mechanisms they act to corrode democracy to destroy people's faith in what's going on\nYes exactly I'll take Ohio for instance I'm an early voting was put in place to try to expand access to the voter booth\nBecause having elections on a Tuesday in November that's generally your work day for a lot of folks and so being able to to get to vote and then get to work when you've got a punch the clock is very difficult\nSo early voting provides access to people particularly working class people\nTo be able to fully participate in American democracy what Ohio did on the surface it looks equitable Ohio said we will have one early voting site for each county wow each county gets one except the counties are very different\nUh Cuyahoga County loose right Cuyahoga River in Cleveland got our county right exactly a has one point two five million people that's a big county\n[noise] what happens then is that you have lines hours long lines in these big county's like Franklin County with Columbia Columbus and Hamilton County uh with Cincinnati\nAnd people are able to just fly through in these smaller counties what they did in North Carolina for instance in Mecklenburg county where Charlotte is\nAnd Charlotte has about seven hundred and fifty thousand people and Fifteen Percent of the states ... black population lives there\nThey reduce the number of early polling sites from twenty two to four twenty two [laughter]\nWrangling early voting sites this way they were like wow in the twenties sixteen or election in early voting there were like\nAfrican American early voter turnout is down by eight point five percent yes I mean how do you congratulate yourself for denying American citizens the right to vote\nCarol Anderson thank you very much thank you Neal thank you so much Carol

been the repercussions of what's changed since then [noise]\nOne big thing that happened in Montana which I think is a kind of a shining example for the rest of the U.S is that campaign disclosure laws were passed and there was a bill in two thousand and Fifteen and it was called the DISCLOSE Act\nAnd uh that basically specified all sorts of different ways in which the source of funding needs to be disclosed\nThat dark money loophole isn't completely closed because that is something that needs to happen at the federal level but one thing that states can do is to emphasize how much disclosure needs to happen you know ... who who are the funders behind these groups\nUm there's a lot of ways that states can mandate that all of this information is put on line very quickly so that voters can know where this money is coming from before the elections\nHappened when one of the things that I think it's really important to know when you're talking about this and about the dark money coming into Montana and elsewhere\nIs that it's targets are not simply Democrats as targets are Democrats and Republicans anybody who seems to be considered too moderate and not really with the movement conservative agenda you want to talk a little bit more about that\nYeah you know the basic architecture of our film is watching Republicans to some describe them as moderate all although I I mean these guys are pretty conservative Republicans it's not like these are these are squishy Republicans that we're talking to\n... no not at all um these guys are are really ... you know Republicans but they're attacked by a people within their own party that just feel like they don't represent the the ideals that they want their\nIt's only Republicans who are involved in dark money spending\nActually over the course of their six years that it's taken me to make this phone\nI think you have to be fair and admit that this dark money spending was really developed and I would say weaponized at the federal level\nBy the political right but more and more I'm seen this money spent on the political left for example in the nomination fight for judge Kavanaugh there was a bunch of money spent by five oh one C. four group she advocate for the\nNomination of judge Kavanaugh but there was also another group it's that sprang up to oppose that and it did so by using a five on she for dark money group it's important to notice a couple of things with that one is\nJust this very basic fact that ... when we're talking about dark money spending we're not just talking about candidates running for elected office that we're also talking about judicial nominations and sometimes elections\nAnd so let's think about\nHow dark money function in those judicial nominations I don't know who spent money to get Kavanaugh nominated you don't know who spent money to get happened on nominated but she has this our cabin I'll probably knows who's spent money to get cabin on nominated and how are we ever to\nKnow whether there should be a recusal in a case that comes before him how do we know if there was any sort of influence that was operating and not nomination fight\nAnd I think it's just important to to realize just how especially pernicious anonymous money is when it comes to either the election or a nomination of judicial appointees campaign finance is a pretty\nIt's a really fundamental issue I mean regardless of which political issue that you're passionate about\nAnd which side of the political aisle you're on and it doesn't matter\nBut you can't really figure out any of those political issues until you figure out who's funding it and we're all this money is coming from and where that influences to be honest I didn't quite know what to do with it for a couple of years and chill in two thousand and twelve I saw that my home state of Montana\nOr was going to defend this corrupt practices act of Nineteen twelve that we discussed earlier\nAnd that that case was going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and when that happened it was sort of an a ha moment is like oh this is how we can tell the story of money in politics how we have this strong historical\nResidents how we can wrap it around real people talking about real stuff and not just have this abstract discussion about money and going into this campaign are into that campaign\nBut then I could talk to the attorney general in Montana who is you know bringing up this very important historical case where I could talk to people like Republican candidate for office and John Ward who we discussed earlier who\nWas blindsided by a group called you know mothers against child predators who was comparing him to John Wayne Casey\nAnd last but certainly not least is a journalist named John Adams\nWho was a reporter on the ground that was following all of these issues to money and politics and\nInitially in our film is kind of the lens through which we see this whole discussion play out but when he actually gets laid off and faces a lot of the challenges that the rest of the newspaper in just\nTo have great investigative reporters following these issues of money in politics but he also becomes emblematic of\nYeah what's going on with with the press in general and the newspaper industry in those financial challenges that newspapers are going through across the country today and um how important it is to\nTo follow the money how much you really need to have investigative reporters who were on the case who are who are ah hunting down these stories\nSpeaking to follow the money you're you even argue in the film that campaign finance was at the heart of the greatest political drama of our of our by my lifetime anyway you'd be younger than me and that's what I did\nYeah that's right the former FCC chairman andme rabble a tells a story about you know even the most people\nRemember Watergate as a probably probably through the lens of all the President's Men for good reason\nBut why don't get really started and ended as a campaign finance scandal it started with your suitcases full of cash on the floor of the oval office uh that were there to pay off the people who broke into the Watergate hotel\nAnd the whole mechanism that they had to buy these people off\nWas hiding money a that was coming from political contributions so it really was a dark money scandal\nAnd the whole campaign finance system that we're dealing with today\nReally came about because it was such public outcry against the sort of corruption but once again we're talking about ways to hide money in political campaigns and if folks are looking for for hope these days and times said um I think there's a lot\nThere was a lot of reform that came about in the wake of Watergate and um if if you're looking for help I think it's it's not unreasonable to see ourselves in the same situation and and be prepared ourselves for another wave of reform in the wake of the\nCorruption that we're hearing about today Thanks very much thank you so much for having me Kimberly reached film is called dark money\n\nHow do we spend a lot of this hour in the Jim Crow south and dark money Montana I wanted to put voting rights and consent of the government into some intellectual and historical context where do these ideas come from well this goes\nAll the way back to what we were talking about the very beginning of this series with Danielle Alan ... enlightenment concept of consent of the Gulf War and the idea that maybe the universe or God or whomever did not deliberately put some man on earth better than others\nThat maybe there aren't people who really should run the government should control the way everybody else lives\nAnd during the enlightenment we get the concept that maybe all men are created equal maybe people really should have the right to consent to their government well if that's the case\nThen if everybody is equal how do you decide what sort of policy should work\nThe idea is under enlightenment thinking\nThat the more ideas you have on the table and the better argued they are the more likely it is that regular people will make good decisions about their lives that what you really need to have is an informed population that deals with fact and with evidence and with argument rabbits and was superstitions and traditions\nSupport for coverage of

Studio ... Adams he's the director of the Lorraine county board of elections good morning ... also joining us from Orlando is Candace hope\nFounding co director of the center for cyber security and privacy protection at Cleveland State University Good morning Kansas good morning\nAnd legislation make our elections accurate transparent and verifiable good morning you're in a good morning\nAll right well we'll start with Candace here I just want to throw this out for a general opening question here do you think that we have made some improvements since twenty sixteen when there was some real concerns\nWe definitely have I'm In Ohio as well as the nation there has been a much more concerted effort\nTo face up to the realities the ... of of our election in security\n... brings up a very good point about you know paper ballots are not necessarily by themselves\nOr something that solves any kind of issues or concerns with the integrity the election because paper ballots have to be scanned in in or put a memory cards so there is that piece that occurs regardless of whether it's on a touch screen with a voter verified paper trail or if it's on paper\nUm and he is correct there's a there's an awful lot of auditing in a work that needs to be done properly at a board of elections and in particular just over the last five or six years\nWell we've seen is an increase in requirements of audits that are done after elections even one ... recounts are not required after this election every county in the state of Ohio is required to hold an audit it'll be open to the public\nYou voters across the entire state can come in and watch board of elections officials\nActually take either the paper ballots themselves or the voter verified paper trail and compare those to the electronic results to show that those those results do match\nAnd Kansas and Mary and I want to ask you both about this and I'll start with Candace ... is that enough in terms of showing transparency\nIs certainly an important beginning the post election audits are critical um our our center at Cleveland State actually initiated and conducted the first post election audit in Ohio and two thousand six and a state election a directive came out shortly thereafter\nI'm a Marion can speak even more to this because she has been a leading the national effort for much more robust I'm a ...\nTo um correct for an accurate tabulation so if I could defer to Marion Marion go ahead\nOh well the caller raises two points and I want to address one of them which is that the the\nPrecinct voting devices are programmed by a regular computer laptop at it's at ... at the county jurisdiction or outsourced as Kansas mentioned\nEarlier and if there is now where or an error on that computer that can\nTranslate to all of the precinct voting devices to that's true but he was incorrect about the ballots being printed the printed that can be printed in advance in Pennsylvania where I vote they ballots are blank the voter marks and with a pet her pencil and are scanned but it's correct that the computer in the scanner could be impacted\nWhether by an error or malware and that's why you must do as a robust on it after the fact check on that software and our board members and one of our staff members have um\nCreated the theory behind what's called a risk limiting audit which uses statistical methods to identify how many ballots need to be sampled in a particular race you know whether to the U.S Senate or congressional race or state representative the University of ballots that race and you\nDo random sample of those ballots to check that on the software we\nWon't get down into the weeds but that's a it's it's it's not enough that paper you have to look at it after the fact\nAnd I was just going to ask an income for this question out there there are some critics who say that paper ballots are the most secure system now in Ohio like I said even if you're on an electronic voting machine or a optical scan machines there is a motor verifiable paper trail lots that in Ohio law\nBut let me ask you can't us all start with you the idea of paper ballots as being the most secure it feels for a lot of people like that will be moving back if counties when they were placed their voting machines would actually go to that kind of a system\nIn computer security uh they all recognize and affirm that\nPaper is our best friend it's reliable it can't be universally hacked from uh any uh five thousand miles away any place on the planet we have a paper record that can be stored it can be I counted in on site\nAnd um so we don't have to depend on software that may cheat so we need to understand that at this point\nSoftware cannot be trusted uniformly we must always check on it banks do um\nUh they're required to by law health institutions for health care records required by law we need to do it by law and have robust auditing and the election system this is the foundation of our government and our ours ours civic\nI'm a society so we should I value it and and put in place the kinds of procedures that we need\nIs appalling the ask you a ... counties do in Ohio get the opportunity to choose the voting machines that they want their this is not a directive from the secretary's day that we all have to use the same thing which uniformity can be good it can be bad it depends on what your point of view is that certainly locals get the opportunity to do that what would that look like if if\nA county the size of Lorraine county went to paper ballots\nWhile I Will say specific to Lorraine county a paper ballot for us would be a quite expensive because we're one of the two counties in the state that have to have bilingual ballots so our our ballots are longer a Cuyahoga County in the state of Ohio that has to have a bilingual ballot\nUm when we look at going to paper ballots I Will mention that because the state legislature has provided funding for new voting equipment uh most of your listeners are going to see new voting equipment\nAt some point over the next year year and a half counties are going to be purchasing new types of voting equipment in really at this point\nAn actual touch screen like we have now with marine county that has a voter verified paper trail on it\nIs most likely going to fade away because there are very few vendors that are actually developing that type of technology anymore I Know there's a lot of there's a lot of talk of the security risks I think that that is\nFiltered into the vendors a radar and to my knowledge was only one in the state of Ohio that about boards of elections would even be able to look at purchasing at this point\nNow that means that there's paper and there's also a system called hybrid system to where you would\nVote the ballot on a on a similar touch screen that that you would see now with the regular touch screen unit but then a ballot cord would come out of the machine would be able to look at it and then you would put it into a optical scan reader like you would do an optical scan ballot Mary and you want to jump in there I think\nThat I felt that one of the things that Paul said was I'm not quite accurate there are actually four or five a\nVoting systems on the market now that have a leather user interface as a touch screen or some other most of them do have a touch screen user interface\nAnd they have assistive devices for voters with disabilities and they do print out the voters elections on a card that can then be scanned the most important thing to note here so we have to have that a paper ballot\nThat's cane for recounts an audits in order to check the software that otherwise there's no way of knowing whether there is a problem\nWith the software or with the election result the second thing is we have to separate the tabulation from the marketing and so there are four or five vendors that have devices exactly has he described that print out the ballot and then it it's inserted into a scanner\nAnd um I think it's really important that\nAh those those ... those devices are at it\nAbout using assistive devices that that's fine but they're putting it in the scanner separately is what's important\nProbably wouldn't make a quick on it and I might take a cough or that yeah I wanted to make the hybrid systems or that type of system where the tabulation occurs on a separate unit in a while there may be other companies throughout the country right now they're looking for actual full ... the touch screens that we currently have in Ohio or some counties\nRight now there's only one company that's moving forward certification in Ohio you need to observe ... federally in at the state level to be certified here let's turn to bill and north home what do you have a comment you want to make here\nGood morning ah this is an important topic uh nothing's more important to democracy and be able to account of votes but I'm curious to know about their relatives important so to say there are other threats to um the results reflecting\nThe voters preferences uh their claims that there is a voter fraud I understand that that much of a serious threat a billion after ... billion votes over Fifteen Years they'll there were more uh stabbed wished a fraudulent votes are there were there were fewer of established a fraudulent votes\nThat will be sitting around the table at Thanksgiving at our house around thirty that led to a voter are reducing voter participation\nAnother decrease in the ability of the voters to influence the system then there's well just last night on frontline a discussion of foreign in this case Russia's ah influencing an election results another example of how a there's a threat\nYeah I went out of high oh God I don't know how there's one more and it's\nA ... which one that is the Republicans have gerrymandered districts to discourage the potency of democratic votes by roughly ... percent so relative to those threats to voter of uh influence what about these tactical is where where do they fit in the process\nAnd I want to add one more here the whole idea of the erosion of trust and and the concern that as we are talking about all these things people might decide that they don't trust the actual outcomes only start with you\nDifficulties with our election system right now but we are\nVery much are are aware of them they're not only the non profits but the election officials are at every level\nThe last three years so the list is probably over inflated by between three and four hundred thousand voters\nSo actually there's probably about seven point eight million people who are eligible to vote in Ohio those others have a primarily moved er and er either registered someplace else or I'm left the state of Ohio so there's a new book it's on our role is correct\nAnd we're talking about the Supreme Court case ah that ah upheld Ohio's way of maintaining a total roles critics call that purging voters and this is just a six year process by which if you don't vote for two years then you either have to vote or you have to interact with the board of elections over the next four years or ... the rent\nYeah and recently the searchers states um made some other options available for example when you go in and renew your license plate or you're automatically a re entered in the pool so you don't have to do anything other than and you have to renew your license every four years so it's going to catch most people\nIn northeast Ohio plays an outside role in all of these registered voters they're more voters registered northeast Ohio thirty seven percent of those eight million voters are here in northeast Ohio writes\nYeah uh the shirt in northeast Ohio is declining somewhat but it's still by far the dominant a part of the state and that's why you can spend a lot of time years it's voter rich for both Democrats and Republicans\nAnd indeed that President Trump supposed to be here election eve at a rally at the center so that kind of speaks to the whole idea there are more voters potentially here and there are other regions the state\nYeah always give questions about where candidates go and they said was a Republican go to Cleveland is so democratic well the truth of the matter is that there's more Republican votes in northeast Ohio than there is any place else in stages like there's more democratic votes so he's going to be speaking to those Republicans in this part of the states\nAnd right now the congressional district that has the most voters is actually the one in central Ohio and just had the special election and that kind of speaks to a little bit of what you were talking about with the state is not updated its voter rolls since the Supreme Court case\nHasn't been maintained it hasn't been purged as you said I'm so it's a little difficult to look at voter rolls this year\nSo let's talk about this idea of a blue wave and that's been something that a national media has has really seized on in the last two election cycles and in terms which you show on your website ah these governors races in particular has been very very red in the last two cycles right\nWell Ohio is a red state in off year elections that has been since the Nineteen nineties and it's a purple state in presidential elections in that's based on turnout\nI'm In presidential elections more Democrats turnout than in non presidential years and when they do turn out at make selections\nA more competitive in Ohio so few have higher turnout I'm In this off year or the race will be more competitive we haven't had a close a governor's race\nOr we've only had one uh recently and that was in two thousand and ten and that was decided by two points in John Case six favor but since Nineteen eighty two um most of our elections for governor have been blowouts\n'em and since Nineteen Ninety or the governor's office has been controlled by a Republican except for one four year period\nIt's that's interesting because I I think on your website you track that there have been sixty six elections for governor six of them had been decided by less than a point but most of them you say our ... our our blow out there they're bigger results\nYeah uh those six or ... or ... or ... pretty old now uh in uh Nineteen Seventy four of that election was a between the gym Rosen and Gilligan was decided by eleven thousand votes that was one vote per precinct my point zero three seven percent\nOr in fact a John Gilligan went to bed thinking he had won that election and Jim Rose wanted to begin you lost the election and the next morning the result was different than that\nFind out what will happen and how long will have to wait but I guess when you start looking at everything we've got a ten year high potentially in the number of registered voters it's got an unpopular president ... that seems to be the set up for a blue wave what uh what can you tell from the numbers\n[noise] yeah I think that ah when you're looking at the numbers doesn't look like there's going to be a blue wave state wide is definitely going to be more Democrats voting in this off year election the normal\nBut I think what you're like Lucy is some blue tornados touched down in Ohio a house districts a state house districts where you're going to see a suburban districts in particular that had been reliably Republican are probably going to either go Democrat or be very very close\nAnd when you talk about very close to the governor's race I mean the polls there's a poll from pall mall is that shows that polls have shown that this is going to be one of those closer races forgotten\nYeah it looks like it's going to be a that's where all the indications are and ah so election nights going to be very interesting from election statistics important\nNow when you go down through whoever wins the governor's office ... there's a hotel the fact that it it's pretty clear it seems like\nThere's no question about it or if you look over the last\nSeveral election cycles a if the governor is a Democrat democratic elected in the governor's Republican or Republican is going to like a dumb down the ticket I think it's thirty three out of thirty six races since Nineteen eighty two whoever's won the governor's office has won the rest of the statewide offices\nAnd also we've got this is an ... an unique year and that we've got a candidate for governor and a candidate for US Senator they tend to be the same party that wins the polls are certainly showing that Sharon Brown and is doing well but but that's not always the case the person the party wins the governor's office doesn't always win the U.S Senate race\nWell more importantly than that I'm with the statistics show is there's always a pretty big spread\nThey're about Fifteen points different or even when the same party a Wednesday it's so it's not going to be unusual to see a big spread between what the Senate candidate gets and what the governor canned goods and what that means is the voters are making an individual choice on the candidates they have to select from in both of those races\nAnd in some cases the or unaffiliated voters are deciding to vote for the Republican and in some cases they're deciding vote for the Democrat and in that same election\nNow it's simplistic to say this but the turnout is really what's important here I mean we can have as many registered voters as as there are people but really it matters who actually does request and early ... and early ballot and turn it back in or cannot vote on election yeah and I had ...\nPeople turned over complicate this but it it really just gets down to that\nNow several states have already recorded turnout has been hired this year than it was an twenty fourteen we're not at that point it looks like we're on track to be higher than twenty fourteen which was kind of an outlier year because of the weakness of the top of the ticket but we're not going to come to our twenty sixteen levels are we\nWe're going to be between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen and I and we're going to be closer to twenty sixteen in terms of turnout overall turnout than we were twenty fourteen\nI think we're going to be higher than a two thousand and ten\nWhere we had fifty percent turnout I think we could be a fifty five percent turnout this year at the top and but you know what's going to be significantly higher it was forty percent in two thousand and fourteen which was an all time low in mid year election for regional elections\nAnd that ten percent makes a huge difference it it it it's I mean that that's a huge number of potential voters that didn't show up in twenty fourteen who did and twenty\nYeah ... percent of the millions eight hundred thousand that's a lot of lot of people\nNow one of the things that's quite often talked about is the youth vote or this year young voters are saying that they're going to turn out they're very excited about this year's election a new poll\nYeah yeah I hear that in every election and it turns out not to be true um the fact of the matter is that the highest percentage of youth vote or was in the Obama's first election in two thousand and eight and that was fifty five percent\nIn the last presidential election it was less than forty percent and in the last uh uh governor's election in two thousand and fourteen it was twelve point four percent so I'll see it ... I Believe it when I see it\nNow what do you think the statistics on the campaign to be looking at a week from tonight well\nOn election night they're going to be looking at a at the absentees there uh the first report that comes into the secretary of state's office at the local board report is all absentees\nAnd so they're going to look at those results and they're going to see what they say because that's going to be everybody ... who has voted so far and if Republicans are ahead or they are likely to win\nIf Democrats are ahead by more than five or six points\nUh they're likely to win so there'll be looking at those early returns and then from there on out what there'll be looking at is I'm as the secretary of state continues to report usually I'm the report is a heavily weighted by the big counties those initial reports so the Democrat as always ahead\nA and if a Republican wins they win as the smaller and medium sized county reports\nUh in two thousand and sixteen Trump was behind in the first for secretary of state reports and then in the secretary's day report which was about nine o'clock or he started to catch up and then six report which was about nine Fifteen nine twenty he went ahead and in state of had the rest of the night", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "30"}
