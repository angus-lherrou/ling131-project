conducted with candidates in major races and Ohio today two of the candidates for governor in a bit we'll hear from libertarian Travis are dying now we continue our conversation with Republican Mike DeWine\nMoving back to the issue of opioids which you essentially addressed as the top issue\nAt the beginning of this conversation you mentioned you have a a multi prong approach to that\nYour critics suggested as attorney general you did too little too late to deal with the opioid crisis specifically not filing suit early enough against major manufacturers last year you did and sewing drug distributors only this year how do you respond to that\nGrow up there's a real contrast between what I did and what Richard Cordray did you know he was the attorney general prior to me a ... test\nOver twelve thousand rape kits that were sitting around police departments all the states but he didn't do anything in regard to the the drug crisis that we're seeing that they took office we started moving on this we took the licenses of over a hundred doctors who are nothing more than drug dealers\nOr you know we closed down the film in which\nWe have been very very aggressive in regard to this or we have ... we started something in our office that you don't normally associate with the attorney general on that as\nA we have people who are community community outreach people who are working in every community in the state to try to share with them ideas that they that we have seen other communities exercise in regard to prevention as well as treatment and\nAs well as in the area of of law enforcement so we we've gone after the Mexican drug cartels and but if you look at our plan\nA or twelve point plant and I would ask our listeners viewers to take a look at that Mike DeWine dot com take a look at our twelve point plan in regard to drugs you'll see some very holistic planned out a lot of emphasis on drug courts I'm I'm grateful\nYou talk to the people of the recovering addicts who have been drug court many times what they will tell you is\nThe only reason I'm Alive today as I got I got picked up thrown in jail and I've got this judge judge so and so who was willing to give me a break and say look if you get into treatment um you know and successfully complete treatment you know you won't have to go to jail what they will tell you is tough love works\nAnd the the results when you talk in these judges is phenomenally high result\nUm and so these are things that we need need to do more of and that's in part of our our twelve twelve point plan\nDoes that play into your thinking behind your opposition to issue won the neighborhood safety drug treatment and rehabilitation amendment which is aimed at reducing sentencing for nonviolent\nOffenders little boy I sure does um you know state issue one sounds great when you first look at but when you you feel a way that the layers and look at what's really going to do is just it's a disaster there's a real difference there's a real choice between Richard Cordray and Mike DeWine in regard to this his fourth I'm against it\nThe point you just brought up about drug court CEO would decimate drug court because what it will say is that anyone who is caught with drugs in their possession doesn't matter how much drugs they have let's take fat and all you could have enough ... to kill twenty thousand people you could be caught with that\nAnd under the provisions that will would go into the Ohio constitution this issue one is is in fact ratified and passed by the voters this November\nYou could not charge that person with a felony that person would be charged with a misdemeanor and\nThe first time they were charged for doing this there could be no jail the second time they were charged that they got caught again there could be no jail at all so what that means is that the push to get someone that pushes someone into a drug court simply will not exist anymore and our drug courts\nGo into treatment because they're forced into treatment because a judge told them to do that the ... the Senate thing it will do\nLet's take a human traffic and let's say that human traffickers been caught in been sentenced and everybody the victim and everyone says okay he's going for X number of years surprise under this this particular plan or is it is approved by the voters\nBy merely going to a program in prison that person can start peeling off their sentence up to one quarter they could take let's say the guy was sense for ten years to take two and a half years off\nAnd I I think when we look at these people that that's going to be happening to human traffickers for example we shouldn't cut them any breaks\nProponents of this issue one might disagree with your back will disagree with you and essentially say this will help and not\nJailing people really need treatment or you don't see it as accomplishing not in any way\nNo I think it's going to hurt people there's going to her treatment wildlife treatment um the we all believe I think that someone who is an addict we want to get them treatment and so that might have wanted ministries will have more treatment might want him and his regime will have more drug court\nBut the only way many times that we have found for some people to get treatment is if they have to do it and it's just it's just the way it is I talked yesterday to a recovering addict\nOr she did the press conference with me yesterday and she said look you know this this got made into a treatment or this has helped me that won't happen anymore if there's the issue fast\nTalk about expanded Medicaid because it also relates to the war on opioids a Republican such as governor case it can senator Portman has said that the expanded Medicaid\nI'm I'm In favor of the expansion of Medicaid but I think we can improve so\nAbsolutely I mean that's the battle we've been fighting all year of course we had to fight a an even larger battle for ballot access in the first place you know into doesn't Thirteen or fourteen the Republicans in the state legislature threw a curve ball at the Libertarian Party in particular because we had a tuna toil candidate named Charlie are all very popular with the Tea Party is a former state rap\nAnd what they did was they redefined minor party ballot access I'm basically saying that minor party has to get three percent and the governor's race or presidential race to maintain ballot access for four years\nUm that's a tall order already even taller when they then at the Republican spent six hundred thousand dollars just to kick Charlie ... off the ballot on a technicality that had never been enforced before\nSo the Libertarian Party of Ohio has not been a a recognize minor political party for four years we had to raise a over two hundred thousand dollars of thousands of hours of volunteer work to get a hundred and two thousand six years just to get back on the ballot\nThat was all certified at the beginning of July uh my candidacy wasn't certified until the beginning of August so yes we have had much shorter time to even get our name out there and get our party recognized out there\nBut I Will say it's been very encouraging since we've been back on the ballot and since I go out and speak and all of our ideas which you know I feel a libertarian ideas are winning ideas\nAs soon as people here who we are and know that we exist they're very interested in that is very encouraging\nLet's talk about this idea to talk about some issues here on even many Republicans such as John Kades like Rob Portman the expanded Medicaid has been one of the state's best weapons in the battle against the opioid epidemic you've called the whole thing case of care you agree on that one point in before we move forward it's at least helped their\nI Would say considering the opioid crisis is is when the worst it's been especially last year I I Would definitely disagree with that statement I'm I disagree with the way John Case of ... with Medicaid expansion or he you serve to the state legislature there's plenty of ...\nOver the line and this is why they didn't like case it to begin with and and I don't want people to think that conservatives and libertarians are monsters saying that you know poor people shouldn't have healthcare it's the fact that government run health care is the most expensive and least efficient way of doing it\nUm seven hundred thousand Ohio's on health insurance that sounds like a good number right for a politician you you'd think oh I Want seven hundred thousand votes\nSo they go out and and you know the wind flip flopped on this issue he was\nVaguely against it during the primary when he ran against married Taylor and then when fall for Medicaid expansion by July [noise]\nUm so again what I've put forward is not just a rollback of Medicaid expansion you know we don't want to just leave these people hanging right away\nBut a roll back over to two to four year period of time and what I wanted to do is basically break open the healthcare market or the free market provide the free market options to to health care and what that means is essentially\nYou know we have laws in this country they're written by the insurance companies are written by the pharmaceutical companies and that's what keeps these things are growing in prices every year um you know the millennial\nObamacare we oh I'm a landslide of the great idea well\nGuess what millennials who bought in their premiums went up every single month and they don't go to the doctor so now they're just paying money for insurance that they don't need I personally was a conscientious objector I paid the fee the individual mandate fee for not having health insurance for many years thankfully I agree with\nTrump on that that are that they repealed that part of Obamacare but what I wanted to do is for Ohio to be able to buy health insurance across state lines you know that's a free market solution that also brings down prices I agree with that Jared poll is a Democrat running for\nGovernor of Colorado as well as Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders there in a CNN town hall last year agreeing on this issue that Americans should be able to buy a pharmaceutical drugs from Canada and other countries where again the prices are much cheaper you'd love to do that\nYeah that's what's encouraging for me it was all actually work with is Republican legislature better than Mike DeWine and John Case it was a kid that's how I feel about it because they see a lot of areas where we agree hum a lot of Republicans\nI'm their tax and spend Republicans but there's a lot of fiscally conservative Republicans when the within the state legislature as well I've often said that when it comes to the line item veto power of the governor when I get my hands on the budget I'm going to need more pens there's still so many pork projects packed into this budget\nUm for example blue asked did he counts them in a visit Mary Taylor supporter\nOr who was in I I think is considering the leaf\nOr he pointed out a a an item that in the budget that was a four million dollar um to a soccer stadium in Cincinnati for the the new MLS team first of all I'm a Columbus Crew fan so save the crew still have that fight to go through ... and you know actually support Mike DeWine with what he's doing on that\nBut you know when it comes to this for a million dollars for a soccer stadium tucked in there that's going to fail in front of the voters eight times out of ten right but someone had to deal with the Republicans in the state legislature and they and they talked it in there so\nYou know I Want to work with fiscally conservative Republicans in the state legislature I Want to work with them on rolling back the Medicaid again there's a lot of them still opposed to it I also want to work with a lot of them on on keeping gun rights basically protecting the second amendment\nOn that scenario again where you find case that can Mike DeWine want more gun control um and certainly I feel Libertarian Party candidates are much more likely to protect the second amendment than rhinos you're talking about supporting additional limits on on gun rights where are you there\nUm I don't support any more limits or or or any other kinds of gun control I think we have plenty already I think we have\nMore law abiding gun owners in Ohio it's a multi billion dollar industry when you look at not just the arms industry but I'm hunting and things like that so there's no reason to put more restrictions and regulations on people who are all\nYour plant 'em well as a small business owner myself I'm you know the main thing we can do right now is jobs Ohio not transparent I think they should be susceptible to an audit\nAnd we need to see what kind of things they're doing it in there and if they're not being efficient than we need to cut the department I feel um I Know the wind chills that's another great part of the case if legacy but you know what they've been focused on his bringing in companies than what I've seen as a millennial entrepreneur myself\nIs that millennials are trying to start their own small businesses are a lot of them are getting better and better but as they grow the government wants a little bit more and more I've talked to a small business owners who have spent tens of thousands of dollars on regulations in red tape alone so we need to start allowing these people to innovate and we need to deregulate I'm not just\nBeing able to grow a small business but but these industries that are trying to come to Ohio and we keep ... over regulating even are gambling industry is over regulated radar micro brewery Michael distillery industries are still over regulate it breeds of China pop up a lot more now because they deregulated them enough\nBut even things like vape starts food trucks hum I've also spoken about the medical marijuana industry which was supposed to take off you know on September eighth and it's been hindered by the Republicans\nAre on the pharmacy board and in the state house on this is a multi billion dollar industry that can help us fight the opioid crisis it's just such a no brainer to legalize marijuana beyond medicinal\nI I Do yes I think it should be legalized recreational in Ohio I think it's just a matter of time for a millennial in my lifetime that it will be legalized all over the United states but for now it's a state by state issue you have nine states who fully legalize as well as the the district of Columbia\nAnd um you know the fact Ohio's falling behind the way we have just in our medical program I mean it were the laughing stock of of the national movement on\nLet's stay with business a lot of attention being paid to minimum wage certainly because of the Amazon announcement earlier in the month would you like to see Ohio stay around the eight dollar mark or do we need to raise it over the Fifteen or ...\nAll a minimum wage so I'm not an issue I Am really going to take on just because as a freelance and small business person entrepreneur I've worked for way less than that sometimes I've worked for way more than that it's a per project basis for me\nSo I really want to see Ohioans I'm essentially going to work for what they want to work\nOne of the big issues of courses issue one on the ballot or you've called an imperfect I Believe but step in the right direction would you accelerate that yes I Would a criminal justice reform as a big part not just the platform but also in terms of\nFighting the opioid crisis again um again I feel too if I Do if you're a crisis I'm Mike DeWine at the whole point plan I have a to point plan ... medical marijuana and prepare for eventually full legal marijuana and then use those revenues to invest in treatment of\nDrug addicts and anyone who needed I mean um we have too many a non violent drug offenders in Ohio's prisons already we spent over five hundred million dollars a year\nOr just on incarcerating these people and they're not harmful they just made a bad choice and so I agree with issue one in terms of reforming how we ... and you see a lot of people coming out in favor of issue one there are people who work in the corrections facilities you know they are wardens within the prisons\nAnd so these are the people who say a lot of these folks should not be in here um I I Am absolutely in favor of issue one I don't think it's perfect I think it needs to you know to be perfected probably you know with more laws in the state legislature\nBut um I think it's a step in the right direction and I as governor would go even further and others also throughout I'm against the death penalty if you want to save taxpayer dollars are not killing people for the death penalty or again that's a no brainer for me", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "15"}
