contract to follow yes\nHe has ... after a year and a half is contract was up with Fox and they gave him credit is\nNamed earlier any ethic and they had to copyright and and\nUh and so I his interest in the show so does he live when CBS did not on the I Love Lucy theme song is actually owned by a Paul McCartney\nHow how did he get owned by Paul McCartney is he bought a music library and that was that was part of it but he was nice enough to let us use it for the share of its permission to use yeah she is the yeah and then ... and the lyricist\nOn the other half a because they were lyrics for

it the so it sounds like it's Wilbur Hatch conducting the does your nose orchestra and so that's what you hurt and I thought it was pretty authentic sounding\nGreg this is not the first time that you and I have worked together in two thousand we produced a version of my favorite has been at the museum of television and radio in Beverly Hills\nAnd we also got a taste of my favorite has been in tonight's play and learn all about how it and it involves the radio show evolved into I Love Lucy um how did\nThat original radio show with Lucy and Richard scanning come to be\nIt was actually Harry acronyms idea uh and and uh he had written a book called the Mr Mrs who got nothing to do with a a good cook either a ... coup that [noise]\nHe wanted to make a a comedy series out of it was it was a sort of a society show a about a bank vice president a socialite wife\nAnd a and he he's a you know so he talked listening to doing it actually didn't have to do much talking she wanted the job so much that does on a sharp turn sharp went to Hubble Robin ... Lucille do it for nothing that she wanted to she wanted to be on radio and uh\nIt it it started with somebody else playing a husband but he had other commitments and then Richard downing took over\nAnd then when my dad came on board as I said he changed the character of a no longer a socialite shoes now a little girl on the ground woman's body who was always scheming and I want to actually\nPointed Lucille Ball half I mean how I mean when she was she was doing movies but was she doing leaves early she playing secondary roles are where we she at in her career when the radio show came along\nShe did a lot of B movies as she was on the movie you know I think we need to be she was on some some measure when we started with Henry Fonda\nA and I'm Catherine Hepburn and a a very successful but she she wasn't really a leading lady and she was approaching forty so it was it was getting a little late for her to to make a big splash so that's why the reason she wanted to be in radio show also thought should be able to spend more time with Desi\nSo this this show really was of of you know about their marriage and and they you know she she wanted to have a family and she she was willing to give up all that just to to be with us\nAnd how long did the radio was the radio show on the air before they decided to go into television while they turned it around\nStarted ...
