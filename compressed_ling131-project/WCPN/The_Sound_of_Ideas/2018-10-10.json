I Believe you counted a hundred examples of violence in Congress between Eighteen thirty in Eighteen sixty can you tell us about one or two you found particularly vivid oh sure\n... and it ended up being about Seventy I was trying to be very strenuous about what I counted as a fight and I suppose I should say by fighting in Congress I actually mean physical fighting so as you suggested people pulling guns and knives people shutting each other people punching each other\nMass brawls a dual challenges gaining you name it it's happening in some way or another\nThere was a major fist fight involving a number of people right and then the only guy wild when somebody snatched up someone's wig yeah exactly exactly and that's a that's a fascinating\nIncident now that's a late what then happens in Eighteen fifty eight but what's fascinating about it is a lot of the violence that I talk about in the book is usually one man versus another man very often a southerner provoking a northerner or or try to intimidate a northerner but in Eighteen fifty eight is we're creeping up towards the civil war\nI'm really talking about a house divided by by that point you really have southerners and northerners are to say they are at odds that drastic understatement and so\nDuring an evening session and Eighteen fifty eight there is a a northern kind of an aggressive northern Republican\nFrom Pennsylvania names for the wonderful nineteenth century named pollution grow a and he objects to something all standing amidst a bunch of southern Democrats and a south Carolinians name Lawrence kits\nObjects to the fact that grows dares say something objecting to something a southerner says oh he's storms over to him and\nThey act over there with your friends and when gross says I don't have to listen to any slave drivers like you get ... gestures as though he's going to punch grow and gross slams kit and knocks him flat\nAnd at that moment\nStreams of southerners come pouring across the house some of them probably to break things up more of them probably to join in\nAnd when the Republicans see that their ally is being surrounded by warring southerners they begin streaming over to the same spot jumping over tables and chairs to get their with their fists clenched\nI Do I also do not think we're on the brink of civil war but I think there are moments and all of those moments of Seventy nine easy Eighteen fifties the Nineteen sixties\nMoments when Americans understand\nThis some kind of a shift happening in the climate the political cultural and social climate and it just raises the stakes of politics\nAnd makes it very hard I think people feel that if they don't give their all and do whatever it takes to get what they want that they're going to fundamentally lose the battle for all time\nIf you look at the Seventeen nineties their politicians explicitly saying look I Know what the rules are but to hell with the rules right now because if we follow the rules they're going to win so for the safety of the republic for the survival of the nation\nWe have to break rules and that kind of a climate and logic again clearly there's [laughter] hauntingly familiar aspects of it to what we're experiencing now\nBecause what you're saying is that when people went into politics in those times and perhaps now in the press and what they think is happening is a fight over the soul of the country itself right\nThose moments precisely which is not to say that there aren't other fraud moments and that there aren't other moments of enormous change but I Do think you know the slavery struggle the civil rights struggle of the Nineteen sixties the question in the late Seventy nine is about precisely how democratic nation the nation would be\nUm all of those things are are sort of peak moments of decision and I think we're experiencing one of those moments\nNineties there which look very much ... and also a reminder that we lived through all those times\nExactly well exactly and that's you know so we lived through them all and after you know in a sense you could say that those moments are kind of debate and not very pleasant kind of debate but we do live through them and that there are decisions made\nAnd there are positive as well as negative repercussions to those kinds of moments sometimes\nFor change to happen you have\nTo go through that kind of a you know what I Want to call it like a crisis like almost like a let's say cleansing moment but there has to be an extreme moment to open the door to change\nAnd I have to say on that note precisely I think we should end this interview and thank you very much for being here and giving us some hope for the future nice to have you here Joanne see so much for having me Joanne

politics and power I'm headed Cox Richardson\nAt I'm Neil Conan polarization is hardly limited to the United states in Eighteen sixty or in twenty Eighteen it's been a major factor in the politics of many countries and we may have lessons to learn from outside examples where our own passions aren't so deeply engaged\nJennifer McCoy is a scholar polarization she leads an International Research group on polarized democracies she's a distinguished university professor at Georgia State University She was a mediator and the Venezuelan political conflict from two thousand and two the two thousand and four\nAnd she joins us from the studios of public radio station W. A. B. E. welcome hello and\nThank you very much for the invitation Venezuela is tearing itself apart a freely elected government has become increasingly authoritarian an economy based on one of the world's greatest reserves of oil is in tatters hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are now refugees\nCan you walk us through how polarization contributed to this crisis yes Venezuela went through\nSevere economic crisis in the Nineteen nineties with hyperinflation and tripling poverty rates and so that people rejected the political parties and felt like they were responsible that they had mismanaged things and had not\nDone things to to redress debt crisis and that they were corrupt themselves so they were open to an outsider candidates the of ... who came ... ...\nAnd spending your money and we need to change things up and renew our democracy and redistribute the oil wealth to the poor so many in the country bought that he was elected but he came in with the very transformative agenda and\nHe used a confrontational and very polarizing strategy to try to accomplish the change that he wanted to accomplish\nAnd as he did that he created a backlash they would have dueling massive protests in the street and in one of those shots were fired a number of people were killed in the military blame Chavez and removed him in a coup\nA which only lasted two days and he was brought back when his people came out into the street in the military change their mind and brought him back\nSo the confrontation came I think from the need for change from people suffering from that economic crisis and feeling like their political leaders were not paying attention to them\nWell you've written that when one party starts to dig in and refuses to compromise and games the system it's really crucial that the other side doesn't do the same thing that it should continue to play by the rules but in the example of Venezuela but you just given us the government is packed the courts and figured out ways to exclude the opposition from Congress\nIf the opposition tries to play by the rules doesn't that just give the government license to run roughshod\nCertainly it does now but in the beginning the opposition had a chance and particularly after that\nCoup when things had blown up and the last patients basically and went through a non democratic maneuver to remove him which was a military coup d'etat\nWhen that didn't work and he came back they had a chance to negotiate basic changes in the rules in who would be appointed to the courts and that kind of thing but instead they ...\nKind of existential fight to eliminate the other rather than walking back and trying to work together again and overtime this\nPolitical fight got infused into the society said that the citizens themselves became just as divided in fact neighborhoods families were divided\nCaracas itself you would go to one area of town and the restaurants were only for the people who were you know anti shop as you go to another area of town and that was only for pro shop is people\nAnd people would be tackled and harassed if they tried to cross over so overtime yes the opposition lost those battles in trying to remove schottische Chavez consolidated his power and excluded them to carry it out and it became more and more authoritarian said that they fight very well\nA democratically through elections by the time you get up to the present day\n... of course as should start things have gotten no better in fact probably worse under his yes successor Nicolas Maduro but let's step back a bit when you're talking about polarization the you seem to describe because not just political exchange to society in general\nYes exactly and that's when it becomes more and more difficult to result you know one way to define polarization is just\nDifferences and they growing distance in political leaders political parties beliefs in attitudes on specific issues if it's just that it's possible you know to look for compromises and to negotiate or for people to choose okay we're going to like this party now and go in this direction and\nOh we don't like that next time around will elect a different party go in a different direction\nWhen it gets to this more emotional level what we call aspect of polarization because it involves feelings an aspect that's when we get into tribalism\nThe other party and all the supporters of that other party or that candidate\nHave given more thought too\nWe'll applies those skills to practical problems as the author of the ethicist column for the New York times his books include cosmopolitan ...\nThe honor code how moral revolutions happen and most recently the lies that bind rethinking identity Kwame Anthony Appiah joins us from his office at NYU it's great to talk with you again it's very good to talk to nail\nIn a world of ever more tribal identities your book looks at five factors creed country color class and culture five factories we use to define ourselves and that others use to define us\nOn examination none of these turns out to be simple all of them are based on mistakes and myth is your own store your identity and example of the contradictions within and among what is supposed to be bright line definitions\nYes I mean I suppose one reason I thought about this so much fun for so long is because\nI'm you know my mother was English my father was gone and I live in the United states I come from a particular as everybody does from particular class background and so on and all of these things mean that when I meet people for the first time very often that Saudi puzzled by\nBy what I might be [laughter] since since I'm sort of brown skinned and many people the guy looked like an Indian but I don't talk very much like an Indian and um they don't sound like the guys see I told me they say is I was raised to do like to see 'em and in fact my my mother\nWho is no longer alive I I've watched some video of her the other day and I realize that the person my mother most sounds like a is the English queens she at a very very particular kind of English accent\nWhen we see each other categories that you talk about for identity are vastly over simplify but why do you think they became such power\nWell I think because we're we're sort of programmed to thinking these essentially tribal clannish times because\nAnd to deal with the fact that human beings lived in small groups which are competing with one another and we needed a psychology that would made the groups held together so that they could compete it's very easy to town on vanishing is and human beings and so that's one reason and then once it's turned on\nIt takes a look to turn it off so that's why that's so persistent I think\nThat's a a big problem\nAnd I think there are solutions to it was one of which is obviously that unfortunately people have more than one identity and so sometimes we can use one identity to undo the the bad effects of another\nAh for example by the differences in their views about lots of political questions and in many ways I think people's fiscal views\nAre generated by the sense that well this is the view of my tribe rather than by thinking well what do I actually think about is the vast majority of people\nBut I Do not think that as it were all the ... should be permitted and the vast majority will also think that many should be and the disagreement is about the boundaries but the party's represent essentially the basic either too extreme views the\nThan Democrats currently hold them as where there should be no limitations a total and emotions and the Republicans hold them as many as possible inside let's try and change the interpretation that constitution to make possible more\nSo I think that there are many cases where the the parties are a very very sort of divided in these hostile way is generated by the sense of tribal identity and if we can get away from those\nIdentities for the moment and think of ourselves for example all as Americans which is another identity or we might be able to to do more with them\nArgued that just by you know exposing ourselves to different kinds of people we increase the likelihood of understanding this is the idea you called cosmopolitan as him but when we look at the map of the United states in red and blue urban and rural or we see that uh people\nLucian yes well I think that is a great difficulty there has been a kind of sorting and and people used to live more in in both in the country and in the city people used to live more in communities where there was a regular interaction I live in New York City there's lots of Republicans in New York City\nBut um I don't find that I meet a love [laughter]\nI think that's because ah in the current moment with all these tensions people try to avoid politics a lot of the time so even if I Am leading Republicans are neither of us is going to bring politics up because there are more cheerful topics of the moment\nBut partly I think it's because you know social circles are increasingly divided along these lines and that means as you say that the the mechanism of\nForming links and friendships across these divides\nWhich which is just to spend time together doing things um\nYou know working together to run the league's going to church together and synagogue and temple and so on all those things if we don't have those then there's this mechanism which allows people of different identities to get along\nOr doesn't get out for us to have so it would be good to persuade more people of the buses to go through there because the hatred is a good thing and it might help loosen people's attachments to these things\nWhich are very often you know bad for our society not every moment of racial identification is bad of course I'm\nA racial identification brings people to black churches were wonderful things happen I don't mean to say that every elements of\nRacial identification is bad but I think again it's one of these things where if we could just remember that we're yes we're black and white and the other one brown and so on but we're also we're all Americans are all New Yorkers or whatever it is um that would help and loosening the attachment to the racial identities\nBy saying to people you know this isn't actually as deep as we've been inclined to think might help when you talk about this\nIs I Wonder if our emphasis on race stands and that the shorthand today for politics because race has been Langford cell by the right end by the laugh in terms of identifying their tribe is that a realistic or a fair way to look at the question\nClearly there is a connection between our political drivers of an racial tribalism\nFor reasons that I think possibly intelligible the vast majority of people who identify as black\nAre now going to vote for the Democratic bodies far as I can tell for the foreseeable future unless the Republican body changes and a similarly there are now increasingly people tend to stress the the sort of working class components of the of the white Republican vote but I think that's a bit misleading there are people of all classes who identifies white who\nUm think of the Democratic party I think as having\nTo put it to its most extreme gone to war against white people for seeing white people every day to confess to um crimes or to taking advantage of privileges to where I Wish I was in titled racial privilege and so on and so they feel but as it were backed into a quarter and so they\nThey think of themselves as unable to support the Democratic buddy even if they agree with with many of its policies um on other topics so I think\nYes there is a connection between race and our political tribalism and it's producing again the system a situation where identity\nTrumps actual politics policy at Trump's people's thinking about well what do I want to do do I want to have an effective universal healthcare system\nUh well if it turns out that your tribe is against the current system then you'll be against it even if if you were able to stand back from your tribal identity you might say well actually this is a pretty good thing\nAnd the same is true I think you know among could think of things that the Democratic try\nIt's called and they respectively should be to the role of business plays in our society in generating the wealth which we can then ... to build a social welfare system and the health care system and the and the public institutions of our society so I'm\nThe drivers and just gets in the way of uh in these contacts of thinking through to the issues there are better ways of thinking about the about trade than that and there are better ways of thinking about how we should think about Russia than just attending to whether the president likes the Russian leader\nBut because of the ... that's how these things end up uh working out\nWe're talking with Kwame Anthony Appiah a professor of philosophy of law at New York University His new book is the lies that bind rethinking identity and let me raise another of your categories\nCountry the idea of what you've called cosmopolitan as we've talked about before where many people define themselves as citizens of the world well it seems to be in retreat in many places not least in this country nationalism is on the rise and not just nationalism but nativism\nAnd isn't this one of those other areas where these identities intertwined isn't this directly tied to race\nYes I think that there's always been a strand of American nationalism that was tied to racial identity I don't know whether we can show that the numbers if you increase but we certainly have seen a rise in the visibility of a form of American nationalism that's a racially defined and that means it's anti Semitic as well as anti black and that it has residences with\nThe ideologies of the national socialist in Germany the Nineteen

means that there'll always be housing available for people that meet the definition of long term or a you know homelessness in our community so that means that if you're homeless for up to one year have a mental health\nA diagnosis or an addiction or have been homeless I forget the exact put four times in the last three years the fever going one\nA one year and total that you would have you'd be prioritize to get into a housing first building right and that they would eliminate many barriers where you get there\nThe problem with that is that you know you have to be homeless for a year and um and I think that you know there's a lot of people that don't you know if that means you have to be living in a shelter for one year or you have to be living outside in the street for one year and that's\nThat's you know I think as a community we want people to to move out of shelter faster than that and I think you know there's other programs that we have that's part of housing first that\nEquates to that but I think one of the things that you know we need to recognize is that a housing first policy in Cuyahoga County as for single adults right and so great one way we don't have ... all of our permanent housing buildings are\nAre are you know one bedroom apartments are efficiencies and they're not do so we don't have a housing first policy that houses families in our community\nAnd and that's an issue a lot of what you know people you deal with Margaret our our families were talking about family homelessness\nNo I'm Single and then that we do work with family homelessness we do have a pre school serving about Seventy percent of the families and our preschool are actively homeless today we'll go we'll go home to one of three\nHomeless shelters I'm In Cleveland and you know family homelessness is what is growing rapidly but there is beginning to have their it'd be the beginnings of some energy and some conversation\nHomelessness would be would would it exists but that it's rare and brief that your time homeless would be rare and brief\nAnd that is the vision or for for functional zero and it's something you know that we when we look at veterans' homelessness here in Cuyahoga County we have really been able to\nCome to that functional zero and there are systems in place um to ... currently supporting and sustaining functional zero for veterans homelessness ... family so lead for families you know let's let's let's get this thing roll it it is going to take the community\nBeing outraged being engaged being\nI'm wanting to dive into this very complex issue that involves\nAlcohol substance partner violence housing issues race a mental health um employment\nI'm a generational I'm as stumbling blocks um it it's a it's a very deep complex issue and so we're going to need lots of threads in order to create this fabric\nChris I popped into the Greenland before we started and told you that I was surprised to hear this number twenty five percent of an increase in family homelessness which was a staff that I had and you said oh no it's actually thirty something percent so can you tell me what what number we're talking about and why and where the where you think that comes from\nYeah so I think uh you know we don't have the data totally for this year but where we do know is that there's been a large increase in the amount of families that are coming into homeless services to seek\nTo seek support year this year you know substantially greater than than previous years and I think it really looks like it means that all of our family shelters are full every night great and\nOur community that wants to guarantee access to shelters every night if you're homeless on the streets\nYou would wonder how that happens when you see an unemployment rate for example that's the lowest it's been in years so when you equate those two things and you say unemployment is down and housing first is is being pushed in all of these initiatives are happening and yet we're seeing a rise in\nFamily homelessness what what do we what do we pin that on in ... in the show us that we are doing something\nYou know when you look at it plain that we have got to look at minimum wage\nI think we as to why did we see and we worked hard to get our minimum to Fifteen dollars an hour but that's not true Walmart [laughter] rent WC a Wal Mart we can go down the list of companies um who are not paying a livable wage\nSo you cannot equate employment\nWith being able to sustain\nA livable wage for individual or a family you cannot do that on eight dollars and ten cents in Cleveland Press which has an affordable right quote unquote affordable cost for who for whom\nAnd I think are bringing it back a little bit I think one of the ... and I think a a living wage is one thing affordable housing\nIs is definitely something and I think to recognize we're community that has decided to opt pick people up when they fall apart right we are not a community that we don't have a lot of dollars in homeless prevention right so there's you know if you're\nYou know close to getting addicted if you're you know you're recognizing you're missing some month's rent a and you're not going to be able to make up that money there's very few places in our community where you can go to get help and so I really think ah we need to as a community have a conversation around how what is our homeless prevention are having\nAnd ask you a question of our panelists or let us know what's on your mind we'll start with Mansfield in the hospital [laughter] hello there Mansfield\nMorning how are you might as well very good thanks for taking the call I was wondering if any of your panel ever hear of Camelot did or did you ever know about Camelot you did you ever hear ...\nYeah ... we are now the police station is right\nExactly yeah that was a lot of the loan was the old ... bakery\nAnd the people are taking it over and they lived there and it was and I had a high school friend invited me in and they lived there peacefully there are some people who just want to be left alone as much as possible and sometimes the sorority we had trouble doing that I think\nSo um yeah so have you heard of that now this Camelot was on an abandoned building in an area where where people had lived in Cleveland what does that St Clair um and uh so what about the idea that some people just want to be left alone Chris you talked about going under the bridges you're not bringing them out of under the bridges are bringing services to them [noise]\nYeah I think uh you know for lots of reasons people have you know have one ... isolate themselves and and I think legitimately could want want to be left alone I think you know and being really self sustaining and finding really creative ways to survive\nYou know and that sounds like a you know what happened a Camelot is not on similar to you know the the ten or twelve young adults are living on the west side you know living in an abandoned building and taking it over and living there for the town city an acronym for the tent city in Akron I\nThink I'm\nOne of and that we\nI think one of the things we saw in the communities last winter we had three people die when it gets cold right and so this winter were preparing we're talking about safety plans were talking about you know how to get people to stay warm at night because I think there are people that\nWe need to make sure that our outreach workers in our community or going out there and and checking on them you know being like do you have woods so they keep you warm than that we know it's going to be negative ten you know this weekend are you prepared for that if not we can get you into a safe place for the night\nLonger and was just a little bit too long\nSo ... and you were were were were were missionaries there together yes we're you're both first one's yes we are okay or it and um and it gets kind of the work that you were you specifically that you always plan to do missionary work or how did you end up going down there [noise]\nWell um that's a good question I Would say probably you get a vocation to be a missionary just as you get his location to be a religious person and [noise]\nUm I think I'd probably always wanted to be a missionary and I think Dorothy did too and uh she had done a little stint with uh some Indians are in the southern United States and uh it it just gets in your blood a little that don't you think\nWell my my stories a little bit similar but different\nI was a student in Rome and off for my deacon here I was a day to day can send to Africa by the bishop at the time there and a A R R bishop ... and uh I went to a military for a missionary experience that I came back on fire I was a mystery about God and to me you're giving yourself to these people\nTo do with the church has asked us to do and\nWe received so warm\nOut is what I say they give back so much easier than we give\nThat's I think Cleveland has been so blessed\nBecause we gave a Clevelanders haven't given over fifty three years now the U.S has supported the mission and but we you know the few of us that have gone and along with all the other organizations that have supported submissions but\nI think we've all come back so much more enriched and that's where ... you know group has become so\nValuable helping with the orphans and the children down there and the school\nSo it's free marriage of the conversations your head of what all of a of the core peace mission core stands for the community of ... Romero okay they picked his middle initial spell a word and it was the oldest\nDoctors had already been doing their yes ... Romero was installed as archbishop and Nineteen Seventy seven which system or the remembers and that really is when the killings escalated and in some ways the war started there was a coup in the government and\nThe army was really moving out into the countryside and then the guerrillas were counterattack into the army that left all these refugees that the religious in the Cleveland mission team we're taking care of one of the priest and who has since passed away father Ken Myers was in one of the refugee camps and it had been building\nThe idea that there were these children in the camps who didn't have any adults separated from their parents or their parents murdered very sick\nNeeded some extra care and so father Ken was the first one to take a couple of children back to his parish and Sarah goes a little town outside the capital\nAnd work it out to the north American priest would take children and they started organizing to bring hundreds to go so over the next few months okay and that's still where you're where are you still work yes not my story out of the transition I think I Am a good example of a transition between with the Cleveland team did\nIn the sixties and seventies to now I was a freshman in Nineteen Seventy four and ... in high school [laughter] yes [laughter] where where sister Dorothy had just left to go down to the mission and I'll Salvador so we had to do about it but where I school students so we're not paying a lot of attention\nAnd then uh and after one year of college I wanted to leave and do one of those years of service that are now so popular but nobody was doing\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine and they asked serious ones if I could go down and just hope up on the mission and they told me no it was too dangerous by Nineteen Seventy nine so I found something else to do went back to college and discovered on the front page of the New York times that sister Dorothy had been murdered December second Nineteen eighty\nSo along with three other troops were how long we want from William ... Donovan right um and I would have been working with gene Donovan gene had worked out in the mission\nI went off and had a career as a chemist computer programmer came back to Cleveland in in Nineteen Ninety nine and one of the earth ... who I visited through the nineties down in El Salvador said why don't you joined the board of car now I visited El Salvador we'd gone up every night for tea with the nuns and the children of color and I said what is the board of car\nShe said all that fundraising all that support comes out of Cleveland so I joined and my role is\nReally fundraising and awareness raising that I Do go down three or four times a year but we have seven thousand active donors around the United states there are a couple of high schools who ... who have gone down to a physical or\nParishes that go down to visit and so it's really incorporated thousands of northeast Ohioans into El Salvador and one way or another and it spread out far beyond color and into parishes blood fair says go on their own\nAnd how many how many ... do you just if if the focus on children decision what does it work as a war\nThey had about four hundred truly orphans children through the eighties by about Nineteen the war ended there was a ceasefire and Ninety and then ended in Ninety two and a the sisters who are running color then brought the population down to about a hundred and fifty or a hundred and foster care what we would recognize as foster care\nAnd that's gone on for the last for the Twenty years now that populations closer to fifty they're much needed here than they were during the war years but the school has gone up to a thousand students pre kindergarten through twelfth grade\nAnd so we support about a third of the school okay through scholarships\nHow what is your view sort of uh if if we look to Sunday when our Oscar Romero was going to be canonized in ... in Rome how would you sort of how would you describe piece wider see both within the church in general but particularly for that the church in El Salvador and here in Cleveland\nWant to start with ... with your sister\nHis legacy I Would say\nAs we get a really a\nUm\nWe resent them a little bit I don't know what other word to use [noise] but uh you know that hierarchy is a a distasteful word to use but when you have a man so filled with God's spirit who then uses that\nPower he has to speak for the people I I can see where we have a need to have\nThe church be a presence in that form in that way [noise]\nUh and so that's a a legacy for me personally it has always made me be grateful that we had someone of that caliber the church bishop ...\nAnd you know he was really\nHe he was a hero and when he was he was only archbishop for a couple of years but um she had the people in the palm of his hand he would he would preach on Sundays and they said you could just walk through the streets and everybody had little transistor radio or listening to a Sunday harmless coming out of the ...\nAnd at the same time he was the voice of hope and there was the voice of truth as a voice that gave the people the possibility that um you know\nEvil haven't totally ... over the country\nExperienced that myself I'm just tell this one little terrier and what's funny story but\nWhen he was gone out of the country for a few weeks to the Pueblo conference or one of the bishops conference as\nI myself were was aching inside to hear him and see him again\nAnd there was a mass where he was returning to the to the cathedral I climb up on the bench in the casino role and towered over all of the ... so that I could get a glimpse of him at the back when the procession entered that's the power he\nPretty cool record we have it all that kind of let her Curtis says if they killed me I Will rise and the Salvadoran people they have his spirit\nAnd you were there for an eighty eight to nine to five who he was area was after the fact that eight years afterwards\nAnd you could everybody knew everybody loved him he had lost any of his charisma he was in the hearts of those people I remember is funding we political rallies and everything we're taking place and one of the authors of um ... the author of Romero's death was running for ah of up\nI think there's parts of it I'm not even sure at this point little old lady she was going to be bigger and this was there and I said what what's going on and she says\nHe kills senior and killed a senior and then when that guy got a got throat cancer and he ended up um people say see\nGod doesn't forget it gets back at it was it with people they held him such high esteem\nThat was Joe for all are talking with a number of locals about Oscar Romero will be canonized on Sunday we're gonna take a quick break right here we come
