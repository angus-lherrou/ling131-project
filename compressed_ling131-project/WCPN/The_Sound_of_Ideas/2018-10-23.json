there are many forms of populism Donald Trump has his form of populism rhetoric but his populism as right wing white nationalist populism he chooses to divide\nUsing race religion immigration status and gender progressive populism unified and brings us all together\nThe late Senator Paul Wellstone used to say we all do better when we all do better\nWe also have to talk about the power of systems

Democratic Party is going to do it's going to be up to activists\nAnd voters out across the country and they're making it loud and clear they want the Democratic party to challenge the status quo and to fight for the Ninety nine percent not the one percent\n[noise] three broke his heart was the Democratic party and here to make his\nStatement against the motion please welcome Steven Rattner

reprehensible levels and must be addressed I Believe that the federal government should lean in and try to solve the pressing problems of those who have been left behind\nBut I don't believe that endorsing policy ideas that are either unaffordable\nWould somehow be good politics for the Democratic party there has not been a single Democratic president elected in our history espousing the kinds of policies that the proponents of this motion advocate not FDR ran in Nineteen thirty two on a platform of balancing the budget not John F. Kennedy who by the way cut taxes for the rich\nCertainly not Bill Clinton and not even Brock Obama who Senator Sanders attack this week for not pushing more progressive policies then there are other losers George McGovern who carry just one state and the district of Columbia in Nineteen Seventy two in Nineteen eighty four Walter Mondale suffered exactly the same\nFate all of us up here agree that the election of Donald Trump was one of the saddest days of our lifestyle [noise]\nWithin\nAn approval rating hovering around forty three percent there's no way he should be reelected but if we want to make the unimaginable imaginable just nominate someone out of touch with the mainstream of this country\nRemember that only thirty three percent of Americans are even Democrats at all the share of independence that thirty seven percent is the highest and twenty seven years\nYou've heard the suggestion that Bernie Sanders could have eaten Donald Trump will never know\nBut we do know a few things the fact that democratic voters are increasingly concentrated geographically particularly in the blue states like New York and California so to when we must reach out to more moderate voters in Pennsylvania in Michigan and in Wisconsin three states that we never should have lost\nYou've heard turnout blamed for Secretary Clinton's loss but it's sixty point one percent turnout was higher and two thousand and sixteen than it was for Brock Obama's reelection\nPlus on the order of six hundred and eighty billion dollars annually expand Social Security that sounds pretty good until Americans understand that the trust fund is on practical broken twenty thirty four and jeopardize the benefits that we've already promised make public colleges tuition for is just suggest that it's a great goal for the under privileged\nBut if any of my kids were to go to Republicans too should I have no idea why they should get a free ride break up the big banks that sounds appealing although apparently not Mr Sanders Senate colleagues\nNone of whom have signed on as co sponsors of his bill\nAbolish ice only thirty two percent of voters want that wall fifty three percent understand that immigration and customs service albeit with reforms is something that we need to have\nI share the goals of the populace but we should address the critical issues facing our nation by putting forward responsible prudent policies that will attract the coalition of voters that we need to keep Donald Trump from another four years of destroying America thank you\nThank you Steven Rattner round one of us\nWe live on the ground to and in round two the debaters address one another directly and they take questions from me and from you our live audience here in New York City\nWhat we seem to be hearing about is a dispute over how many voters will respond to the set of policies that are identified with progressive populism\nThe team arguing for the resolution ... and Jeff Weaver they described in this country a sense of emergency in light of things like seeing a phobia and ultra nationalism and racism\nA tension between top and bottom and then in that framework they say these are solutions\nThat appeal to the bottom ideas like Medicaid for all free public college tuition abolishing ice housing as a human rights the team arguing against the resolution Jonathan talent and Steven Rattner\nThey identified themselves as progress those but they said the problem is political reality these ideas will scare the public that\nTo either vote for these things they voted against or when put in place they ultimately failed and I want to take a question to Jeff Weaver from something that your opponent said in that Democrats need to have moderates come into the tent and it almost sounded as though they were saying that you and green are arguing for appealing to the Democratic base\nAnd that the moderates you just can't get them I Want to see if I understand that correctly that\nIs not what we're saying we had a hard fought Democratic primary between Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and the evidence was pretty clear I've seen a zillion polls in a zillion states Bernie Sanders was winning\nRural Democrats conservative Democrats moderate Democrats\nSecretary Clinton was doing much better with suburban Democrats who on paper looked liberal because they are ... pro choice support that ended a little warming and so on and so forth so the modeling that was done is clearly showed that Bernie was winning the very voters that you're talking about in red places\nThere were coming out overwhelmingly for Bernie Sanders which is why you want to recall might want to Kansas he wanted to ask anyone in Utah when in Idaho and on and on it goes and in fact it is these voters that I'm arguing we need to bring back into the working class voters in red states\nThis question about geographic concentration democratic support is a very very serious problem that we have an electoral college system when we need to broaden our support geographically\nAnd the way you do that is by being unapologetically on the side of working people in these states we all forget the in\nThe mid west of this country used to be the center of progressive politics in this country the plane of ... we have lost touch with those people because the truth of the matter is that there are many people in that wing of the party really don't like those people very much\nOkay just let me break into let your opponents respond to some what you said is it a lot of ... and Jeff is saying that those voters and the red states that you say it would be driven away by these ideas would not be driven away\nWell let me address that but first let me just the last comment you made and maybe I misunderstood it but if you're saying that I Do not like a bunch of working class voters that beyond offensive\nDebate is not whether we feel or you feel more passionately about helping the struggling in working middle class of this country question is is not whether people like your ideas whether those ideas will win elections and they don't\nWas debating this resolution we'll progressive populism saves the Democratic party now it's time for questions from the audience\nA point of fact here it is true that twenty sixteen twenty twelve the voter turnout was around the same however and twenty sixteen it was significantly down among people of color and among working people\nHillary Clinton was a centrist than was ah from the wall street wing of the party and her numbers suffered and what you're really saying is had there been a populist maybe Bernie Sanders in right out of Hillary Clinton would we be with President Trump today I think that's your question yes a ticket to what\nWe saw in twenty sixteen with Hillary Clinton and people of color is that they were not inspired to vote for her the issues weren't there they weren't talking to them and another thing that was happening around that time and twenty Fifteen\nWas the black lives matter movement right the crime bill came up and so there was a lot of feeling from particular young black voters who didn't feel that\nUh the campaign was talking to them who didn't feel that there was a place for them because of what was happening in twenty Fifteen with young black bodies being killed on the streets let me take your point to a\nTo John ... I think you have to disentangle\nProblems with Hillary as a candidate from the question tonight if a candidate in the future\nCarries these ideas will that candidate when whenever you think of the merits of these ideas they're not politically popular enough places Jeff cited the senators who might run for president who support Medicare for all that is true\nThey're all from state blue places our job as a party is not to figure out how to make blue places bluer it's how to make red places blue and purple places blue that's our job [noise] have\nHave not gotten a fair shot in his party in terms of funding other things but what we do know is that your point of view\nHere it's going to kill this party you guys represent a certain group of interest I get it at school like this is a big tent party but you cannot be the dominant voice in his party because you have no credibility with working people when you went and talked to real\nPeople in the real world we have no credibility with working\nPeople so just to be clear because you and Bernie and said this many times you sit Brock Obama wasn't progressive so widely supported by working class people were rock Obama built an amazing coalition in fact I think our challenge is to rebuild the Obama coalition the centrist Obama coalition just to be clear because that's actually\nWhen we have to do look I don't know what I Would have had you make a point of known as something ...\nObama didn't support any of your policies virtually he didn't support Medicare for all hidden support free college tuition\nFor ... years ago were talking about two thousand eight things have changed since ... because he can you also point out All right\nAll right time and I want to throw something into this conversation that comes from an interesting direction the other day there was an op ed attacking Medicare for all it was written by Donald Trump got in\nTrouble and he said quote the truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead and Joe Biden reacted to that still Trump is should hang up so does Trump's characterization of the party have any traction drunk out saying\nThat because his greatest fear is running against someone like Bill Clinton or a bomb and that's why he thinks he'll lose if Democrats regain the house a third of the Democrats in the house will be self described new Democrats\nFar from the centrist democratic wing of the party being yet it's alive it's well it's real busted selected the last two Democrats\nTo the White House and I don't believe the way to win is a reprise of Nineteen nineties democratic centuries them any more than I Believe a reprise of Nineteen sixty democratic socialism the way to win we're in a new era and we need some\nSo it to respond to go back to a question it's not just Medicare for all there is also debt free college there's affordable homeownership or you talked about examples of elections recently where candidates have one\nUm Conor Lamb Pennsylvania Eighteen congressional district a very red district I think it had been held by Republican for more than ten years if I if I get that right he was running on protecting Social Security he was running on protecting Medicare and Medicaid\nThe issues matter as well now where do you guys stand on that word is third way stand on Social Security I think that matters because you're talking about that are issues are not going to win the day but where are you guys on Social Security\nI'm protecting Social Security isn't just Sanders position or progressive populist position it's a position I Can't really think of many Democrats who don't\nHold it there's a woman with black sweater and I go out to the U.S thank you\nI'm my name is Cathy I'm Wondering you mentioned the new deal and the marginal tax rate in order to pay for that program went from twenty five percent up to Ninety four percent and most other countries that have\nYou know Medicare type for all its Seventy percent how will you get normal working people to be willing to pay Seventy percent increase in taxes in order to pay for others\nYou know there's a recent study out at a Medicare for all his also point out that over half of a democratic members of the house of representatives sport Medicare for all the postmaster legislations for Medicare for all who's not a fringe idea by the way a there was this report would show that in fact aggregate health care spending in this country would go down substantially if you had a Medicare for all system so will people be paying more taxes\nYes no doubt about that you can't get around that\nPay less than premiums yes cars won't pay premiums they won't pay any ... there'll ... we're going to finally be able to get our hands around the pharmaceutical industry was ripping off this country in charge against the highest price of the world so in the aggregate our country is going to save money is going to be good for business\nIf you go to half of Americans and say you're going to give up your employer based health insurance and come on a government plan they would think that was a great idea\nBut I Want to make a a slightly different point 'cause question was really about taxes Clinton was elected in Nineteen Ninety two why didn't lose the house in Nineteen Ninety four because Bill Clinton raised taxes and the people did not want that so there is a limit to I'm for tax increases I said that um opening remarks you can raise my taxes or whatever you want it but I think it has been well proven in this country\nThat there's a limited tolerance for raising taxes beyond a certain point and I don't think it works politically okay I Want to go to some more questions thinks\nHigh there remains Jen I'm I have a question for each side um I mean there's always and party fighting but there seems to be a claim of who is a true Democratic Party and I guess that are like okay\nWhat's your view is representing the Democratic party type [noise] know can I answer that are so young when I asked if there is a little spray parties\nThing you're supposed to do is build a winning coalition that does not just include your side or other people the point is if you want to get the White House back\nIn large Chastain democratic majorities do good things for the working and middle class of this country you have to build a winning coalition that's the map will they build a winning coalition and when you look at it they don't actually do that ...\nHave such a problem with that because what we're asking for is inclusive witty what we're saying is if you reach out yes\nWhite working class in the middle America absolutely matters no one is saying we don't talk to them were saying like hey there are brown people there are black people there are young people that needs to be reached out to it needs to be inclusive\nAnd that's how you build a winning coalition and it needs to be multiracial and so for decades now those folks that I just mentioned have felt left\nOut we have we have felt left out and now we're at a point\nEveryone you have to have in coop city you have to include everyone and we can't go back and just focus on one group can\nThere's your quick response to that I agree a hundred percent that you have to have a diverse coalition and there's a lot of folks who haven't been represented well and spoken for well the question is what ideas should those diverse group of candidates Terry and build those ideas and able to get a win\nSir my name is Paul so for people who are skeptical\nAbout too many government programs and being dependent on\nGovernment health care and government funded education and fearing losing their independence and freedom of choice someone who is more moderate like me who has left the Democratic party become an independent because I don't particularly relate with a lot of these ideas how do you win me back what a great question\n[laughter] that's right on the table so I'm going to have you for free tuition\nAnd public colleges and universities we already have\nK. through twelve I think we're all support probably going down to pre K I don't know if you guys are in that camp or not so we have an arbitrary deadline where where did you get past twelfth grade now we cut you off we didn't use to by the way in New York state in California oh the places you didn't use to get cut off and twelfth grade\n... doesn't want his kids getting a free ride but if this kid's shows up in first grade he's going to get a free ride that's just the way we work at in this country we have\nUniversal secondary primary an early education there's no reason why we can't have it for undergraduate school or even graduate school our European allies in many cases do do it that way\nA great loss of talented young people who either choose not to go to school or come out of school greatly indebted and there's research that shows that people have so much that that they delayed making major purchases like getting married having kids and whole host of other things\nIf we're going to compete in the international environment we have got to have the best trained workforce in the country we got to maximize the

N. dot org\nOr tweet at sound of ideas and were posting all of the candidate interviews by race and Idea Stream dot org slash election twenty Eighteen\nEach of the auditor candidates spoke with Idea Stream managing producer Joe ... who asked them to begin by answering the most basic of questions why are you as a person for the job we begin with favors answer\nWell as the Ohio society it was a CPA said would they endorsed me my background and experience is ... had prepared me to hit the ground running on day one it's that ability to think critically in my background and experience both as a mediator now for twenty three years\nAnd as a lawyer who's handle complex financial matters coupled with my experience in the state legislature asking hard questions of state agencies that's really part and parcel with the auditors office does and that experience has prepared me to hit the ground running on day one okay\nOf answered part of this but basically why are you interested in this stuff I mean you get your your background is a lawyer and a legislator and this is a you know this is your you'd be looking at a at at the operation to state and local governments why why why that might tired legislative career has\nOf the things that make state government and local governments be more efficient more effective\nAnd frankly more transparent all of those things are what I've done as a legislator it's really culminated in the state auditors office it's the one place in state government that you can go up particularly with the use of performance audits to find ways to make government work better for ... the Buckeye now\nIf you observe or what your immediate predecessors Mary Taylor Dave Yost have done in the ... what do you think they've done well maybe not so well what do you like to continue and what would you like to change\nUm I I think for the most part they've all done a pretty good job on Dave has done a really good job catching people who are lying stealing and cheating and holding them accountable\nLook I Am proud of the work I did with Nina Turner and and frankly rows and Tom Sawyer to draft the current model for redistricting reform that the voters put in the constitution for state legislative districts\nThat constitutional provision such a real clear track record that requires bipartisan adoption of maps and that requires things like ... and keeping local governments together and drawing districts those rules are pretty clearly laid out in the constitution and I'm a strong advocate have been all my career strictly following the constitution\nNow I'm the similar provision were adopted about a year in may this year um and for the congressional districts now the process to get to those rules is very complex you start out in the legislature and then you go to the redistricting commission and then you go back to the legislature if you can't get agreement\nIn that process I think is way too complex but again voters approved it\nI think you follow those rules that are laid out very very carefully and you do them with a measure of keeping districts compact keeping people able to be represented by people who share their values now remember both of them require bipartisan support for tenure maps and I think that's an important component as well\nHow do you think the reforms when we look districts in twenty twenty two and the impact after that how's that going to change the legislature 'cause there's a lot of people who believe that the way we've done it and both parties have played the game of gerrymandering if there is to emphasize partisan differences as opposed to looking for bipartisan solutions are", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "23"}
