C. P. N. dot org tweet at sound of ideas and were posting all the candidates interviews as the air and Idea Stream dot org slash election twenty Eighteen\nThat's where you can now find governor secretary of state and US Senate candidate interviews\nThe attorney general candidates talked with ideas dreams managing producer of community affairs Joe ... and he began by asking the most basic question for a candidate why are you the person for the job we begin this morning with federal back censor\nSystem that we have right now in Columbus has fundamentally broken a there are donors who get what they want while the needs of the people of Ohio are overlooked and what the people of all how should be looking for somebody with the experience and also the independence\nOr to have their backs to be a good attorney general and that's what I have I spent my career as a prosecutor\nA I have ... cases against Republicans and Democrats alike when they thought they broke the rules against big companies against the pharmaceutical companies are against banks whatever when I thought that they they were not following the law\nBig cases a and I found the hard cases you know you know you you saw me in this community people saw me here uh\nI wasn't afraid to take on heart issues I wasn't afraid to take on cases even when they were in particular are probably a lot of a Christmas on holiday list on crossed off in the city of Cleveland for the things we did but that's a job at the attorney general to the right thing by the people of Ohio\nAnd Dave Yost uh my competitor respectfully is part of the problem is a career politician who's been in state have square a\nWork in a in a system that has fundamentally broken he's a lookout for his donors when his uh when it's been in his interest to do so we let the cuts scandal or take over the state of Ohio diverted a hundred or two hundred million dollars from our kids that's not what Ohio needs Ohio need somebody down there is independent in tough\nAnd then last a a huge part of the settlement should be making sure that we're taking whatever money comes out of it and funneling it to treatment we should use this to have the pharmaceutical companies\nHelp pay to treat people who have become addicted to opioids\nUp because of the products that they made money off I say this is somebody who's worked in the treatment community I was a recovery resources public servant of the year I was the Adams board public servant of the year but very proud of those recognitions\nBut they'll tell you that the continuum of care that we have right now for people who are addicted to opioids is is not what it would be for any other medical condition it's almost like we we bring people in let's say that they had cancer\nAnd we bring them in and we have surgery and we take out whatever growth or tumor that they have and then in the way out of the hospital we just hand them a piece of paper and we say\nHey there's this thing out there it's called chemotherapy and it's called the radiation and maybe you should check into it we don't know if you need it or not but good luck you're on your own of course we would never accept that right but we do accept that for people who are suffering from a addiction\nAnd we need to reform that system make a comprehensive and funded\nHow are you planning to vote on state issue one uh so uh I plan to vote\nMany people talk about this uh the goal is a state issue one are actually laudable goal right now our criminal code or in Ohio is outdated or too often we actually incarcerate people for nothing more than being addicts or in addition we don't spend nearly enough money on treatment we were just talking about that\nAh but I personally believe uh that the place for those kinds of reforms and changes it's not in the Ohio constitution we've gotten a bad happened in the state or a habit of putting things in the constitution when our leaders failed to act on them and our leaders have failed\nOur state legislature our governor our auditor our attorney general Dave Yost Mike DeWine John Case like the legislature down there has been asleep at the switch\nAnd it is their fault that Ohio leads the nation and the opioid epidemic the opioid epidemic isn't their fault but the fact that we're the worst that certainly is and they have abject we failed to look ahead and to try to come up with creative solutions to resolve this problem\nUm that's fair but what's not the right thing to do in reaction to that is to put the drug code inside the Ohio constitution\nLike look like many Democrats have criticized the auditors day if you start your opponent this race for being too slow to recognize the reporting problems that he taught I sat quite the critic [laughter] criticized for taking money from he caught in a while they were stealing from the state\nBut he would maintain that the only way we reason we know about the cops deficiencies is because of the work that you know here's department of your auditor did um\nHow do you respond to that and are you are you assessing his role perhaps with partisan blind\nNo I'm not and the way I respond to that is it's just ridiculous uh it's it's the response of somebody who so used to one party government who so used to nobody even questioning anything he says that he thinks he can get away with saying that the sky is red when it's really blew look at the facts here they're\nPretty simple and undisputed number\nOne\nFor at least a hundred and eighty six million dollars which has gone they took it they didn't just your number to Dave Yossi auditor of the state when this occurred this isn't over ... scandal she's the auditor he's supposed to be checking the records\nNumber three he gave them clean audit after clean audit after clean on it\nWhile they were doing this number four while he was auditing them she took tens of thousands of dollars in cash\nCampaign contributions from each one of the biggest recipients ... why do you think are just hypothetically what do you think that the guys who were stealing want it to give the auditor all this money ... and I don't think it's that complicated you know what do you think we would say if you know Jimmy Maura\nHad said oh yeah I took thirty thousand dollars from these guys who stole from the county but I didn't I couldn't caught him\nWe laugh at it and then number five day just who's now gotten religion because he's in an election with somebody who's going to call them hot\nRight and he said uh oh well I couldn't have done anything and uh and and I thought I had some misgivings about it but uh but you know I don't think I could do well then why in the heck is our auditor your auditor\nThe graduation speaker at the ... commencement ceremony three separate years while they're doing this why is your auditor taking out the ... with them and keeping these e type guy she auditors award with distinction\nFor financial recordkeeping while they're doing this\nKnow if they feel responsible I knew there was something going on I just didn't have the tools to catch a number one he shouldn't be the attorney general cause of the attorney general this day isn't smart enough to figure out how to catch somebody who's stealing a hundred and six million bucks they need a new job and number two\nKill us response and no those are the eyes of a prosecutor not a partisan\nThe notion that you can take money from somebody at the same time as you were investigating them is just absolutely outrageous hey by the way\nHe has given the money away right and so for years later while he's in an election he held this press conference said he was going to give the money away well you know that's not the point the point is they already bought\nThe favorable treatment known giving the money away now doesn't fix the fact that twelve thousand Ohio families are out of luck because they didn't have a school to go to because he missed the ball\nYou know we so we were taught you caught a there's the federal investigation or the activity is the former house speaker clip frozen burger presumably about his ties to payday lending industry\nI'm over the years we can all come up with additional examples of public corruption or in Columbus round the state obviously here in Cairo recounting what ... you know what's the role of the attorney general's office and investigating and prosecuting these cases or\nWhatever role it is it has to apply equally to everybody right you can't have\nA situation like you have with Dave Yost where he he's in the wind out all of a sudden they're just unable to find their jurisdiction\nRight and do anything about these thieves who gave them all this money to their campaign but\nYou know when it comes to investigating a a local homicide case in in pike county\nMike DeWine gets his windbreaker and goes down there like he's the county prosecutor when it comes to running around Cuyahoga County in busting Internet cafes you know Mike DeWine more than happy to be front and center in front of the cameras when it comes to go into Steubenville\nAnd doing a ... a rape case involving the football team there Mike the winds dancing in the end zone in front of all the cameras are you know are the same rules have to apply to everybody\nOr the rule the attorney general is to lead on issues of ethics and corruption\nOf the government but step one is you know you got to treat everybody the same and the attorney general has to be the leader in terms of making that real for people for\nDecades we've seen periodic stories in the media detailing the often significant political contributions made by attorneys in law firms that subsequently ended up getting independent counsel work from the attorney general they helped elect\nAre you concerned about the perception that political paybacks are going on and given the reality is you'll be you will be hiring independent counsel if he were elected how are you going to insulate the or the office against those perceptions\nSo of course as somebody who is a career prosecutor who is running for office for the first time let me just say it's not just this question\nI think anybody who looks at the entire campaign finance system and doesn't have some concern you know really needs to look again so what you do is you try to set up a system that tries to ensure as best we can that people understand that work is being given out to people who understand how to do the work well for the people of Ohio\nYou know but this is part of a broader problem I mean endorsed candidate of and Citizens United right I'm going to have millions of dollars in dark money from the Koch brothers coming in to Ohio to smear me I get that there's a campaign finance problem in this state and in this country\nThe best I can say is I had the experience and the track record of standing up and doing hard cases in holding people accountable\nRight I Can't tell you that on day one I'm going to change the United states campaign finance system I can't tell you that the first thing you did to his pick people who are tough in independent and can't be bought to do these jobs and that's\nI have Twenty one years of experience as federal prosecutor that says I'm that guy\n... thank you very much for joining a ...\nRight to take a quick break right now and when we come back Republican ... makes his case for Ohio attorney general this was the sound of ideas\nYeah but you see pie in data work you can also join us on Facebook and Twitter We're at the sound of ideas you can also check out our Web site and Idea Stream dot org slash ideas now you're listening to the sound of ideas on Ninety three ...\nAll of which the da says is responsible for eighty percent of all addiction cases okay how do you um how do you plan to vote and how are you urging Ohio's a vote on the issue one\nIssue one is a terrible deal for Ohio as I just mentioned to you I don't think addiction and be a felony offense you shouldn't go to prison because you're a heroin addict or an opiate addicts but at the same time this would open the doors are and goes way too far\nNineteen grams of fat and all which is enough to cause an overdose in ten thousand people or forty nine a unit doses of heroin I'm would become a misdemeanor with mandatory probation\nIf you've got forty nine unit doses of heroin that's not personal use you are either a drug dealer and we just didn't catch you selling it or you're a mural for a drug dealer carrying this stuff\nOr what you are not as just an addict because if you were an addict you'd be dead the thing that addicts do is they keep taking the drugs they have and if you had forty nine unit doses a and on an addict\nThey're just going to overdose\nWould you be more inclined to support or consider a substantive issue one if it were a legislative initiative as opposed to a a constitutional amendment where you have to go back to basically even to change the commerce subsection\nWell as I said I think we ought to move away from an enforcement paradigm to a treatment paradigm with an enforcement component to motivate ah as far as addiction is concerned\nUm that being said issue one even if it was a statute goes way too far\nI'm the benefit of what the statute as a general assembly could come back and dial it back but there was nobody has\nUm but going up to almost fifty is unreasonable and I am not willing to go there in ...\nOhio was one of many states as well as local governments that are suing a drug makers and distributors for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic is a state right to be part of this litigation and your mind what should a a settlement or resolution to the case look like [noise]\nWell Ohio was absolutely right to have brought this suit um\nProcess or the lawsuit will do discovery and we'll see what degree of a evidence can support the\nClaims in the lawsuit of the lawsuits about deception active deception about whether are hard to what degree are these dangerous drugs were addictive so we're right to be in court as far as what a settlement looks like\nA I think that remains to be seen through the progress of the case but I Am a priority needs to be that these resources are available to help clean up the problems that they created and that means prevention and that means treatment\nAs attorney general will you fight to make sure that that any money that comes from a from a settlement to on the hour the opioids case\nIndeed is used for for treatment or other things very much directed to that one of the critiques of the tobacco settlement\nWith that Ohio and other states ended up treating the money as as just another pot of money and didn't use it for some of the state of smoking cessation or the alternative help farmers find alternatives for their land that that really people invasion when the when the settlement was announced\nYes and I was unhappy when I saw the original terms the settlement may unilaterally changed um or diverted I should say I actually have a plan on how to structure is is that uh I think will make it\nIt's an auditor um were you too slow to recognize the reporting problems that are at e caught the electronic classroom it's tomorrow in and how do you respond to critics who say that you and other Republicans including attorney general DeWine relate to this issue because of political ties to the school founder Mr lawyer\nThat's absolutely untrue in fact most of what we know about you cut today comes either directly or indirectly from my officers work\nWe began all when I was only in a office for a couple of years we began pressing hard to look at the reporting in attendance issues around surrounding the entire charter school movement I use my officers in ways that no prior other auditor had\nI used the information I gained from that push for changes in the legislature which ultimately resulted in the strongest reform bill we've ever had in the charter school area and that in\nTurn led to OD\nA changing their standards remembered there the regulator not the auditors state um and ... been controlled by Republicans and Democrats a tenth strictly wasn't a didn't use his power that the Supreme Court said he had a to do anything either\nBut I did and uh I'm very proud of the work we've done and will stand behind it\nWe just mentioned in Congress say there's there's a federal investigation into the activities of former house speaker cliff Rosen burger presumably about his ties to the payday lending industry you know over the years we all come up with additional cases of public corruption\nIn Columbus and around the state what's the proper role of the attorney general's office and investigating and prosecuting these cases should you'll be the lead agency on this or should you be working hand injunction with with local prosecutors or the federal government where does the word in the eighties\nSixty five convictions that have a\nRisen from my work in the auditors office um\nAnd I intend to continue that as the attorney general now that being said our statutes in Ohio don't give the attorney general leave authority or over these cases and I think maybe they should um\nThat's conversation we need to have with the prosecuting Attorneys Association and a a law enforcement and the general assembly um but I think that there's a room to have discussion about\nHow that ought to work\nFor decades we've we've seen periodic stories in the media you may have even written some when you were at the citizens journal um detailing the often significant political contributions made by attorneys in law firms that then ended up getting independent counsel work from the attorney general they helped elect it seems that doesn't matter if it's Democrats or Republicans we we see these stores\nAre you concerned about the perception that political paybacks are going on and given the reality that you'll be hiring independent counsel if if you were in the ... how would you insulate the office against that perception so first of all\nLet me say I've had to raise money I've been in politics for a little while now and run a couple of times and nobody has a right to expect anything when they\nContribute to Dave ... other than good government I make that very clear I've never done favors friday one and I'm not about to start\nWith regards to the ... a special counsel uh one of the first things I Will do when I come in is to do a top to bottom review of the process is for evaluating here's here's the goal here is the consideration in wording those contracts what is the value for the people of Ohio\nCertainly continuity certainly expertise or certainly cost I'm the one thing that should endeavor\nWe don't even have a list of ... in the office nobody knows a who has given to me or not ah I prohibited I don't allow politics and the office that I won't do it I won't allow it in the office of the attorney general either\nOkay ... thanks very much for joining us to do\nNext Joe interesting piece on five thirty eight dot com right now about attorney general races
