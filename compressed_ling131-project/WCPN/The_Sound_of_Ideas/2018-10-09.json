these and more have led to the erosion of trust in our political institutions\nWe've come to the point where many of us could no longer agree on the fact where science has become politicized and conspiracy can outlay consensus\nIs our democracy and risk if we step back at that and look at the scope of American history\nWe've confronted such challenges before over the next six episodes the democracy test will look at some of these critical moments to see how our democracy survived an adapted examined lessons learned see how some of the crises we face today can be traced to the past and\nI don't think about some possible solutions\nAnd we've listed a guide to help us follow the course of these challenges Heather cops Richardson joins me to co host of the democracy test she's a professor of American history at Boston College has written books on reconstruction on the history of the Republican Party and other wars against the planes Indians\nYou may also know her as co hosted the podcast freak out and carry on a title that saved more relevant everyday thanks for coming along on the democracy test either oh it's great to be\nMuch greater weight than events in the past even in the recent past amid all of the alarms about the crisis of American democracy today do you think we forget about the crises of the past\nWell you know it does seem to me when I listen to the news that political observers seem to think that the world started yesterday and here's the news flash it really didn't if you think about American democracy it's sort of been in crisis almost since the beginning you know baked into our DNA we have the issue of race which has been with us since then and it's still with us today\nThan we had that problem with expansion across the nation you know we went from the Atlantic to the Pacific and then beyond\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century we had the civil war which seemed like it was going to end the American experiment once and for all as Lincoln said\nThat we were testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived could long indoor and then we went straight into industrialization and that created the extremes of wealth and poverty that seemed like it would tear the Democratic experiment into\nAnd then the twentieth century we had two world wars world wars that made it seem like we're going to end western civilization as well as the American nation and at the end of the second of those world wars we had the advent of the nuclear weapon which had\nPeople like me hiding under our desks back in the Nineteen sixties so the concept that we have somehow had a peaceful go of it until now is really\nA misnomer it's really not the way American democracy has ever happened in in each of those crises we felt at the time that we might not lived through them but we did Americans came together and looked at the problems they had and found ways to get through them and to recreate American democracy so that it was still strong\nAnd may be stronger than ever at the end of those crises\nWell that's the thesis of this series that we've seen these problems before and figured her way out but does that risk overlooking a unique figure Donald Trump\nFor sure President Trump is unique and yes\nAnd at the time people thought we couldn't survive them it's only in retrospect that we look back and say oh yeah the solution to that was obvious at the time it wasn't and people had to work their way through it so Trump is different yes\nHe is a crisis in many ways to American democracy yes but he's no more of a crisis than we have gone through before\nYou know the first episode is titled why democracy and then a few minutes we're going to be talking with class assistant political philosopher Danielle Allen about how the examples of Athens and Rome guiding the framers of our constitution\nOur government and from what it's worth\nWe have some pretty fine figures who have stood on that ground and I made a point to you know crazy people like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and\nDwight Eisenhower and Lyndon Baines Johnson people who believed in the American experiment and in American democracy and who governs very differently but who believed in that concept and that we need to maintain in order to maintain the health of our democracy\nWe're going to pause to have a few of these conversations from time to time on this series but for most of the democracy test Heather and I will be asking questions of our guests coming up Daniel Allen who's written extensively about the history of political thought at fly democracy stay with us\n\nSo now we get down to it why did Athens choose democracy why Romer republic and why did the group of Americans choose to revive a form of government that have been largely ignored for almost two thousand years\nOne of the major differences between the ancient models in the U.S constitution and does democracy mandate a trade off between equality and liberty\nAnswers to those in many other questions we turn to clash assistant political scientist Danielle Allen the James Bryant ... university professor that's Cohn and with the tea and director of the Edmond J Safr a Center for ethics at Harvard she's the author of among others why Plato wrote the world is ...\nAnd just from her office at Harvard welcome to the program thanks so much for having me and let's begin with the basic question in fact the question that's the title of this episode why democracy\nHuman beings love liberty we all know that and that love of liberty is a desire to shape our own lives to shape the direction and our choices\nWere those impulses you just described where they behind the decision of the Athenians to adopt democracy well\nThe impulses I just described are human decision or human impulses rather I think in all honesty that you can see them underneath all kinds of human political decisions yes they played a role in ancient Athens the story of ancient Athens is really one that begins with conflict between the rich and the poor\nAnd with the judicious decision of a man named sol on to begin to shape institutions in ways that permitted both rich and poor the chance to develop shared directions for the city\nWell is it fair to say then Danielle but with all the other kinds of governments that there were in the city states in ancient Greece hit the monarchies the tyranny is the oligarchy is of all the various types that Athens was successful because it adopted a form of democracy\nDemocracy definitely brought it special success\nThe secret that Athens had was that they organize their institutions to really mixed the different parts of the population up\nSo they use their political institutions to bring urban Athenians rural Athenians and if he needs on the coast to gather\n'em in slightly sort of randomized ways to make decisions what this did was turned Athens into an incredible knowledge generating machine you can think of it has and that meant they were incredibly innovative they developed a powerful economy it gave them military power\nIt also meant that if ... from all walks of life could reasonably expect to play a leadership role in their political system\nDoes the agenda setting body pretty assembly that crafted all the political decisions for the city so it wasn't about passive citizenship was very much about having an active role in shaping the direction of the city\nJust how radical an idea was this was something that would inspire fear and the other city state just because they feared the model of democracy\nWell it was definitely something that shook up the Greek world and over time there were lots of democracies in Greece so there are thousands of city states and incredible historical work at this point and has sketched out the different have different cities took to things like democracy but other cities hung on to oligarchy which was ruled by the rich and other cities hung on to monarchies\nSo that was absolutely a contest about which kind of a political form brought in the most well being to its population\nBy the measures that we all pay attention to economic prosperity growth the capacity to adapt to a crises or outside shocks and so forth by all of those kinds of measures Athens was by far the most successful city state and the Greek world\nWell some would argue that that's access was built on the backs of Athens slaves and it's women who had no political or economic right how do we square that with this you know suppose moral superiority of democracy\nSo the big question that people ask the Athens initial guard is the fact that over time and established an empire and which other cities were paying tribute to it\nAnd that financial revenue certainly contributed to the strength of the city and indeed was you know sort of the benefits of that were raped by those who are poor members of society who could serve in the military and were paid on the basis of that tribute\nSo there's a real question about the relationship between Athens imperial basis and its success there are other examples of sort of colonial forms in antiquity that didn't share some of the other great features of Athens of for example Athens had this incredible flourishing of literature and philosophy and drama and art and there was a sentence\nCertainly contributed to Athens A power and force but not to the distinctive things that said Athens apart from other political systems\nIn other words the women didn't have any rights and then the other city states either and they were also slave owners as\nWell but yes I mean basically everybody was a slave owning society women had writes in Sparta actually so in fact the spartan um all of our tax system was one that put women in power so\nThe facts that Athens did not had a patriarchal system was distinctive of democracy and that is something that we have to recognize that the history of democracy that in lifting up a poorer citizens with democracies have tended to do and this was true in the American case as well as to make the household the unit of membership\nSo rather thing that you know the membership is or the the rich property owner might be a male or female the unit becomes the household\nAnd then the head of household namely the poor man is the person who's given the membership rights so that was true in the American founding as well and in fact I Would say one of the\nImportant challenges at the Nineteen and twenty a century has been for us both intellectually and institutionally to re conceptualize the basic value of democracy delivers by way of liberty and equality such that the basic member as the individual not the household\nThere's an extraordinary moment in a scene in history and the second Persian invasion when domestically convinces the Athenians to abandon their city and their farms they would be looted and burned by the Persians and the unions retreated to an island and put their feet into the hands\nOf they're vastly outnumbered fleet that sleep properly crushed the Persians in the battle of Saddam is am I wrong to attribute that kind of Brazilians and courage to democracy\nThat moment rested on a prior moment which I think as to the heart of what the democracy success was about the reason Athens had the incredible naval fleet it did was because some years earlier when they had discovered a brand new silver mine in the city\nMoney to everybody in the city or should they hold the revenue centrally and build a navy\nThat was the first big moment of communal action about domestic please persuaded the Athenians into he convince them that they would be better together working to build a shared instrument the navy and just popping up all the money and distributing it out individually so they did have an ethos that was about\nA commitment to community a commitment to protecting their democracy and working on that together and not ethos also they behind the success of telling us\nSo this is fascinating about how democracy affected Athens but as far as Americans are concerned wasn't Rome much more of a model for the framers\nRome was much more of a model for the fame or is in fact they generally were critical of Athens so Athens was a direct democracy any male or female and citizen could show up at the assembly that means in theory you could have thirty to forty thousand people they're voting on a political issue typically they probably had about six thousand people that are voting on a political issue\nAnd that direct democracy was turbulent and there's no question about it sometimes from Accra see chose extraction and then you know David I Choose wider action and from the point of view of the American founders they were interested in a somewhat more steady and stable form\nThey look to Rome for that because they thought roamed it ultimately a better job of balancing the interest of the\nSort of educated elites of the wealth it leaves and the ordinary citizens so they were interested in the sort of representative institutions that road more fully developed\nAnd what were those why did run look so much better to somebody like James Madison well\nRome had a Senate ah which in some sense represented that older more traditional both serve wealthy and highly educated elite and then it also had the clubs the ordinary people who are represented through Tribune's and so the point is that they welded together\nTradition and culture and things like that and so that in some sense lies behind the design of the Senate and the house of representatives and the American Congress that said the American founders took the idea of representation for much further than the Romans did so what they really deserve credit for is inventing the idea of a representative democracy\nFifty give us your questions will get answers this election Idea Stream was

performing arts\nThis is the democracy tasks from truth politics and power I'm headed Cox Richardson\nAnd I'm Neal Conan our guest is Daniel Allen who joined us from Harvard University where she's the James Brian ... university professor and director of the Edmond J Schaffer Center for ethics we previously mentioned your books on ancient Greece and the declaration of independence she also wrote\nTalking to strangers anxieties of citizenship since brown v board of education\nAnd Daniel and that book you talk a lot about the culture of democracy in particular or something you called civic friendship can you tell us what you mean by that\nAt the end of the day that successful democracy depends on the ability of citizens to generate trust amongst themselves\nThat is they have to prove themselves trustworthy to each other and develop resilient bases for interacting and fighting and debating and testing and dissenting and all of those things but they all have to depend on a certain texture of trust\nThe question is how do you get that and the answer that I offer or something that I call political friendship\nAnd truth I'm stealing idea from the ancient philosopher Aristotle he had a theory of virtues where virtues are things that sort of hit at midway point between two extremes so for example if you take a virtue of courage its midway point between\nThere's a burning building you know people are in it and you do nothing courage is when you know that people in the building and you figure out what to do and you go in there and you deal with it you combine knowledge and motivation to do the right thing so he had this one virtue on his long list\nWhich he said was the virtue for interacting with strangers\nAnd said but no there's NO NAME for it we don't know and nobody knows what to call this thing um it's halfway how much the midpoint between being domineering and not caring what painting costs to others and being acquiesce interrupt sequel is just try to avoid all conflict making everything work somewhere there's this thing in the middle\nAnd he said it's got the habits of friendship with out the emotions of friendship\nSo that was interesting idea that I really grabbed onto the notion that the sort of virtue for interacting with strangers divert you for being a democratic citizen and a huge mass holiday like the one that we are in it was about acting to our fellow citizens as if they are our friends regardless of how we feel about them\nAnd that's what I call political friendship\nYou've written that this democracy has repeatedly failed to develop forms of citizenship to break down distrust and generate trust now are you this is a book that reference to specifically a brown versus board or are you speaking specifically racial divisions here or something broader\nWell in the book I'm interested in all kinds of divisions racial divisions class divisions divisions between the religious and secular and so forth so I think the idea that we can be politically friends with people who are very different from us applies to all of those kinds of division\nThat says the book absolutely starts from the country's racial history\nI Do think that the way race operate in the country and to some meaningful extent still continue to operate worked to make it possible for say groups of white Americans to feel more trusting of each other precisely because of the line dividing white from black and similarly\nOf trust and trustworthiness with one another that and crossing race lines and so forth so I Do think that our racial divisions meant that we haven't developed broad cross cutting habits of fostering trusted trustworthiness\nWell that seems to speak to your idea also continuing to play in the game even if you're losing in the short term [noise] it does I'm Wondering if you see a direct link between democracy and human rights for all\nThe question of the link between democracy and human rights is always a challenging one\nThe idea of democracy rats on a notion again that for all human beings the chance to shape their own lives privately and also publicly a political institutions is a part of human flourishing that's abroad universal idea\nAnd the idea of human rights is equally brought it to the notion that sort of basic human well being depends on\nPolitical participation in fact and not rights to private freedom but I just mentioned and then the human rights cannon expands beyond that also to think about social rights economic rights and so on so I think there's a very interesting question to ask about how the basic story about democracy can next to a story about human rights\nThey're not exactly the same thing there's a terrific new book actually called democracy before liberalism by Josh over that does a great job of sort of showing well here's the democracy picture here's the liberalism and the human rights picture here's where they overlap here's where they don't hear some hard questions to ask about putting them in relationship to each other\nWell you've also written about the tension between liberty and equality ah there's a school of thought that a more freedom necessarily means less equality I Know you don't agree or why well\nI think over the course of the twentieth century people began to use a mistaken definition of freedom so they understood for you to have to mean freedom from interference that as any law of any kind\nFree we also only protections from each other and the form of laws so laws do interfere with us\nThe question is whether or not our legal system dominates us or not so we all need freedom from domination but the way they get them from domination by achieving equality before the law as well as equality and political participation so freedom and equality are mutually reinforcing\nTo think otherwise depends on how they made a mistake about what freedom means in the first place\nThis seems to be a really important concept could you give us some concrete examples of how that plays out\nThe most basic thing to point to is you will find people who argue that\nAny form of taxation is an imposition on freedom\nPrecisely because any form of taxation is interference um so you can find libertarian philosophers who will make this kind of argument for example taxation is theft correct exactly yes\nUm but what that fails to recognize is that I'm so long as you were living in a society\nYou are as I said before it's participating in a game that has certain rules that makes it possible for you to generate income in the first place and that structure of rules that makes it possible for you to generate income to live a private life where you can make your own choices\nIsn't costs less it's not free it takes resources in fact to maintain that\nSo what taxation is is simply\nThe contribution that we all make to create a system that we want to use together to support our freedom so that's not it interferes with our freedom it's actually precisely the acts of taxation is the ... we need to do in order to establish the foundations for our freedom so I'm I Know that's getting a little abstract\nBut the point is simply that if you go back to the declaration of independence the language they use for this is that uh the you know we all have rights I'm human beings bill\nThe only way in which you can have rights which our freedom protecting is if you build institutions to protect those rights\nAnd taxation is the tool we use to build the institutions that protect our rights so in other words it as a tool of protecting our freedom and therefore nothing that can be said to interfere with our freedom\nI Want to ask both of you about oligarchy or Heather I Know your forthcoming book is about the tension between oligarchy of democracy in American history Daniel Allen you've obviously given this a lot of thought as well let me start with you isn't it important to give the wealthy and powerful the elite a stake in the Democratic system\nAbsolutely everybody needs to have a stake in the Democratic system including the wealthy and powerful and Heather they're usually a moments where the wealthy and powerful but ... sees that rope empowered and increased it well I think this\nGoes back to what Daniel was saying the idea that liberty means that you should not have any interference in your life from the government by taxation or by any kind of regulations by any kind of limits on what an individual can do and the problem with that historically in America has been that when people get that bit in their teeth\nAnd start to amass fortunes and start to get all kinds of land and all kinds of power they tend to take over the system they tend to buy the system uh buy into it but also to buy it\nAnd they end up creating an American government that does not in fact benefit everybody but that instead benefits themselves\nAnd when that happens I think we come very close to losing democracy and that's fairly well established in American history and there's a number of times that happened it happened in Kentucky and the Seventeen nineties\nIt happened in the south in the Eighteen fifty as it happened nationally in the Eighteen nineties you could say it happened again in the Nineteen twenties you could say we're looking at a period like that again but it seems to me a really interesting question I'm One that Danielle has written about before is how that happens how do we get to a point\nGenerous support for coverage of community issues programming ...

Idea Stream I Mike McIntyre good morning thanks so much for joining us if you're planning to cast a ballot and the upcoming general election and if you listen to us here in a good citizen so of course voting is in your plans\nToday is the deadline for you to register as my daughter who turned Eighteen just before election day said on Twitter yesterday if you're going to be Eighteen by November six please registered to vote it takes less than five minutes on line that makes a pop a proud\nTomorrow absentee voting by mail begins across the state we're now less than a month from election day one of the closest statewide races and Ohio has been the match up for governor between current attorney general Mike DeWine Republican and former attorney general Richard Cordray a Democrat recently the head of the consumer financial Protection Bureau [noise]\nThey debated last night at Cleveland State university a final with three matchups before election day Mr Cordray continued has pointed attacks Mr DeWine using his opening statement to go after his record as attorney general\nMr DeWine got his shots into and threw it all they laid out their positions on education fighting drug support for local governments women's reproductive rights and even what they admire about each other for the record it's that each of the family man here's idea streams Nick ... with a recap\nCandidate Richard Cordray and Republican Mike DeWine revisited several disagreements and they're our long debate at Cleveland State university their final one before voting begins\nThe wind the state attorney general criticized Cordray for supporting issue one which would reduce penalties for drug possession he portrayed Cordray as isolated on the proposed constitutional amendment\nThe former consumer financial Protection Bureau director replied that issue one was just one way to reform Ohio's criminal justice system and he supported others too\nTime with criminal justice reform the way he's demagogue ing issue one you think issue one was the only issue in this race there's many issues in this race\nCordray has assailed the wind over health care and last night he renewed that attack\nHe said winds lawsuit over the Affordable CARE Act if successful would have rendered useless the government's rules protecting people with preexisting conditions the wind argued that he did support insurance coverage for preexisting conditions he just didn't support Obamacare\nRight and and Jackie bordered specifically it'll she didn't mention\nIncreasing the taxes you said if you face a downturn what would you do what would you protect first Mike DeWine gets in there well if he wants to protect those thinks he's going to have to raise taxes that's a that's a bread and butter butter issue right on it but the question is is it a bread and butter issue for the undecideds in your poll shows\nAre just out today that the wine is a head of Cordray forty two percent the forty percent correct number was which was a statistical heat it is within the margin of error Eighteen percent of people undecided so when you say things like he'll raise taxes does that hit the undecided voter\nIt can but remember you're undecided typically are not partisan so they're they're likely independence or not registered as Republican or Democrat or perhaps they are but what those terms mean these days in the Arab Trump et cetera who knows\nUm but they're still looking and quite frankly I think that there are a lot of wives voters who are saying I I'm not ready to make a decision yet and with these two candidates that makes a lot of sense because in some ways they're very different ideologically\nAh but they're both very experienced very confident I don't think anybody can argue those issues\nUm but when you go back to issues like the local government fun debate et cetera um\nReally what you're getting at I think that is the challenge for wine is on the one hand yes he want to help local communities that's where the action happens in the state but on the other hand philosophically ideologically\nHe governor case took and other Republicans proceeding them believe in the idea that if you need funds for local activity you need to raise them yourselves through a boat we vote on more tax issues than any other state in the country contrasting that with Cordray he faced\nNumber that when case that came in and had to restore six billion dollar loss due to the recession in this amount is kept out about three point eight billion that money if we get into a recession situation will disappear rapidly even before you start talking about maintaining much was growing programs and that's interesting because he was put out the ... Research Center is put out a really\nGreat map that shows where all the states are in terms of how many days could they continue to fund state government based on their rainy day funds are any they find is kept we really can't go any further and it doesn't go very far when you consider how much the state does spend\nTo sustain a population of ... million people but one of the thing that I think that's interesting to get to with regard to whine and taxes is is going the other way not just raising taxes but lowering taxes because the legislature has been on a trend\nI case it talks about it a lot they've caught what is it two billion dollars in taxes over the time that he's been in office and the question for the wine potentially as well are you going to continue on this tax cutting\nWay to go especially if you've got an economic downturn had that ... what does that do then potentially to state revenues if indeed you cut taxes and you have an economic downturn\nCarlos calling in from the south side joins us now below Carlos\n... the lord and you know like the ... version of the constitution by the leaders you know to expand power privilege is you know something we see lately what I mean by that is like cocoa or\nThe other two candidates running for governor did it gets to be unlike any of these debates show because they don't have enough money just and and so while you're at a pre\nAssumed that like these two guys are the only two leaders you know it doesn't seem fair\nRight let's ask that question and and um I Know I don't know where you're going with the submarine some version of the constitution by the media in this case but you're either be commission which includes media members and others\nErkin is not happy about that they wanted to be in the debate can you give us a little bit of insight into the decision making\nRight well if you go to Ohio debate commission dot org that site actually has\nA list of an ethic you section where it talks about who actually gets to debate and ah the ... they picked the Ohio a major political parties any political party organized under the laws of the state whose candidate for governor nominees for president electric\nWere letters received not less than twenty percent of the total vote cast for such office at the most regular recent state election so that was the the barometer and the standard that the whole debate commission use\nMinor parties have gone through some rough times here in Ohio recently they uh there was a bill that was passed which Democrats referred to as the John Case that collection Protection Act back in twenty Thirteen because there was considered to be a possible threat by the Libertarian Party\nUm two cases reelection and twenty fourteen that set new rules for minor parties to establish themselves in Ohio and so that is put\nSome obstacles for people who do want to\nRepresent other parties other than the Republican Party in the Democratic party but I I Will just say that as we've talked to people in the minor party candidate or a minor parties and like I think you've had the students you're having those folks on sound of ideas coming up in the next couple of weeks\nSometimes these candidates don't have fully flushed out platforms and it can be very difficult\nTo ask candidates what are you going to do about all the different things that it did a governor has to be responsible for\nAn end to really get solid answers you can make the argument has the two candidates last night didn't have solid answers but that's I think there's more solid than some of the other minor parties quite often do\nI took issue or Carlos with the idea of media are not including folk specifically because\nOr as well as Travis Irvine and we'll have all of them on leading up to the election she can hear what their thoughts are here on our platform or you asked a question about this time in your survey uh about who would you vote for if these with these for um the ballot and and how did they fare\nWell basically what we saw was we asked the question twice on the governor's race so the first was just the head to head Republican Democrat and that's where the two point difference was with the wine that had forty two to forty for Cordray\nThen we added in the green and libertarian candidates and we ended up with a wine at forty Cordray thirty seven libertarian Travis Irvine at four percent the Green Party Constance ... Newton at three percent which is what we would expect this is perhaps a little higher\nOr sometimes you see one or two percent so that's a I Would say that's encouraging for minor parties but\nBut there's a couple of factors that go into this that have really nothing to do with media um and what Karen just mentioned about the twenty Thirteen build it passed 'em ... these are political process season they're controlled by major parties or the blunt reality is that they will if they feel a sense of\nA possible effect on their chances of winning the race they will try to block and limit the access of minor parties the Democrats basically did that in two thousand four after the two thousand presidential race when Ralph Nader some think\nHad an effect on Al Gore losing and so they essentially took the Green Party to court and every state they tried to file in a primary and Ralph Nader spent most of his money on court costs not on advertising\nAnd and if indeed you're pulled us turn out to be correct that what is at seven percent total that we go to a libertarian degrees that would be historically unprecedented in Ohio and how big it in terms of an actual about I I think\nNo party has gotten more than about three percent none of the minor parties in a state wide given a tour election so that that's another thing I ... and you know there are opportunities for\nThe minor party candidates to participate on this show their ...\nAnd I think there are a lot of people that are very interested in the idea of a minor party and and they don't want to vote typically Republican typically Democrat they they want to find somewhere else to vote but it it's it's a real challenge when the process is controlled by the major political party\nI Would also suggest very quickly that um when you started with the greens and libertarians are they both have potentially huge resources they could tap into if they could convince those resources to back them\nYou've got Tom Sawyer in California a billionaire who identifies very much is a progressive and might be sympathetic to a green candidate\nAnd the same way the Koch brothers who have been spending tens of millions of dollars on conservative libertarian leaning Republicans and stayed out of the presidential race because not only are they want to not back Trump but they were not very happy with Rand Paul who would have been like a libertarian candidate\nNeither too huge sources of revenue that they could potentially type into if they could make the case for them\nAnd I think those sources of revenue they'll have tapped into that they've they've really tried to go toward the major parties because that's where most people ... yeah because I I've interviewed Tom Sawyer definitely going after democratic voters the Koch brothers have really been working on the Tea Party and Republican voters so that's an interesting point\nBut submit see calling in from the west side missing here on welcome\nThank you so we listen to your kids the entire our last night and we thought that the question posed by the journalists were very sick and several times after a specific question we listened to what\nThe answer would be and each time we were listening for a specific answer each candidate was not talking at all to the question um I understand that that's a Kennedy do but I Would just like to say you know it's very very frustrating\nUm two examples are the question about education and you know what has would you recommend to get rid of another example that question about transportation how will you support public transportation\nAnd one more thing about debates and I think I think Tom's exactly right I think debates\nAre hugely important now I I Know I've talked to strategist you've said that really TV ads or where people make their choices but I think\nInformed voters really deserve the opportunity to hear from candidates unscripted which was the whole goal of this debate is to try to get these gentleman off the scripts that had been established for them that they've established for themselves about he caught a rape kits and the sort of thing and talk about some of these big issues\nThe governor has an awful lot of authority and to be able to ask him about some of the asked them about some of these things is really truly very important\nKind castles and great to ask you about all of this stuff

N. dot org tweet at sound of ideas\nA Leon Wilson this initiative today is a multi prong African you talk a little bit about the various prongs\nSure well um when we talk about a multi pronged effort when we're address the digital equity we're looking at it from access to the Internet were looking at it as access to affordable devices were looking at also has access to quality digital lives he trainee\nAnd apathy and awareness so that residents real life the importance and relevance of being connected to the Internet and access these social services job in climates that the church through the Internet\nFill out a job application do your homework all these things and many people take for granted ... they have an Internet connection we had a discussion here on this program within the last year with digital see the organization that was wiring up ah see I'm AJ how housing ah units in high rises\nOr how does this go with that\nIs it's I'm Glad you brought that up because it ties into why reached out to ... about a year ago\nOn the program that you talked about with digital see in him ha was warning actual seeing ha properties\nBut as you know when you're talking about CNN ha half of their half of the residents that they served are people that are on Dr recipients I'm Libby all across the county and what we want to do with how do we tackle how'd regrets digital access for those residents as well those persons that aren't actually living in a CNN ha property\nJak Patterson so can you explain to me the problem of this divide where where where do we what needs to be solved what what is not happening because of the lack of access to either equipment or just to the broadband service\nWas not happening is that a lot of times people aren't really are able to be kind of ...\nWe do is rely reliant independent ON Technology\nHaven't had access whether his kids are being able to do homework weather is folks putting in job applications whether it's something as simple as pan of bill or even I'm trying to pay your rent you know you need to have that access and it's more now than just something extra\nCars as time goes on all those uh alternatives and workarounds dead people used to have in place are going to be taken away\nAnd if you don't uh if we are able to get people up to speed right now there'll be at a disadvantage and being able to maneuver through a society\nBrian mark is with Ohio PCs for people so a PC sounds old to me right [laughter] um and I also wonder so so how does what about that name and what exactly do we mean by it and\nAnd what about phones if if there are a lot of people with phones and it seems like most people are are getting into that kind of accessibility what's different about this than just having a a access\nThrough your cell carrier sure yes those those cell phones certainly our way to help leap frog over the technology right to go uh to\nKind of the most basic of connectedness uh but when you really talk about a productivity on on a computer and on on line or you know the computers still go to work horse right uh so when we're talking about um doing homework assignments and a a job applications and resume writing and all those kinda things those are really where you need to sit down and have a full keyboard\nAnd you know and do a spell check and all that fun stuff that that we do see with the computer so\nI and we're talking about um when you say a PC is that a laptop or it's a it's a desktop unit either furnishing yeah they ...\nWhat we do is we get donations of computers from corporations and individuals we refurbish them and then we have a storefront where ah they're available if we have computers that are free and then our top line computers which include a Microsoft Windows in office the pool\nI meet a certain requirement and income requirement which is two hundred percent of poverty\nYes you have two hundred percent of poverty which we usually except either a tax return or you know that Governor governor that government benefits\nSo that's or something like twenty five thousand dollars for an individual about a thousand for a family of four around that\nOr why that number why somebody might say wow fifty thousand dollars isn't so bad for family for why that but you're finding out that the level of of of folks who are lacking access\nYeah most of the you know that's a big metric nationally as far as uh affordability and an economic uh abilities and then really are are restrictions as we're able a lot of organizations that are supportive specifically like Microsoft gives us the licenses for the windows and stuff they put restrictions on it and we're just a happy to have to connect\nWith us we're going to take a real quick break when we come back we'll hear from Leon Wilson about that as well about the idea of having equipment and some of the other projects the ideas not just having access to equipment but then encouraging how it can be used making sure that there's a tech support\nOr those types of things and what kind of a game changer would it be if everybody was wired in northeast Ohio Cleveland is ranked in the lower a portion in the country of people who are connected we'll talk about that although Cuyahoga County writ large not as bad so we'll talk about that when we get back there was a sign of ideas on Mike McIntyre back in a moment
