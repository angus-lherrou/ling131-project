the great innovations of the American constitution is it system of checks and balances each branch of government can apply a break on the others in particular Congress and the courts are supposed to check the power of the president\nBut the presidency is gathered more and more power over the last Seventy years and we now have a president who attacks Congress and the judiciary when it suits him and mounts almost daily assaults on other institutions that can hold them to account the media and the career professionals in federal agencies like the FBI and the Justice Department\nLater this hour we'll hear about the erosion of the informal unwritten rules that can lubricate the machinery of government they're often called norms and we'll look to the lessons of Watergate were checks and balances work but we begin with the formal set of checks and balances written into the constitution\nE.J Dionne is a well known commentator and columnist for the Washington Post he's also a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institute a government professor at Georgetown and a visiting professor at Harvard his most recent book is one nation under Trump which he wrote with Thomas Mann and norm ... he joined us from Cambridge\nEgypt we're looking at the workings of democracy in this series and central to that our checks and balances\nJust put together the constitution they did not assume the existence of political parties\nUh that's odd in a way because the constitution itself creative what you might call the first party system federalist an anti federalist but they did not assume that the branches would be affected\nBy party loyalty I think what you're seeing in this period since Trump's election is a Republican Party that has largely decided not to play it's traditional role in Congress\nThat the Congress rather than being a check on the president is choosing to support him in the courts particularly the lower courts\nWe're going to see if the Supreme Court proves to be a check or a reason\nTo doubt that the biggest check we do have is not so much in the constitution although as part of the constitution it's in the larger acceptance\nOf small D democratic values in the country so the checks are outside the government both in political mobilization which is happening in a big way in the country and also in a free media which is doing a lot of the investigating that Congress isn't doing\nI think one of the things we forget when we sort of go back to the Watergate period\nIs that in Watergate you had all of the institutions working in tandem to hold the president accountable the courts played a critical role in this\nCongressional investigations played a critical role in this for a member of that the Congress was controlled by Democrats and obviously the media played a critical role now you are missing important pieces in that system of checks and balances and I think we are so far see the outcome\nOf how we got here EJ when people look at the Supreme Court today for it\nProcess started all the way back in the Reagan Administration when Reagan's attorney general Edwin Meese very famously said the idea was\nTo institutionalize the Reagan Revolution so they can't be set aside no matter what happens in future presidential elections the plan was simply to cement conservative majority in the courts so it didn't matter but voters dead and there's been surprisingly little pushback on that over the years are we really seeing anything that's in any way new\nUh yes it in some ways it goes back even before\nMakes political argument much more difficult because if he at least you agree on facts you can argue about what to do about them if you don't agree on facts anymore\nThen there's almost no way to carry on a coherent argument and I worry that that's the direction we're going in\nEgypt tapes to me you're describing a system we're certainly the Republican Party and increasingly both parties are interested more in part is an advantage in idiom logical purity as you describe it how do we get back to a system where there are at least in crises more interested in the national interest\nYou know there's an interesting case and it's a very controversial one where partisanship did disappear for a moment of crisis\nAnd that was the bank bailout back in two thousand eight and the irony there is the bank bailout was called for by President Bush will Republican the bulk of the votes for the bail out came from Democrats in Congress\nThey didn't much like it either but there was a feeling that in the middle of this crisis when the entire economy could collapse if this didn't happen no matter what injustices might be involved in the bank bailout\nThe damage to everyone would have been worse so we at least have some occasions when we come together we also came together in a remarkable way obviously after nine eleven when President Bush's approval rating rose to the eighties or\nThe Iraq War afterward I Would note that in both of those cases it was largely Democrats went over to the other side and said All right we're going to support Bush even though we didn't like this\nAnd after nine eleven there was a decision made that we wanted to unite behind our president who many Democrats\nDisagreed with I'd like to think that would be good is circumstances like that when Republicans would do that for a Democratic president I just haven't seen that in recent years I'd like to believe that it's true the one clear example on the other side is when um\nSyria across President Obama's red line\nThe beginning of a second term in using chemical weapons it is true that John Boehner the speaker and Eric Cantor the number two Republican supported President Obama but there was so much opposition in the Republican Party and as well as\nThe Democratic party that there was no agreement reached so we haven't really seen some occasions when a national threat brought people together\nI Hope we will see a clear example of that on the Republican side some day in this period those have been very hard to find I'm very sorry to say\nWe've talked about the checks and balances of the different branches of government on themselves and each a you in the past have talked about the fourth and most important check on the political system\nAnd that's a check the voters you've talked a lot about the role of voters and making sure that they have control over their government and you have some interesting ideas about how we can make that happen\n[noise] right well I Am for an idea that's going to take a long time if ever to take hold which is what I call universal voting and what is in Australia called compulsory attendance at the polls where I think that there should be an obligation on all of us to vote\nHow it works in Australia is people pay a very small fine if they don't vote it's not onerous\nCivic duty one of the reason I like this idea is that it suddenly changes the obligations of state and local governments they would have to stop\nMaking it more difficult to vote and begin to make it easier for people to do their civic duty so that's one thought I have a second thought I have is and and a lot of other people have obviously is some kind of single transferable vote system where\nOne of the problems in our system is if in a given election you are inclined to vote for a third party candidate the very likely outcome of that vote or one very likely outcome of that vote is you help elect the candidate you released like\nAmong the two party candidates it discourages third party voting obviously but it also can create non majority area and outcomes with the transferable boat\nYou put a number one next to your first choice which might be a third party candidate but then you can put a number to next to say to the candidate for one or the other parties that\nIs closest to your view that guarantees that the winner in some sense reflect a majority view but it also creates gives creates some give\nIn the political system I Am not anti partied myself I don't see how you organize a democratic system without parties\nAnd I think we're barking up the wrong tree if we\nUh say all our problems are caused by political parties if only they would go away if this party system went away it would be replaced by another party a system because people come together\nTo with people who are more or less their allies to try to influence government that's democracy but there are moments when the system\nNeeds some lubrication some adjustments\nUm you know into the ideas that I Am sympathetic to the transferable vote in a universe\nThe idea that the government must guaranteed everybody votes as opposed to members of different political parties trying to make sure that their opponents don't vote seems to me to be a really interesting and very effective way to make sure that that final check and balance on the government that of voters actually works\nRight and one of the reasons I'm I think universal boating might gain some support overtime although I Know it's a long shot\nIs that it does two things one amenable to progressive and wasn't amenable to more middle of the road people on the one hand it would increase the turnout of young people of lower income people who are often the folks most kept away by various\nMeasures to make it harder to vote on the other hand it would also make our system somewhat less city a logical because\nMany of the voters who stay away from elections or people with less hard hardened idiot logical views and so the combination of those too could be\nI think secretary Chu the political debate I mean I Am unapologetically a person to the center left I\nAm very clear about my own views but I actually think it would be useful for both sides to have to make a case to voters who don't necessarily share of their particular uh\nUh eighty allergy that that is has been the effect down in Australia where the system has worked very well and I like to say we got the secret ballot from Australia so why don't we import this idea to\nFor being with us today Jay this has been a wonderful looking at America's checks and balances and it why sometimes they don't work and how we can maybe get back to a place where they work better than they seem to be working today it's

checks and balances built into our constitution restrained the power of the president\nThough they created a chief executive the framers took care to make sure the president was not a king some of those restraints are written into law but many others are not\nFor a hundred and fifty years for example there was an informal agreement that no president would serve more than two terms the president was established by George Washington and observed by every one of his successors\nUntil Franklin Delano Roosevelt two years after FDR's death in office Congress passed a congressional amen\nJulia is Ari and Jennifer ... published a groundbreaking paper on political norms and the Democratic values they represent\nThat suggests that the broad category of what executive power is encompasses all sorts of different practices you know we saw a lot of that with George W. Bush and the war on terror it's not like that's new but I think it is\nNew and as it concerns presidential conduct much of the time\nWe don't think of that as being related to legal technicality is in that way\nWell and that goes back to what you were saying earlier about Congress sort of dropping the ball pushing back on the president the whole concept was the three branches of government would be very concerned about their own power and so they would constantly push back against each other so when any one of them gets weak or starts to work for the others were kind of in trouble\nRight I think that's right and you know as we think about other instances where presidential conduct has been a problem about Bill Clinton thing about Richard Nixon and both of those instances there was divided government and Congress pushed back\nIn ways you know for Clinton didn't and his presidency but I think you know in some way she sort of got the message that they were people that didn't approve of how he had\nConducted himself and obviously for Nixon and ultimately ended his his presidency whether that kind of check can occur under unified government I think it's still a little bit of an open\nQuestion by unified government you mean when one party controls or the White House in both branches of Congress\nDirect when one party controls all of it which you know may not be the situation for that much longer so we shall see\nEveryone could have something else you've talked about and that's a shift compared politics today to the political system we had an Eighteen Ninety six and you have a really interesting take on it so why don't you tell us what you mean by that [noise] yeah so\nThat piece came out in July of two thousand sixteen and we wrote that piece thinking about the rise of populism thinking about the concept of a of a new gilded age\nThose were the things that we were really thinking about there in terms of parallels just try and get flush out the idea of is there really anything that has happened before\nThing I Would say about that pieces I kinda think back on it as did a lot of the conceptualization of that paper and twenty Fifteen and early twenties sixteen so I kind of cringe to think about how it does or doesn't apply after the\nElection well okay so what I was going for there was that you argue in it that in the Eighteen nineties as well as in the present you have parties that are very evenly matched the ballot box\nThey appear to many voters to look pretty much the same and they are incredibly vitriolic and what you suggested about that period is that in the Eighteen nineties is it that was the precursor to an entirely different party system\nAnd I'm Wondering if you would say the same today in two thousand and Eighteen looking at where the parties are in those particular parallels\nI saw a lot about this and a lot about the possibilities for change in ways that are not I don't I don't know they're totally reflected in in that piece and there are two things that I keep coming back to one is that our current situation\nIs a recipe for very stale and stagnant parties it's very difficult for the parties to change\nNegative partisanship makes the system very resistant to third parties and I know that's not normally hear from political scientist right political science doesn't tell you that\nHaving electro college and single member of congressional districts majority ... majority rule and makes it that's why we don't have their party\nBut third party is bubble up periodically in American history and they take up ten percent twenty percent of the vote in a presidential election and they kind of\nChanged the agenda right they don't win office but they they changed the agenda and they channel new ideas and that really I think strikingly\nTerrified to cross the aisle it means that elite don't both their parties at the same rate that they use to to to start new ones\nYou know that may be good or bad in various ways but I think it makes the party system very stagnant and you don't see the same possibilities for change that you did through the Eighteen nineties and then the early part of the the twentieth century you had different factions in in both parties that were kind of\nPushing back against that established institutional structure is pushing back against the shape of the gilded age political economy\nThings like that um that's you know kind of what I see in terms of the possibilities for change the only thing I think is that in political science we've maybe moved away from some of the theories\nThat would explain how we get out of these periods of close competition and vitriol and stagnation we used to call them ... minutes we used to say All right the new majority formed around new issues and there was this\nElection in which that happened realignment theory has kind of fallen out of favor in political science in part because when you do scrutinize those election patterns a lot of those claims start to crumble but we haven't replaced it with anything in terms of a big kind of idea about\nHow we get out of those periods so how you get from\nFrom Eighteen Ninety six to Nineteen thirty to for example\nWe've referred several times in this conversation to your colleague Jennifer Smith [noise] ah she died this past August much too young we're sorry for your loss and ours\nThank you Julia sorry thank you for being with us Julia sorry teaches political science at Marquette University and thanks for being here thank you so much\nThe one moment in American history that may bashed in body the principle of\nWhite House into a criminal conspiracy never really gauge has another theory yes the Washington Post judge Johnson wreck and Senator Sam urban all play an important parts\nBut she believes that the standard Watergate narrative overlooks another key player the federal bureaucracy specifically\nThe Federal Bureau of investigation that really gauge teaches twentieth century American political history Yale and she's the author of the new book gene man J Edgar Hoover and the American century she joins us from New haven welcome to the democracy test\nThanks for having me really it's easy to think of J Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon as political allies comrades an anti communist fervor but you argue that they were in fact in deep conflict\n[noise] they were both at the same time so they had in fact spent by the time Nixon became president spent a lifetime or at least since the late forties in a pretty close friendship and political alliance\nThat that was built as you say around anti communism and also around kind of shared outlook about Washington so they liked each other quite a lot\nOf 'em they conspired together about all sorts of things including Hoover really supported Nixon being elected in Nineteen sixty eight though he did it quietly but once Nixon became president they came into conflict pretty quickly\nUh one of the things Nixon really wanted to do when he came to office was what he called politicized the bureaucracy\nHe felt that all sorts of federal civil servants were not nearly as responsive to the president as he would like them to be they didn't serve his political purposes and he really wanted to do that\nUnfortunately J Edgar Hoover wanted no such thing and he was a pretty powerful man at that point and that brought them into some serious conflict\nWell for himself died just before the Watergate break in right he did so Hoover died in\nBetty before that the FBI had had\nSome pretty serious showdowns with the Nixon White House over some of the some of the elements that ultimately led to Watergate so for instance Nixon\nReally wanted the FBI to be doing some of his political investigating of Daniel Ellsberg for instance Hoover thought that was a very dangerous thing for the FBI to be doing he refused to do some of what makes them want it and that's actually why Nixon created his uh his famous unit known as the plumbers\nThe plumbers to stop leaks right but even though Hoover was dead institution he created and had run for half a century remain behind and you focused on a man who spent Thirty years steeped in the culture of Hoover's FBI\nA man named Mark Felt who most people know as Deep Throat the man who was Bob Woodward's invaluable source in unraveling what had happened with Watergate\nSo why did a really kind of buttoned down gee ma'am like Mark felt\nTurn on President Nixon\nOne of the I think he an unrecognized parts of the Watergate story is that it happened in the midst of a really big battle over the succession crisis at the FBI so when Hoover died in May of Nineteen Seventy two he\nHad been there for forty eight years as head of the FBI and that meant that there were many many figures and the FBI who have been going to waiting around for Hoover either to retire or to die so that they could take over and these were men who had been trained by Hoover\nWho had spent

and they're very effective at that I'm now of course there's a big difference between um policing images and policing a ... a words because images we can use ... machine learning to seek those things out um but we also see on Twitter or where\nIn in places where there are laws against that for example Germany where a Nazi content is illegal or Twitter does\nA much better job at restricting those sorts of messages\nAre in those communities I think what they bounce up against is this belief that the ... the the freedom of speech is an important idea\nUm and there's the concern that if they\nGo too far in their censorship or or their moderation which is a term I prefer instead of censorship but if they go too far that will result in a backlash in many ways this gab dot com was a response to Twitter deep lot forming a neo Nazi voices are in two thousand sixteen\nYou did talk about the idea that it's a business we'd have to realize that it's not just there for our benefit or enjoyment our cat videos or whatever they are designed all these companies lay power I'm barb from that so much pay pal but Google and Twitter they're designed to keep you there right and they don't want to chase you away because of something that may be on the fringe those pretty deep before they're gonna change it off\nYeah and and and the the disconcerting thing is that though the business model and the algorithms that few of them are based on engagement and what social science research has taught us and what research into social sharing has taught us is that the things that are most engaging are\nThat drive us to greater a greater engagement and so are you to for example a has been pointing and many ... scenarios to being a a very potent tool for radicalization because it's so easy to go from\nA relatively benign video\nA that has maybe aspects of things like Holocaust denial which\nI'm most people were not going to seek out actively but they they watch one video that's that's a little bit on on on the on the barrier and all of a sudden the algorithm based on previous history and based on what the computer knows about what keeps people on YouTube longer will serve up videos\nThat will increasingly take that person down a very dark rabbit hole um and and YouTube's ah the algorithm is not thinking well I Want to promote Holocaust denial you to the algorithm and saying I Want to keep people on YouTube and unfortunately that's demonstrated to be a very strong way of doing that\nWho is the populations were talking about here we we talked in generalities but are there older people who are discouraged younger people who aren't as media literate who's falling into these rebels\nAre I think that you can you can look at a few different camps um obviously if you look at the news recently um we're not talking about a ... a young people uh uh the shooting in Pittsburgh the the the alleged pipe bomber in Florida um these are these are men in their in their fifties um there is\nA those\nAre groups that are a isolated in other parts of of their communities or feel empowered and other parts of their lives that are always going to seek out um conspiracy messages or a information that is detached from reality because it is a way of\nUh providing some control over their of their life um conspiracy theories or hate speech they always are a it's a it's a safer answer from a a psychological perspective than having to admit that I've made bad decisions or or uh my life is\nSo they can't find 'em you can also look that increasingly young people who have really limited life experience when it comes to a pre Internet age or a concept of a mainstream information verified information these are not people who grew up with\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica on their bookshelf representing the idea of\nConfirmed knowledge and so um what concerns me about the use of YouTube for I'm finding information which are many people to\nIs how quickly that the algorithm can take you places you don't want to go um I had a student wants um a few years ago who knowledge college student goes yes who who um uh he was a young man I'm\nCurious about the world but didn't have a lot of uh experience with the concepts of where you should get your information and and it started to be in semester he was talking about he was he thought big foot was real and by the end of semester without malice but through seeking out information I knew he was talking about whether or not the Holocaust that happened um report\nThis week and saying something like sixty seven percent of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is they've never been schooled in the Holocaust\nRight and and and that that that presents a real challenge when um when you become inured to the idea that information online is malleable um and if that is what you expect and that's what all you've known 'em it becomes really hard then to counteract information like this by saying\nYou know by fact checking it well here's this external here's this trustworthy source the idea of a ... where the source versus an untrustworthy source isn't as clear as it was in the days when I'm you know there was two newspapers in your town and Walter Cronkite was on TV\nRight and ... so many people go there you can puts on the other nine twenty eight I can change of the nine twenty nine absolutely Rio let's take another phone call we got some folks on the line waiting let's go to the south side were Carlos has been waiting thank you sir welcome in some divide is\nOh You're welcome to take political ads\nAre like of attack ads really sit back and we see the same thing on television a lot to think that violence like that it it uh a political ...\nIn the attack ads could incite people think that it's bad for the Republican then they watch you know just not be as social media but like all ACT UP because what they see on the political as they do\nGreat question goes yeah it can be more than just what you're typing and see you on that screen\nAbsolutely I mean there is there's definitely been a trend in recent years towards a more aggressive rhetoric um from\nFrom all corners or whether it's from politics whether it's on line\nAnd one of the the things that that presents challenges is\nAs we increasingly tell people that that hope is lost or that we increased their feeling of powerlessness we run the greater risk that they will lash out in a way\nThat leads to tragedy doesn't mean that everybody who consumes this information is going to be violent but when you uh you know in ... especially when you convince someone that they're they're in a corner or that their way of life is being challenged um many of the quotes attributed to the the shooter in Pittsburgh or address the idea that he was under the belief that his\nHis people um whatever that has to mean in his mind his people were were under attack or were were being threatened with genocide\nAnd so the more we spend time talking about these sort of ah we we play up these existential threats the more likely we make it that that people who have a lost touch with reality are going to feel they need to do something about it\nOkay to go to line three were Jeff is on from earth world to welcome to the sound bite is what your thoughts\n[noise] um I I don't I just talked about this or not but there's discussion it's all said all focused on Facebook Twitter these sites as analogous to the comments you know free speech issues when they're really in August of the plush we should be comparing them to hound\nKnow newspapers way to think of as being vetted or series process was that it goes through editors would look at things which Facebook Twitter et cetera don't how but he's saying that that can be skewed as well\nThe idea that people come into this with a lot of misconceptions about movie about the book was part of your goals ... on a string brings up with a ... shall we wanted to be\nWell certainly I think not enough people read the book and um you know that too many people only have the vision of you know forest Carla ... green monster who of course in the movie isn't even green because the black and white and [laughter] uh and\nSo to understand the other layers that Shelley's novel offers us yet [noise]\nWould've among some representing according to her\n[noise]\nWell [noise] but that's hard [laughter] that's a hard question\nTo answer I mean certainly scholars have been trying to figure that out for two hundred years um some of the things we think perhaps that represents one is a question of\nChildbirth and the relationship of parents and children she lost her own mother when she was ten days old I'm very well and craft died\nDue to complications childbirth she herself lost all of her children except one I'm early in childhood to this question of what does it mean to be a parent and why does it mean to be a child um is one thing people have have\nRead the novel has representing given that Victor Frankenstein advocates all were spanked\nResponsibility for his own child so to speak um in terms of his creation certainly that question of\nHow far should scientists go she's responding to a lot of um [noise] the scientific discoveries of her time period Galvin ism and early ... cameras all just\nAnd I'm thrilled exploration with the air as it does the guy on the ship and I'm a and you know what what should we be exploring what should we not be exploring think all of those are tied in\nThere was such an engaged audience I got an email coming in from a listener who says Shirley wrote Frankenstein as her way of opposing research from animals did you come across that study as well\nUm [noise] that's interesting because she talked so much about animals in the book itself\nWhat about other books that you wrote other writings that she did them\nI don't know much about I that is not a study that I had a red may be branding us more about that one\nNo I've not come across a across that so I think in the sense that\nWhat you might be picking up on is Mary Shelley was certainly engaged with the idea that science and medicine was messy a and Galvin isn't particularly there's a lot of dead frogs involved in ...\nUh and ... who was ... I'm ... did some other somewhat messy experiments and so you know I don't know that\nIt's necessarily anti animal experimentation but a real caution around experimentation in general and you know what are the limits the difference between the can and should of science\nBefore y'all but as for beef oh sorry [laughter] um [laughter] read but right right so a go Vonnie\nWas a gentleman who thought that he believes in what's called the animal electricity and his concept was that only God makes electricity it's made in living bodies and that's where electricity comes from and he got this idea because of touching dead frogs legs with wires and things and and watching them jump\nAnd he just kind of missed mistook cause and effect\nHe was a guy by [laughter] which I don't know\nDead frogs legs and hung them on a ... tale and flu during a storm which is the most terrifying kite ever imagine being a child and finding that guy\nUm what does that [laughter] but he goes on is what he was trying to prove is that uh if it was just sort of God directed animal created electricity and his opponents in this was vote to which is where we get the terms galvanized enrolled edge a vote to was the one who first invented the battery to show that in fact electricity was not\nSomething that you could be manmade and that really changed the course of history\nNick that virtually no about animal gr up people or any kind of clothing when she wrote for him so\nI'm no most likely not at least not by that name um [noise] you know cones natural quotes of existed for for many many years I mean identical twins are technically human cloning\nUm but the the kind of artificial cloning um was really first considered a in the in the ... century the first animal to actually successfully be clone a was frog\nOddly enough [laughter] to offer the Nineteen sixties um but uh but after that there was kind of a pause until Dolly the sheep was found in Nineteen Ninety seven now Dolly being a mammal\nA kind of open the door then because people saw that there was really no scientific barrier to cloning any other kind of mental including human beings\nRuns or to look at where Frankenstein has let us and take your phone calls after a short break we'll continue about the idea that we can draw from the war classic listening to the sound of ideas emerge Jackson we will be right back [noise]\n\nThe conversation by calling you won six five seven eight zero nine zero three or send an email to that's why at UC P.
