like public library\n[noise] this term carries a consciousness of the outside world as a potentially dangerous place how is this nation to stay secure to stay safe\nWhere are the threats what are the best ways to reduce them these questions don't necessarily come with clear answers Russia is that threat exaggerated or Iran does getting tougher on Iran makes sense for NATO as an alliance does that alliance itself still make sense\nWell we think these issues are nuanced and difficult\nAnd therefore eminently debatable\nSo let's do it I'm John Donvan here with our live audience a symphony space in New York City for this one we are using the format we call unresolved in which five debaters vigorously debate independently they are not an teams they're all flying solo and they're taking on not just one right\nPlease let's meet our debaters first welcome Derek show a [noise]\nIf you\nCome back to intelligence squared you are executive vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the United states or you had a number of post senior posts and the Obama administration including assistant secretary of defense\nFor international security affairs co editor of a foreign policy blog called shadow government written by members of of a group to describe themselves as the loyal opposition what exactly do we mean by loyal opposition\nWell it's not the deep state uh but it's it's approaching problems wanting of course what's good for the country but doing so not being reflexively partisan\nOr being brave enough to not pull punches and say when the administration is getting it wrong but also uh having the courage to say when it's getting it right that's been courage I've had use rarely recently\nA bed very important so thanks very much later in the ones that can Derek show lay\nHim Steven going [noise]\nEven to intelligence\nSquared us You're contributing editor at the nation professor emeritus of Russian studies at NYU ended at Princeton author of a lot of books including one that's about to come out Cold War with Russia a dissenting narrative from putting in Ukraine to Trump and Russia gate you have\nBeen really really interested in Russia since your college days where where did that will start\nWhen I was young before most if you were born I was in Birmingham, England finishing your study I had left thirty days in three hundred bucks\nI intended because I read him anyway to go to Spain and watch the bulls run but I was walking in the working class district to Birmingham and I saw a sign thirty days in the Soviet Union for three hundred dollars [noise]\nI was no dummy I got on the ship I saw\nThe world and that became my state nobles I never made it to the bulls\n[laughter] sorry to hear the legendary once again Stephen\nCalling [noise] argue about them courage Jackie [noise] sorry welcome back\nTo intelligence squared your deputy director general of the international Institute for Strategic studies you served on the national Security Council under President George W. Bush you helped create NATO's ally command transformation and the NATO response force you have been critical of President Trump but you've called on your friends and they diminished ration\nNow back to the debate [noise]\nLet's have some discussion we have a three nose on this resolution and these nose or actually\nA reverse negative in this case those those are actually supportive of NATO and we have to yeses which are very skeptical of NATO what I heard on this conversation so far with a lot of focus\nOn Russia before that the Soviet Union and the security of Europe but I Want to point out that NATO is also operating in Afghanistan and Kosovo and in the Mediterranean these are these things have nothing to do with Europe that says I don't know if you would call this mission creep or what else\nBut I Want you to take on that aspect of NATO's being fit for purpose what is its purpose\nIf it's not a limited to the security of Europe\nSays one thing all of those military operations you named have in common is that it was the United states who dragged our European allies into participating in them so one reason that NATO is set for ... because it is the way we organize\nThe most capable countries most willing to help us\nDo what we want to do in the world\nAnd I would just remind people that the only time that NATO's mutual defense pledge what's called in was after September eleventh in defense of us\nAre John Mearsheimer picked as long as you just want to make two points one is that when you talk about NATO from a favorable point of view it's all part of a story where the United states has a responsibility\nAllies because they can help us in all these crazy escapades that we engage in where we get our nose bloody delivery [laughter]\nThat'd be the Europeans were really wonderful in helping us destabilize Libya and create all sorts of problems not only in Libya with ... but with regard to refugees inside of Europe furthermore NATO expansion which is all designed just to keep NATO will live\nHas failed miserably or more and now more deeply involved in Eastern Europe than ever when we should be either pivot to Asia or spending the money here in the United states on the question\nOf the pivot to Asia real well John Mearsheimer was saying we have limited resources and there are more dangerous places that we should be failing to them paying attention to for example China we can't do both what about that well\nOne I think we can do both we historically have done both whether we choose to bear the burden is a different issue I think you can check the Chinese but it's going to be a risky process we're going to have to stand firm on Taiwan\nFor the says but to the point of NATO you're saying though to no way would you say that the need to do to deal with on a cancels\nOut I mean again we're not talking now if you add all this money off it's comparatively to what we spend on domestic affairs it's been us\nSteven calling um royal set in his opening statement that it's tempting fate to pull out of your meaning I think what he's saying fate actually is is Russia um take that on\nWhat we've got to do that when we get to the Russia threat and I don't think there's any but I'd like to coral little with what I read in the paper every day that NATO is quote the greatest military alliance in the history of the world you know ... that's right\nWell first of all NATO hasn't fought a war is an alliance yet so we really not sure about that Second Life when NATO does fight wars it's a handful of willing partners with the United states the coalition of the willing but look at the war\nThose with liberal illusions would agree Iraq was a disaster where's this greatest military alliance in the world where is the security it's brought\nHaving friends to fight alongside you doesn't add guarantee that you're going to fight the right wars or have the right strategy and it means you don't have to do it all by yourself\nAnd so the part of the answer to that China rising is it's going to be a lot easier to manage a rising China is as there's now already happening Britain and France are helping us police freedom of navigation the Japanese are helping us do that\nThat that are helping us do that it seems to me like leaders that we would have\nMore wars if you didn't have the NATO alliance to rural Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries out of\n[noise] I'm actually sort of astonished and I'm proud that I mean the Europeans have lasted as long as\nThey have in Afghanistan a I have to give them credit I may not have gotten that way in two thousand I mean let's\nLet's be Frank I mean the the welfare states and Europe having trouble the military in Europe or that they were able actually to come out to deploy the forces they did I think it's quite commendable I Wish they'd stayed longer I Wish they would spend more money but I Would just repeat a little story that was told to me by the British\nDeputy commander of ice up when I was in Afghanistan one time and I asked him about the various European contributions and he said you know the French ... comes to me once every two weeks and he says the thing that makes the American and the British commanders hearts just start to ... batter and that is\n... do you want to keep\nDrier that gives the sign of a good hour John Mearsheimer [laughter]\nI I just want to pick up on rose points to the European\nMilitaries are feeble militaries\nE for defense and uncles soccer page the money to protect them\nAnd the idea that the Europeans are going to help us contain China is not a serious argument these countries have no power projection capability if we weren't in Europe protecting them they'd have to spend more money on themselves and we'd be free to pivot to Asia and we'd be free to fix the New York subways\nI hired somebody I'll check that out [laughter]\nWe are certainly in Europe to help protect your but the Europeans are partners as we project our power in the world and we can have a debate of the right or wrong way to protect us power and whether the right decisions have been made but the U.S has never gotten into a fight because the NATO allies have dragged us into that fight when you go to Europe when you go to the Baltics\nWhen you go throughout Western Europe France Germany you you hear this this demand for the United states I mean think of the drama we had over the summer when President Trump went to the NATO summit and talked about\nWhether or not the U.S would stay in the alliance and there's panic throughout the European continent they're worried that the United United States is going to go away that us leadership is going to be diminished I think it was a reason for that they're asking for us\nThey want us to be there with them and that's a very very unique position for a country to be in Russia and China do not have those kinds of problems\nAnd this is this is an asset for us that we can squander with the wrong decisions and the wrong kind of leadership and that includes discussion of the\nResolution [noise]\n\nWe're moving out to our next resolution it deals with Russia yes Russia makes trouble for the U.S interfering in elections meddling in the middle east but just how potentially dangerous is Moscow to the U.S really it has nukes but\nAn unimpressive economy it has ... but a plethora of domestic problems might we'd be over worrying\nOverblown making the opening statement in regard to this question Steven calling on the resolution the Russian threat is overblown do you declare yes or no\nYeah and you could write a book about it and in fact I just\nLet me\nLet me just wrap it up and I don't even Ninety seconds [noise]\nBruton Russia's represents absolutely no threat to the United states except those threats we ourselves up provoked\nMainly through NATO ex expansion proven himself contrary to the newspapers has not been mainly and aggressive leader you would think that's his middle name but are reacting later Russia Today like it or not\nIs again a very great world power certainly militarily and diplomatically\nHere in lies the tragedy and all this all stop prudence rush\nAnyone's Russia should be America's number one national security partner in the world\nWashington's squander that opportunity after Nineteen Ninety One and it's continued to squander it today by inventing are provoking threats resigning in Russia which do not exist\nFactors didn't going [noise] to stay\nOn the resolution that Russia threat is overblown Corey shocking do declared yes or no I agree that\nThe rest of the threat is overblown but not as\nBecause the Russians pose no threat to us our desire to pose no threat to us at the invasion of Ukraine the invasion of Crimea the invasion of Georgia their military exercises that they are holding simulating nuclear weapons you send the Baltic states a quiet\n[noise]\n\n\nWe are we're halfway through this intelligence squared us debate are five panels were debating the state and the future of American national security\nAnd now you Ron I'm always high on the list of us security concerns and aspiring a nuclear power\nThe backer of terrorism with the perpetual question isolate Iran squeeze it or try to coax this radical nation and to more moderate behavior\nIt's the choice that is at the heart of our final resolution it is time to take a hard line on Iran Derek chalet on that resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran you declare yes or no\nI mean yes but I Am a yes but you know explain um Iran provides material and political support to those who are trying to destabilize the middle east Iran's forces have been responsible for the deaths of thousands in places like Syria runs proxies had killed Americans civilians and our troops\nAnd Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons so of course it's time to take a hard line against Iran or that begins by forging the strongest possible international consensus\nIran must know that its actions have consequences whether in form of economic pressure political isolation or even military response in other words the best way to take a hard line is to present a United front\nAnd that's what the Iran nuclear deal did\nThe Iran nuclear deal did not solve all of our problems and with Iran but it did put the brakes on them is urging serious ones so taking a hard line needs to be more than a slogan needs to be a means to an end it's not just about talking to us than beating your chest it's about pursuing smart policies that you get you closer to your goals thank\nYou ... [noise] the resolution is kind of hard line on Iran Steven Cohen on this resolution to declare yes or no that's you know\nYou know Jerry I I mean I I I kinda\nThat have been set about Russia I'll take I'll take your shoes for sure but my feeling is is that the United states or Trump as we like to call the United states today having left the nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions\nI asked myself what would a harder line result it's likely to create instability inside Iran\nThat is likely to spread to Iraq and Syria and elsewhere in the middle east and I don't see that is good for anybody certainly it certainly would at least theoretically risk for depending on how hard is hard liners and that could involve the United states Israel and possibly Russia\nIt will then increase Russia's military and energy producing role in the world because\nThey've been going on sorry under time's up thank you very much\n[noise]\nGoing out to Korea shockey on the resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran please tell us how you declare\nIs time to take a harder line on Iran they are the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world they're arming Hezbollah and Hamas they are keeping bus\nBashar al Assad I'm In power at and they are occasionally interdict thing shipping and the straits of Hormuz through which an enormous amount of the world's oil trans that's\nAh so so yes we should take a harder line both\nThe Trump Administration and the Obama administration had an unbelievable policy namely either you stop to nuclear weapons program or we will destroy it and I don't think that's credible out if either of the two governments we need a wider range of tools ah to manage the Iran problem at\nAddicts core the Iran problem is that that domestic legitimacy on the foreign policy of Iran\nMine on Iran doesn't result in Iran stopping doing these things that could very shocking [noise]\nIt's time to take a\nHard line on Iran John Mearsheimer do declare yes or no I say no\nI take this resolution is a question uh dealing with President Trump's decision in May of this year to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran and uh I think that that was a fundamental mistake of the question\nIs [noise]\nQuestion you want to ask yourself is what countries want nuclear weapons they want nuclear weapons because they understand they are the ultimate deterrent and if you're threatened you really want to have nuclear weapons why does Israel has nuclear weapons because it's leaders think they live in a dangerous neighborhood where they want to have the ultimate deterrent and they're back pocket\nWhat was good for the goose is good for the gander so there's going to be a very powerful incentive for the Iranians to think the same way\nNow the hawks believed that you can get really tough with the Iranians and you can beat them in to give up nuclear weapons for ever I don't think that's going to happen\nFirst of all it's just going to reinforce the hard liners inside of Iran and second of all nationalism is a very powerful force and the idea that you could push the Iranians around I think is a misguided thought\nThat could\nTake a hard line on Iran last in the lineup of panelists to declare yes or no royal marker act are you a yes or no\nUh I say I mean this is one of those issues that I think the Trump Administration was actually on the right thing I have to commend it at a stop the surreal situation where the United states was\nFeeding tens of billions of dollars and to the Islamic republic into itchy eyes imperialism throughout the region for a short rest said for the production\nThat his gauge the mass slaughter in Syria\nWhy we would want to give money to a stage that is building his laws throughout the Shiite regions of the middle east I just think this is not particularly since the Jaycee peel away with such a very very bad deal it's as leaky it's got as many holes in Swiss cheese in it I Would also add\nThe demonstrations that have been going on in Iran since December ought to tell you they're not shouting out down with America Don with Donald Trump they're showing down with the regime down with the revolutionary guard\nCorps Missouri\n[noise] and I think that the resolution it's\nTime to take a hard line on Iran looking at\nThe opening round we have three I says and who knows I Want to go to Corey shockey with some points made by people on the no side which seemed to all come down to the question of dangerous unintended consequences of taking a harder line on Iran and the one hand Steven Cohen saying you would risk war dangerous unintended consequences what about that\nYes I think there are dangerous unintended consequences for confronting Iran destabilizing and dangerous behavior but they're also dangerous unintended consequences of not confronting\nAllowing Iran to continue to destabilize regional governments to interject that as free commerce through the strength to farm is\nTo continue to be a state sponsor of terror recall that the Iranian government tried to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington DC so not confronting saying bad restaurant yeah\nAlso also has the potential to encourage incentivize continued Iranian malign behavior\nActually well look this is the land of no good options right when I was at the Pentagon during the negotiations of the Iran nuclear deal I had nothing to do with the negotiations\nNow we have options yeah US military has has has shown over the years that it can do all sorts of things overthrow governments put a lot of firepower in particular targets but those those are not particularly palatable options so I Would argue we were in a better position where we had isolated the nuclear problem\nRules right temporarily ten to Fifteen Years so we could work on the other aspects of Iran's behavior that posts such a threat to the United states the problem now that we pulled out of the nuclear deal when you go to Europe when you go up the middle east what they're talking about is American policy not Iran's policy\nAnd I don't believe that Iran has actually benefited that much from the uh the nuclear deal I mean you're on and people were on the streets and they actually thought the nuclear deal was a bad deal for them so the idea that now we're going to engage in some sort of negotiation to get a better deal from from our perspective we're still for Iran to me is fantasy John ...\nYeah I I Want to respond to a point that Korea made and tied in to a point to roommate you're critical of the Iranians for destabilizing regimes in the region is there any country that's destabilized more regimes than the United states\nOf America\nRespects funny I Want to bring the topic back to the focus back to Iran at the moment and go and you know I I understand but I Want to bring another dimension that we haven't discussed yet which is this notion\nThat's been out there since the Islamic republic came to be that there's a there's a moderate element there's a there's a there's a there's a group there to go to although the first ... do you believe there is a moderate elements of play to to engage with taking a hard line work to enhance that or would it\nGenerous support for coverage of community issues programming ... point three WC piano Idea Stream comes from the George gun foundation\nIn Cleveland and

N. dot org but if you missed it will play some of the highlights for you and we'd love to hear your thoughts\nPerhaps you heard the first debate or you've just been formulating you\nEight six six five seven eight zero nine zero three and tell us what you think of Richard Cordray Mike DeWine this particular race or one of the issues that we just laid out a eight six six five seven eight zero nine zero three across the state sent emails to ask her why at W. CPS dot org tweet at sound of ideas\nAll right so Karen I'm gonna I'm gonna start with just a little bit of sound from the opening\nOr that the two candidates made when they came out first of all Mike DeWine he comes out talking about fracking which is a and the benefits of it and and exploration for for shale play he talked\nA very strong support of the second amendment at least in the last couple of years of both of these candidates do have some ground to make up with their bases when it comes to gun issues and and so I think that that's where you're seeing some of their answers I'd like to get a little more clarification from both of them on exactly how they got to the point that they are at now\nIn terms of what they think should be regulations on guns what sort of other issues that they think are involved in say school shootings and that\nSort of thing or number again eight six six five seven eight zero nine zero three let's move on to school funding ... decision another of the question and again all of these are questions that came from the audience in some way whether it was the folks who had sent in things to be a social media there was actually a mail a letter mailed to the moderator or there was read\nAs you don't hear about that very day\nShe pointed out the students in Marietta College are probably like what is that uh but yeah there were a lot of ways and so all of these things that we're addressing er or things that the public has brought up to these candidates one of them again was school funding and the inequity of school funding been ruled unconstitutional a number of times by the Supreme Court not been fixed\nAnd here is a first Mr DeWine on the ... decision or school funding and then we'll have rich Cordray\nGovernor I Will submit a budget for the state legislature that is focused on or force children as focused on her for school\nI've been pretty good throughout my career working people both parties to get things done I intend to do that and Richard Cordray\nOr something and I have pledged that we think that the ... decision was correct we think that the funding system remains unconstitutional\nThat the horizons of a child's future shouldn't see founded by the ZIP Code they happen to be born into nor says the ability of teachers in the classroom the founder by that either\nUh so what we need to do is rain end up failing charter schools get that money back into the classroom it cuts took it a billion dollars or more away from school districts across the state let's get that money back into the classroom\nWith we will work with the legislature to improve the school funding formula which is outdated and needs to be upgraded\n[noise] so what I didn't hear is that kind of wholesale change that many think would be necessary in order to provide equitable funding one is talking about renting a charter schools and working with the legislature Mike DeWine is saying a budget that focuses on the poorest districts not a whole lot of specifics\nWell the problem is that the governor can write a budget and it was after the legislature and they can completely change it and I think you know even John cases had some experience in this area where he has had his budget when it comes to school funding changed by lawmakers especially in wealthier districts\nHe has tried to make some changes in terms of\nGetting more money to these poor districts which you heard my wind talking about but then when it goes over the legislature those lawmakers who represent those districts want to make some changes and so I think when you talk about school funding unless you're ... you're trying to talk about really overall changing the all the whole formula and getting the legislature on board with that\nThen then there's really a little bit of limitation that the governor does have governors can line item veto and budgets\nBut you know there there does come a point where they are limited in terms of what they can actually do I think it's about the tone that they sat and the way that they would work with the legislature to try to get that formula and and make sure that they are really target\nCandidate Travis Irvine who uh tweeted during debate instead here's here here's a thought you said first of all I owe deserves better than petty bickering from Cordray into wine\nAnd then I think he got a pretty good shot and here he said I agree with Mike DeWine end Richard Cordray that they were both parable attorney general's this was travelers are binds us for essentially adjoining debate via Twitter\nA so interesting to see that in fact a there is a lawsuit filed by the libertarians in regards to a participation in the debates\nYeah I mean I Know that there is a lot of frustration on on the part of the minor party candidate I mean that they've they've actually had some\nRough way to go in Ohio in terms that they've been a regulated by state law they had to do some different things to try to get back on the ballot but it really does it it's a very small number of voters that they are actually reaching here very small number of voters who actually do cast ballots\nFor the libertarian candidate in the Green Party candidate I should mention the Green Party candidate a\n... signed the Green Party presidential candidate will actually be in Ohio Kent State in here in Columbus campaigning with the Green Party candidate Constance Goodell Newton but still again it it it really is a matter of\nYou know not that many people do vote for the candidate for governor and a lot of times the candidates for governor don't have full on\nProposals they don't have full on developed platforms that can really be compared to the platforms that the candidate a major party candidates have\nGot a couple of calls we're going to go into those in just a moment but I first want to talk about this question about political discourse and civility\nWhich was interesting because in that very discussion some might say there was sort of at a blame game and attacking and those types of things which do happen rich Cordray was essentially saying that's okay as long as you're telling the truth but here are their answers to the idea of political discourse\nOr with a rich Cordray is the answer on that and then like doing\nA lot of this poor town\nAnd divisiveness and hitting people against each other and blaming and scapegoating is coming out of Washington and I want to stand for something different here in Ohio I Want to stand for politics that we can respect and be proud of I Want to stand for being able to reach across the aisle\nAnd get things done and by the way over the course of his campaign I'm increasingly optimistic that we can reach across the aisle and I can work with the legislature on education reform I Believe I can work with them on infrastructure\nI Would like to work with him on criminal justice reform I'd like to have some path forward rather than the failed status quo were openly or deaths continue to rise year after year in Ohio with nothing being done effective to combat it\nAnd you're doing I'm the one on the stage that just had a long track record of getting things done making things happen my commitment to you and voters of Ohio\nI Will pull people together Democrat and Republican while I'm governor of the state of Ohio\nAll right there they are on that issue let's go to the phones now with Karen councilor and me and I'm like McIntyre and run out of a ... a calling us from Dayton welcome to the show\nYou what I was calling to [noise] I hear like doing in Richard Cordray ... but still I Would like to know how\nThey're going to get the money the deer Tony ... slow shrimp school education is the ... is is a key she is only like shame because in our schools are now and I want to know how they plan to pick them up\nReal thanks for the question so that as we just noted carrying there's talk about targeting the porous children they both have talked about early childhood education and and then uh other forms of preparing for the workforce\nNo that both wine and Cordray had been in touch with the school groups who have years of evidence showing\nThat the schools that have large numbers of economically disadvantaged kids have these achievement gaps those kids come in with a lot more challenges and that's where the wind talks about the early education in the intervention they're Cordray talks about a universal preschool\nThey're they're both talking about this but yeah you're exactly right the money is is an issue and and where does it come from and if it does if he goes to the schools where is it not going to\nAnd so that's a that's a good question that I Hope we get to in the next debate her I have an opportunity to now promote which is Monday I Will be moderating that debate along with a Jerry rev issue as an anchor at the CBS affiliate here in Columbus WB NF TV and Jackie bore church\nWho is now the statehouse bureau chief for the Cincinnati Enquirer and that's that's one of the kind of questions we asked I think\nThat's going to be next Monday and by the way I was going to promote that it nine twenty nine thirty but your job\nI buy admitted to it sorry\nBut yeah you'll be the moderator at that so what will that format be like it'll be not the town hall style but more you asking the questions you and the two others that you mentioned\nYeah this'll be the the debate last night was all questions from an audience and from social media\nAnd we're soliciting questions via social media through the Ohio debate commission and you go to the website Ohio debate commission dot org and you can actually have a link there to submit questions but also we will be me and those two other journalists and we were the only ones asking questions at that event\nAnd it'll be a roundtable literally as I understand it and discussion and uh so it it the format will be hopefully a little bit of give and take care but certainly at times format which\nI'll be in charge of to make sure that everybody gets a fair opportunity to to answer questions and to speak their mind\nAnd by the way if you want to shoot carrying a question or you can do that through the debate commission you can also send us an email here ... a W\nThat's the way I think people are going to be getting their voice heard what you want to know is what people want to know and that's what you ask the candidates are let's take a call or two more before we wrap this part of the conversation and cliff is calling in from Parma cliff Iran\nAllow their credit to remain open and not have it frozen because you mentioned like a mortgage or even a car loan or a student loan whatever that is not a decision that you're making on a whim you don't roll past one of the banks in town and say\nOh I think I'm going to go in and get a mortgage or hey I think I'm going to get a Carla decision that you make ahead of time so as you mentioned one of the good things about the law is that\nIf you request it to be thawed on line or by phone by law it must be thawed open within an hour so and I do it by mail it's within three days\nSo if I'm going to talk to a mortgage broker that afternoon conceivably that morning I should be able to call the credit reporting agency and say hey open this up because somebody's going to be\nWriting I mean the big thing is with these for people who do freeze their credit it's it's critical to put the pins you know the secret numbers away\nAnd put them in a safe place where you can find them if you need them because it takes a little bit of doing to retrieve your ... your pin if you lose it but if you have your pin\nYeah I don't necessarily know if I was planning on applying for a mortgage this afternoon that I Would wait until this morning to thought I might do it a day ahead of time and then leave it open for like a week because sometimes underwriters comeback but yeah it's that should not be that should not be a reason why somebody doesn't freeze their credit report\nIt's not hard to do by phone you mentioned you can do it with a letter as well going online to little more dicey because\nThese credit reporting agencies to want to sell you stuff they want to sell your fraud protection or some other identity theft monitoring and some alert system that ... that's now are looking for it sort of like with free credit reports you free rent free credit report and others don't think it's kind of a fake free credit report they call it bad in this case if you want to freeze it shouldn't be something that you have to pay for\nOh darling oh gosh no and I tell people I mean the the new system with with the new website says only been up here for a little over a week so it remains to be seen but it doesn't look like the credit bureaus\nThese hoops and you have to to dig deep into the automated menu to get to the point of actually freezing your file or an freezing your file it'll be interesting to see if they if they\nForce them to make it a little more transparent but you're absolutely right whether you call in or you go on line you should never ever provide a credit card number or a debit card number because it's free if if they're asking you to provide a payment form\nThen they're asking you to sign up for oh hey it's a free trial for identity theft monitoring for three months and then if you forget to\nTo cancel it's going to be Nineteen Ninety five a month or something like that I talked to people every single week who have gotten caught up in that mistakenly trying to do the right thing and freezer file and end up somehow with something paying for something that they didn't want\nTo do do that don't do that I Would also think good scammers would know that this was a new thing to other people are going to be trying to get on an access ah the way to freeze their accounts [noise] so do you think that this could be a thing or a scammer is calling people and saying hey we can freeze your account for you and you should never no one should be approaching you about it you should be approach\nOh gosh I mean I haven't heard of that yet but it wouldn't surprise me so sure I mean we have all kinds of fishing that goes on by phone by taxed by email where bad guys will call and or email and texting pretend to be\nYour bank your investment company or credit card company the IRS who hasn't gotten a call for back taxes or the FBI is coming and so I haven't heard of people posing as one of the credit bureaus but yeah you're absolutely right that's probably coming\nA Samantha send us an email she says I have a three year old son he obviously doesn't need to make any big purchases right now or Canada or should I freeze his credit until he's Seventeen or Eighteen to protect him no I don't know if it's but you have accredited three\nWell you you're the credit file basically as soon as you have a Social Security number really yes I'm so the answer to that question is yes and one of the provisions in the law\nWhich you know I froze the credit files for my adult son so you you don't have to it doesn't have to be a minor child\nBut you did it you can you do it for someone else like if you have an elderly relative or or your adult child you can you can take that responsibility is you know the pay and I guess\nYeah I mean clearly you would want to do it within family I mean I helped a friend do it with her consent but if you have the information and you can freeze the file for somebody I froze my husband's file\nAnd I know about that yes so you should get consent\nYeah but I have to have enough information to be able to do it and you know but yeah I I think it's a good idea to freeze children's files because in that case\nThe kid may not even know that there's a problem until all of a sudden one day he's applying for a student loan to get into college are applying for his first credit card and then boom it turns out that somebody in another country you know that's long gone has opened credit cards in\nThe person's name and it's a mess\nAnd as we've noted it's easy when that person does apply for the college loan or the credit card on on freezing out by that\nAbsolutely if you if if that's your excuse you're just being lazy\nOr Cathy writes your PT article said that no one said that one can't file state ... state taxes right when he tried to get a one cannot file you file state taxes so then it would have to be thought every year at tax time same thing through for federal taxes\nFederal they're not doing that yeah but she is correct\nWhat does that mean I read it and we I don't know\nWhat it is is um Ohio had started a couple three years back um that if you file on line your state taxes then they go through to make a church you said they're doing a good thing here and they will ask you\nSecurity questions that they access by getting a hold of your credit file so it might be like OK here's our fourth street names which of these streets have you lived down the path you know a records show that you have a car loan from ...\nSo I've seen your credit file so in the case of of Ohio each file if your file is frozen then you have two choices you can either saw your file or you can follow your return by mail\nOkay showed that applies er I also read McCollum so it was about this topic to FedEx needs to deliver a pack yeah I\nI haven't heard about ... trying to access people's credit files on the question though yeah it wasn't a question and I haven't heard of that but there are there are definitely lots of entities that are using these security questions to verify your identity it's called olive wallet so somebody steals your wallet\nAnd they've got your name your address your date of birth you know if you're not very bright you might be carrying around your Social Security card with you or if you have a Medicare card you know it's going to have your Social Security number on it\nAnd they would have a lot of information on you but they wouldn't necessarily know what the address of the house that you lived in Twenty years ago or they wouldn't necessarily know how much your ... your car payment is for example those are the kinds of things that come up and the security questions but the but the good thing is is with the thawing it's free now rent free and then in\n... in the case of the state in case of the state taxes if you get a a identity verification from the state then you can say oh I Need to follow my credit okay I'm going to do it um then this afternoon I'm going to come back and I'm an ... file my taxes are free to dying is free to re freezing as free as all free\nWill serve gene in Lakewood where the question we're near the end of this segment they always great information Jean what your question\nMy question is about the what is the candidate that you're talking about how do you get\nYou out so well not only do we forget our pin and sometimes we forget we even had a pin\nWhen you freeze your credit files or two of the three credit bureaus we'll give you a pin in the case of trans union you have to come up with your own the number digits bury it somewhere between like six and twelve is a Penn just a secret number that is required\nThat by mail then they will send it to you by male\nAnd a PIN by the way it personal identification number so I this was a number that they'll give you you got to keep it secure but it's what you need when you get on line and say this is me\nRight when one thing real quick too with with with what the data breaches and so forth it's not just about new accounts it's even more important than ever that people secure their existing account\nAnd so you know if somebody has all your information your Social Security number and all that kind of stuff they can try and tap into your existing bank accounts or existing credit card accounts it's super important to get um alerts set up with your banks with your credit cards with your investment companies\nSo that you're notified by text or by email or by phone if there's something unusual you set the parameters of what you want to be notified about\nWill have information about how to do all this on our website Idea Stream dot org slash ideas now click on today's show topic the top of it will be the debate topics that we had earlier today but in that\nAt the bottom of the page will be some information including links to your columns and in that you provide the phone numbers the mailing address is basically how to reach these credit agencies three the three biggies are the ones and you want to do it for all\nYes yeah you have to do it for a\nA let me get one last thought in here this is from pat says recently applied for the homestead exemption was advised that in order to get this I had to provide my entire Social Security number\nAt the same time I'd be required to sign a statement that I absolve the agency from any liability regarding the information provided presumably they need the information to confirm the tax return I provided them was actually filed with the state of Ohio\nSo is there has to be a better way to get the necessary information to the agencies that supposedly require it without either absolve ing them of any liability are getting better or even better giving them a better way to confirm the information they say they need that's a concern about giving up Social Security number I suppose and maybe we can talk about that you want to protect it", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas",
