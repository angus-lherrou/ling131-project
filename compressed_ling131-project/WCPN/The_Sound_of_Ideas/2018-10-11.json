fair shake created equal\nWhen we fall short on that promise when the system looks rigged we lose our faith and the basic premise that if we work hard and play by the rules will get ahead and that our children's lives will be better than our own\nThere's always been a gap between rich and poor though intention between a broadly based democracy and the power of wealthy elites today that gap as big as it's ever been and it's helped corrode faith in our basic institutions and belief in democratic solutions\nBut we've been here before in the Eighteen nineties the progressive movement a rose to challenge the power of the trust some the robber barons and in the Nineteen thirties amidst the despair of the great depression the new deal transformed the role of government and restored faith in democracy\nLater in the program we'll talk with political historian Lawrence Jay comes from the University of Minnesota about how and why inequality expanded late twentieth century and how that eats away at our institutions and we'll talk about what we learn from history and about democratic solutions\nBut we begin with Robert Dallek whose latest presidential biography is Franklin\nTo be with you and I want to begin with a quote from your prologue which is titled everything to fear you set the date march fourth Nineteen thirty three quote\nThe weeks leading up to Franklin Roosevelt induction into the White House where a nightmare as an unprecedented economic collapse it quieted the cheerleading about America's future that\nBusiness leaders in the press and politicians had made a hallmark of the Nineteen twenties optimism was in short supply voices of despair crowded out the promise of American Life\nIn January Ninety thirty three Calvin Coolidge the retired Republican president said in other periods of depression it has always been possible to see some things that were solid and upon which you could base hope but as I look about I now see nothing to give ground for hope nothing of man\nYou go on Herbert Hoover on his last day as president says we're in a pitiful position we are at the end of our strength and Robert Dallek is it fair to say that many were ready to pronounce American democracy offend you\nOr they were and in fact what you have to remember all of us have to remember is that this was a time when fascism Italy\nNot Susan in Germany and communism and Russia were competing for those Kennedy later put his hearts and minds\nAre those the feeling that democracy had reached its at\nThe end of the line and that these other ideologies these other systems government or one more appealing and of course that was the challenge for Franklin Roosevelt to address\nCould he or recreate faith than hope in a a a democratic institutions\nIs the great experiment appear to have run aground on the rocks right at the time that fascism in communism seemed to someone\nHow can people did he have specific ... here at the alternatives to propose\nWell it was not just the new deal but he said when he came to the Democratic convention in Nineteen thirty two we must be profits of a new order\nSuggesting that they were going to be reforms now changes in the way in which the uh the institutions of the country had function in the past than six million the recent past\nAnd that they needed to be a resurgence of hope that our institutions could endure could lash or could provide the kind of prosperity and the support\nAnd so that was an act of great political ... on his part because of course in that sense Pearl Harbor was a godsend to unite the country and bring it into the war as they are a solid failings of a support\nWell that does beg the question now how did he hold on to popular support when his critics on the right we're calling him a dictator and a communist and of course his policies did know succeed after some recovery early on FDR cut back on spending and there was another profound slump in the economy how didn't Roosevelt managed to keep Americans behind him\nWell in fact if they had not in World War two if the war had broken out Nineteen thirty nine\nI don't think Roosevelt would have been able to win a third term because in his second term when as you just described the country\nHad that recession and Roosevelt Nineteen thirty eight\nTried to defeat conservatives and the Democratic party in the primary elections specially across the south and he uh fell short in\nAll but one instance in fighting the conservatives in this party and I don't think he ever could have gotten the nomination again and certainly not the win a third term\nSo it was a war that really in a sense gave him the second opportunity and the country rallied around him\nGreat presidents of American history\nYou said earlier that Roosevelt did and and the depression relieved that in fact the war mobilization\nEnded the effort or your biography does not shy away from\nFranklin Roosevelt to mistakes or from his failure to take in Jewish refugees are from his failure to address racial issues more forcefully his decision to turn Japanese Americans in the second World War given all of that and more you still argue that his legacy is one of greatness\nWell it is because he was a brilliant leader in that he used radio to reach people in the grassroots so to speak\nAnd if you look at the polling data\nThroughout his presidency at least in the Gallup polls he never went below fifty percent we'll see what a contrast that is to the current incumbent who is never achieved fifty percent in his going on two years in the White House you see\nNow it speaks to Roosevelt ... ... as a politician and\nYes there were stumbles shortcomings they were limitations but again he reflected the public mood in the country when you know he didn't press the case energetically to rescue ... knowledge costs\nHe was reflecting the mood in the country\nWhich was very much anti immigration there was a lot of feeling that at the end of the war the country was going to get back into a recession or depression and that bringing in lots of immigrants would add to the unemployment rolls\nAnd so Roosevelt was very reluctant to challenge that outlook that sentiment you say and also\nThe medically killing Jews in concentration camps\nAnd something like sixty percent of the poll said they didn't believe that they thought it was wartime propaganda from the British which\nHad a drawing attention to World War one and so they were very skeptical of that\nI'm going to go back to something you said before and use it to look forward you alluded to the fact that FDR might well not want a third term and it was really World War two that pushed us into the creation of the liberal state the new deal state\nYes are you saying that we might not have had that state if it had not been for World War two\nWell it is certainly a loud Roseville preserve it\nBut I think that there were things that he had already put in place like Social Security you'll see an approval in Nineteen thirty five ... through the Wagner Act for a labor unions\nLegitimizing them and I don't think those would disappear it because you see once you get things like Social Security and more recently Medicare or look how difficult it's been\nTo overturn the Affordable CARE Act that the President Obama put in place she\nWell here's the next question then behind that\nWhat it changed how was American society how was American democracy different in Nineteen forty five than it had been in Nineteen thirty two what an FDR done or how it American Made such a profound change\nIt was it was a permanent change that this sort of notion that you were going to have some kind of ... involvement of the federal government\nIn the national economy in a providing a bedrock of support\nThese had become accepted propositions of the society\nAnd that they're not going to be repealed you know Social Security and Medicare I don't think they're ever going to go away as long as we have a democracy in the Democratic voting with a small D\nIn this country because these are institutions that strike resident in ... with people you see the new deal ... the American industrial system\nAnd lots of things that Lyndon Johnson did it to that and the Affordable CARE Act\nObama added to that\nAnd so people don't want that to go away yes there is a certain conservative impulse in the country and they still have faced it a a self help than the notion of ...\nPeople increasing their prosperity and having a better life that they had children these are still central propositions I think of American society and of the American the east coast\nSo I don't think this material will go away it was very much a change in the twentieth century than industrialized society could not continue to operate the way it had it a a nineteenth century economic and political culture\nRobert Dallek thank you very much\nMy pleasure Robert ... latest residential biography as Franklin

will the new court handle some of the country's most divisive issues listening to MORNING EDITION every weekday from NPR News [noise]\nThis is the democracy cast from truth politics and power and had a Cox Richardson and I'm Neal Conan by any measure the economic boom that followed\nThe second World War was to nominate here's one number gross domestic product two hundred twenty eight billion dollars in Nineteen forty five one point seven trillion in Nineteen Seventy five\nAs in any periods dumped it better than others but no group prospered more than the fight middle class this was the arrow in automobile production exploded America built the interstate highway system a housing boom created vast tracts of new homes in New suburbs that wants to norms gap between rich and poor tripled\nAnd the country they doubted democratic solutions and the great depression seemed to distant\nPolitical participation rose along with it\nOf Minnesota where he has to Walter and Joan Mondale chair for political studies at the Hubert Humphrey school\nA analysis I Do not think there's a magic bullet I think the most fundamental thing is to engage the majority of Americans when you have about half the country sitting out presidential elections\nAnd two thirds of the country are so sitting out midterm elections and even larger number sitting out local elections and then you've got the people in power making decisions that are really quite extreme\nThese are not the kind of Nineteen sixties or Nineteen seventies moderate politicians these are people once they're in power they're going for it\nAnd if they don't they know that they will be replaced then the next primary the sense of moderation response of this responsibility to the majority of Americans has disappeared\nAmong our political elites those who are in office or are closely connected to the process that elects officials there's been a major break down and the norms and the behavior of our political leaders today it's about go as far as you can as fast as you can\nVersus the pattern before the Nineteen seventies which was a bit more cautious and emphasize building coalitions and finding where the majority of Americans were at least on salient top of the agenda issues\nWhich brings us back full circle to where we started which is your correlation of people's faith in the government with the Democratic process\nAnd that brings us to a point where we have opinion polls that show the policies that would reduce inequality you you know higher minimum wage for example whole show those are broadly popular but those have been Norman's difficulties getting enacted ... is that the result of this polarization of the political parties that using\nAbsolutely I think one of the biggest signs one of the most significant virus\nAnd America we're in a dangerous on again and again on the major policies facing our country particularly so's affecting the economic well being of Americans you find majorities of Americans supporting those policies whether it's health care reform minimum wage\nAnd others and then you find a political class in Washington and our state government that are on moved there don't seem to be motivated to respond to what most Americans prefer instead they couched how\nTo the ideologically extreme\nActivist within their party they know if they don't follow the party line\nThat they will be replaced\nAnd that has become a tremendous corrupting influence\nThe path forward for beginning to address the deep and growing economic inequalities of America is well known we don't need a study for it the problem is that our political process is paralyzed and has been unable to respond to this transformation of our economy\nThat is driving the upper classes even higher and stagnating are pushing down just about everybody else that America\nI'm actually an optimistic person by nature but I'm also someone who follows\nResearch and data and I find this moment in American politics to be very sobering this is a hard period for me as someone who studies politics and public policy to be optimistic we're really at each other's throats\nBut here's something that I find interesting which is when you leave Washington or state capitals and you go out and you spend time with people in the country\nThere's some things that are developing that I find quite interesting I see a lot of ...\nI see a lot of communities coming together and looking for solutions because they know they can't trust Washington or state capitals\nI'm also encourage that even over these policies that are so polarized like health reform we see movement if you look carefully\nI've been doing a study with a colleague at Cornell University Suzanne Mettler and we've been tracking a group of Americans since twenty ten when the Affordable CARE Act was passed\nAnd when we started it was what you'd expect our group of Americans representative of the country were very divided along party lines\nBut now that we're moving into the eighth or ninth year of the four double CARE Act we're starting to see real movement\nWhere Republicans would favor repeal are now saying well maybe this is not such a bad idea\nLet's see if we can improve it we're starting to see greater support\nFor some of the very concrete provisions like protections against preexisting condition exclusions or expanded Medicaid coverage or subsidies or benefits for seniors and as some of those partisan divisions of B. gun to break down\nWe're also starting to see an uptick in political advocacy that sense that the government response to me and said I've got the capacity\nTo influence the government to me that's a hopeful sign and it goes against the grain of our political process the question is will our elected leaders listen\nThank you very much for being with us here today Larry yeah pleasure this is Lawrence Jacobs at the University of Minnesota his books include class war what Americans really think about economic inequality which he wrote with Benjamin page\nI Wonder whether what some see as the golden age of the post war boom or is that the American ... a prosperous society where many people have opportunities or is that an anomaly and the kind of inequality we saw in the Nineteen twenties or today that more than\nYou know Neal I think we actually go back and forth between the two\nWe have periods in American history where people really focus on equality of opportunity and the gap between the rich and the poor tends to get a lot smaller than it does at other times and then there's the policies that you need to put in place to guarantee equality of opportunity\nCosts money they cost tax dollars and they have in the ability of people at the top of society to do whatever they want and they start to get angry about that and they fuel a backlash against that kind of legislation\nSo you have after periods when you have an expansion of equality of opportunity saying the Eighteen sixties or in the progressive era or in the Nineteen fifties you get a backlash against that that tends to be racist and it tends to be anti immigrant\nIt off in his anti female and you get the argument that any kind of equality of opportunity any kind of government attempts to guarantee equality of opportunity\nCosts too much money they cost too much tax dollars and therefore are infringing on the liberty of people with money\nAnd you get as I say this Xena phobic and racist backlash that tends to make sure that money concentrates increasingly at the top of society until you get to a place as we were in the Eighteen fifties or the Eighteen nineties or the Nineteen twenties or the present\nWhere there's way too much money at the very top and not enough in the next Ninety nine percent and you have to have a revolution in the system and I don't mean literally a revolution as in guns in the streets but people's minds have to change and the governmental system has to change and it does it's happened cyclical e throughout our history well let's go\nThe Constitution's now obviously there were enormous opportunities where the continent are behind you are but the\nShe fairness as a goal\nSo when the phone to talk about the revolution they're not actually talking about the fighting there talking about the revolution in men's mines that takes place before it to them the fighting was actually sort of not exactly the hottest sold but sort of uh\nThe way you cemented the change in ideas that had happened before the fighting broke out so when you talk about the revolution and what they were really thinking about was the way people thought about government\nAnd what that meant was the acceptance of colonial's at the time they're not Americans yet but the acceptance of colonial's of the idea\nThat all men are created equal and of course you got to put fences around that they meant white men they tended to mean ... men of property they certainly didn't include women but the concept that all people had equal natural rights was indeed revolutionary\nAnd it was not clear that that kind of a government the idea that people should have a say in their own government in their own and the rules under which they lived it was not at all clear that that was actually workable that this was gonna actually turned into a country that\nCould survive so in the Seventeen nineties when they're first hashing out what the world will look like or what America will look like under the constitution people are really really worried about the rise of monarchy\nThey're really worried about anarchy and they're trying to somehow thread the needle between those two things and what they care about\nIn that period is less fairness that word and more the idea of equality before the law they don't expect equality of outcome they're perfectly fine with there being poor people in rich people and people who don't do well and people who get poor land and people who ship sink and all that sort of thing\nGenerous support for coverage of community issues programming ... point three WC piano Idea Stream comes from the George gun foundation advance\nIn

connected capability\nDigital is Asian um you've got to put it into which box and if you look all the way to devices my earlier example where a refrigerator talks to the grid now you're talking about in the city of Cleveland you know several million a refrigeration devices each one costing the thousand dollars apiece\nSo that question well it's a permanent the issue is how do we build a road map that we get both the utility in this case first energy's a major player in this\nConsumer all participating in the road map that brings us to what will be the future of a digital grid\nTodd mentioned it being a public works project is it something the intern in your view in terms of getting the grid hitter of lead to this point is it something rate payers will be a will be covering or is it something that needs a public a different kind of public investment\nI think you have a combination of both rate payers are obviously as digital was Asian rules out there a major component are and how that investment is returned in lower operating costs while there is an investment there should be a return\nBut you also see a cities across the country in Cleveland is one of them that is looking at it from a city perspective where does their infrastructure and strategy go so you've got them as a players as well\nRight last call here is Greg in colon would we have just a couple of minutes left

of his classmates survive by yelling at them to run when Adam Lanza stopped to reload more than half a dozen children did and they lived as a result\nNow Jesse's mother is working to help other children so that they may never faced the terror her son did where the pain she lives with today scarlet Lewis will be in Akron tonight at Glover school to discuss the Jesse Lewis choose love movement and it's focused on social and emotional learning also known as s E L\nIts focus is on teaching children how to manage their emotions develop empathy and foster positive relationships and she contends that if Lanza had benefitted from social emotional learning\nHe likely wouldn't have grown up to be a mass murderer scarlet Lewis founder of the Jesse Lewis choose love movement joins me now in Studio good to have you with us thank you Mike and thank you for being here and I know you're\nYou have a world when traveling schedule including this speech the night so I appreciate you making time for ... thank you for having me spread the message if you want to join our conversation if you've got some questions for scarlet if you want to talk about the idea of social emotional learning as we\nAh went through that this morning feel free to call us at eight six six five seven eight zero nine zero three you can email us ... a WPN dot org you can tweet at us at sound of ideas [noise]\nWe've got an election going on in Ohio and across the country in the midterms are at this time and we've been asking a lot of the candidates what would you do to make schools safer an awful lot well here is that there should be a mental health counselor in the school or there should be a school resource officer who was armed and knows who the students are were metal detectors\nAll of these ideas because everyone is obviously concerned about keeping children safe\nYou say social emotional learning might Trump all of those things tell me why I think from ...\nEvery school shooting up kind of behind the times uh but we think about active shooter protocol single point entries are arming or not arming school resource officers um and those are all external\nGun laws yeah I don't really get that old got ... and those are all external safety\nMeasures very important of course but none of that addresses the cause of why a student would want to come back to the school harm themselves or someone else\nOn in in my mind social emotional learning directly relates to the cause by teaching kids\nHow to have healthy relationships meaningful connections how to identify label manage and express emotions skills and tools for resilience how to manage conflicts kids that had these skills and tools and by the way they have to be taught were not born with the skills and tools\nThey have to be taught kids with the skills and tools will not want to harm on another it makes common sense but we also have researched back that up\nSo how often when you talk about this do you get people to say okay that's a bunch of combine a touchy feely stuff and we need to get down to brass tacks what are you sitting do you hear that and what do you say when when that the the response\nActually I don't hear that because I think what I'm saying makes a lot of common sense and I think what we've done to date isn't working\nSo when you talk about staff to back it up but I guess that's what I was driving up because when you have a conversation where you say perhaps it's about how we're dealing with our children the answer might be nope we've got a hard target and and ... will show you what the target as hard and\nYou know it's less likely that somebody could get in or something where you at stats on your end to that says\nA ... if you do this kind of social emotional learning it works so can you tell me a little bit about what this means of not just about um having happier\nSituation that happened it's in your\nFuture so it's and it's not just about having safe schools when you look at the research and by the way there decades of research behind social and emotional learning you see that ah kids that have social emotional learning in classrooms have first of all off the bat first off the bat better grades and test scores\nHigher attendance higher graduation rates\nLess stress and anxiety less behavioral issues better classroom in school climate less bullying it's actually a proactive preventative way to address bullying that is statistically effective\nAnd they have research that have followed kids from kindergarten all the way into adulthood and they found reduced substance abuse reduced mental illness of all kinds reduced anger and incarceration even reduce divorce rates and so I always say with that one\nSee I could have benefited from it as well because what I realized when I was forty four and I started researching I'm being part of the solution and what that would look like\nRealized you know what I really don't have a lot of these skills and tools because I wasn't taught them I had learned them as an adult over the past five and a half years in my life is exponentially better\n[noise] who does the teaching of this type of thing as a regular classroom teacher who's going through algebra and all the other day at work or even younger just regular math and science and in English or they also attracted to teach this thing or is there a specialist at would come in\nIt's not it ... it could be all of the above anyone can teach it and actually it it should be when it's taught", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "city":
