we go to doctors and who\nBuy medicine and who checked in and out of hospitals have been known as patients but somewhere along the line we patient started to be called consumers a term that suggests things like choice and competition and value for money and if we are consumers of health care then who would know best how to provide to these consumers\nWell in the last year we've seen a sudden surge of consumer oriented companies trying to figure out how to get into health care in a big way like Amazon partnering with a bank and with Warren Buffet with plans to figure out\nTheir own healthcare system for their combined million plus employees like CBS the pharmacy buying at the insurance company\nThey say they know consumers they no data and they know how to deliver value\nAre

where's that come from\nSo like almost every physician I now when I was clinically practicing I was frustrated on a daily basis that the system kept me from being able to do what I thought what's best for patients\nIs for us the base I'm John Donvan we have for debaters two teams of two fighting it out over this resolution\nRetail alliances not Washington will save the U.S health care system you've heard the first to opening statements and then on to the third to debate for the resolution Dr ... co founder and chief health officer asked collective health ladies ... advantages [noise]\n\nKnew healthcare could be so complicated so explain presidents from last year he continued let it be a failure will blame it on the Democrats\nWashington cannot save our healthcare system Washington responds more to the interests of pharmaceutical companies big health insurers and hospitals system and it does all of us who are accessing care\nHospital payments since two thousand up sixty percent pharmaceutical cost up sixty nine percent\nOf the Democratic administration that took affordability out of the Affordable CARE Act and gave a multi year multi billion dollar concession to big insurers so that they would support the bill\nIt was a Republican administration who gave up Medicare's ability to negotiate drug prices for seniors the result insulin which cost twenty dollars a few years ago for a senior now cost that senior seven hundred dollars\nKeep in mind American employers are paying eighty eight percent a private health insurance costs eighty eight percent\nPaying for that proton beam machine the hospital didn't really need because there was a very suitable one right next door paying for that fancy new way\nAnd this cost comes back into our Medicare costs because now the federal government also has to keep these hospital the flow who have built these institutions to get more revenue from the private sector because they\nSays that he and his fellow CEOs are attacking the hungry for him that it's eating at the American economy they mean it recognizing that we can move from a system of health care that is sponsored by employers\nTo one that has driven by them that goal toward the outcomes that focuses on improving the health and wellness of our people and the bottom line of our economy\nThere's another beacon of hope to that I see retail\nLook at the costs of lasik eye surgery down thirty percent over the last ten years nothing else in health care decreases in ...\nAt technologies improve the costs have come down and all we the the inverse in health care even specialty surgery is look at the surgery center of Oklahoma where you can get on Google and you get a price list for a new replacement and it's twenty percent of the cost of the competing institution\nWho will have the incentive to reshape pharmaceutical distribution of care delivery and move out of a world of secret negotiations where the winner negotiate the best deal into a world where we are rewarding the best service\nOver the last two years Washington has moved to defund the children's health insurance program defund Planned Parenthood the house passed a bill that seeks to remove one point five trillion dollars for Medicaid and five hundred billion dollars from Medicare\nA court system that is set on taking away a woman's right to choose Washington is coordinating an assault on the health of women\nChildren the elderly and the poor we have an American economy and a set of incentives in retail and employer enterprises that are looking to take it back to prove that America can save the healthcare system\n[noise] like you're right in front me [noise]\nOur final speaker will be arguing against the motion retail alliance was not Washington will save the U.S health care system founder and CEO of day health strategy\nSome of the most innovative lifesaving treatments in the world but for the twenty eight million uninsured Americans those treatments are completely out of reach and for the eighty two million Americans who have health insurance but can barely afford\nTheir differing care and not getting the care they need which actually puts their lives at risk it's actually the American workers who are fueling our economy\nIt's the delivery drivers who bring Amazon packages to your door and other people and the gig economy which happens to be one of the biggest growing segments in our economy\nThey don't have health insurance and their only option for health care is to either across their fingers or show up in the ER\nWe're lagging way behind comparable countries we lagged behind and other measures you've heard the other debaters talk about this cost quality and access in fact we actually spend twice as much in this country and we get half the results\nIf you want to address cost quality and access for all than retail is not enough\nWe spend Eighteen percent of our GDP on healthcare other country spent ten percent\nIf you go to CBS\nThey can provide you with some convenience and that's great but that's not actually addressing the major cost drivers in our system if\nWe look at quality measures things like hospital admissions from preventable disease or life expectancy we lagged behind other countries it's frankly kind of embarrassing to improve the quality measures we really need to invest outside of health care into the social determinants of health\nRetail alliances are for profit they leave people out and they don't have the scale\nA retailers bottom line is really not societies bottom line they are not oriented towards doing the common good they need paying customers they take a short term view they have to their priority as their shareholders not what's good for society\nDriver in between gigs retailers don't really see you as a money making opportunity if we turn to employers they insure less than half of our population the scale of the employers who can actually drive change is\nVery small and when you look at the alliances like Amazon Berkshire Hathaway taping Morgan they only cover a tiny fraction a million\nIn fact it's government that has that scale government is playing an increasingly large role in the role of hair both for Medicare and Medicaid and if we look at that silver tsunami that's coming out of that is only going to grow\nRetail alliances are not enough Washington actually has to be part of the solution\nWhen you look at the health care industry is unique it's actually full of market failures like monopolies short term incentives all kinds of things that the private sector won't solve on its own we need Washington at the table we have to have retail employers they're necessary but they're not sufficient\nOther developed nations had actually made that successful they provide overwhelming prove that this can happen\nWe don't need scattershot solutions we need a better functioning system\n[noise] round one of the word us debate where a resolution\nIs retail answers not Washington will save us health care system\nNow we move on to round to end in round two the debaters addressed one another directly they also took questions for me and from you our audience here at the Mayo transform conference or the resolution again returned alliances not Washington will save the U.S health care system\nWe have to debaters arguing in support of this motion Roger ... New Jersey and Greg Slager arguing that Washington is broken that the U.S into many categories is last last last with the government does not know how to surf consumers\nThat the retailers know how to scale that they have multiple ways to reach\nAnd to reward the best service and do so with transparency and their answer to that is the American employer with an emphasis on the retail sector\nThe team arguing against the motion leads to below ... and Rosemary day there say they are not arguing that Washington is the sole solution but they are definitely saying they're going to a clinic such as Wal Mart's may be convenient but it's just not the same thing as going to the doctor they questioned the motives of these retailers\nThey say that they cannot scale the kind of health care that needs to be delivered system why does not just primary care but really the big big problems and they don't see these companies getting interested in that\nA lot of area of disagreement and I want to work through some of it but I Want to start to you Greg Slager you're both of your opponents argued that retail companies\nUltimate loyalty is to shareholders not to the health of their employees or the health of their customers is just the fact of life\nGives the lie to the whole notion that we should be trusting them to take on this job what's your response to that\nFirst off I think that if\nYou're lowering your healthcare costs for employers so you can buy more goods she called the junk there is a big portion of America that doesn't think it's junk and its survival for them I think that that's important because what you've done as you gave them choice you've reduce health care costs which is not a choice and you gave them choice CBS\nTook cigarettes out of their store two billion dollars in sales\nGone overnight because they want to be viewed as a health provider they are building trust they're becoming more mission based not sick care this health care this is helping them live healthier lives this is helping them with nutrition this is keeping them ... those are the big problems I mean you look at diabetes and\nI'm John Donvan this is intelligent squared us and we're in the middle around two and debating this topic will retail alliances not Washington said the U.S health care system just before the break Dr ... was making the point that employer alliances are the answer to the problem of healthcare costs\nThat's what these employer alliances are all about getting employers to work directly that provider for things and finally in their their control\nAt large employers are only a third of all employed Americans my family owns a John Deere dealership outside of Houston, Texas my mother who manages the benefits doesn't have the time began with or knowledge to not go through an intermediary\nTo help them find good health care for their a couple of dozen employees\nCompletely different game for the folks who worked for small business\nAnd I would add that insurers has been that intermediary and they have often been accused of having a lot of power maybe sometimes too much in certain markets\nAnd yet they struggle when they go up against some of the large provider systems that have been increasingly consolidating and assembling their market power and almost in a sense being able to set prices okay so I Wonder where can an employer alliance\nIt feels a little like David and Goliath to me\nI Want to let the other side respond and then I Want to come to your questions which would you would like to respond to a great guy but I Would to address that issue and those are good points that you're\nMaking here too but when you're thinking about saving you're thinking about the future not the past\nAnd when I think about you know innovation to companies and and consumer product comes in what they're bringing to the table here too are these demand aggregation platforms and the whole purpose of these we've seen them disrupt other industries they've disrupt travel the truck media destructive retail sixty percent of purchases are made through a\nAggregation platform on line from a retail perspective and we're building those things to try to drive similar disruption aggregating employees demand will encourage provider supplier platform involvement too and it's a virtuous cycle we've seen it happen many many times this is where technology can help\nIt's a virtuous cycle the more employers that come on board than these alliances and they're small and and your family's business I could get on a platform that could have care\nAnd supplies and whatnot delivered more price competitive we're more transparency can really change I I I huh\nI live here in Rochester I function as an emergency doc my question was what you think the government and retailers could do for the homeless and others who currently are being underserved what about the homeless people\nWould ... would like to go first from Virginia or\nI'd like to hear from them\nWe totally agree that government has a role in here too and I think one place where we feel in this country that other countries do a much better job of is in our social networks and creating those safety nets the government and retail should work together and figure something out like that but I really do think that social terrorists really something that we really need to invest in\nI work as a physician I used to working homeless clinics in San Francisco a city that is\nPlayed by us and Mexican homeless problem Medicare and Medicaid are great negotiators but you know if I'm running a homeless clinic which I've done in the past what do I prefer to pay Medicare and Medicaid prices for a band aid and Tylenol or what I prefer to pay Amazon prices\nThe changing the distribution that we can have is going to be meaningful and it's going to allow us to provide better care for the poor\nAnd it's going to free us up to expand Medicaid government has a very important role to play in the future of our system our point is a government isn't going to save our system but rather retailers an employer alliances in our drive costs down and the homeless will benefit from that as well the weakest of all Americans\nFrom the other side response to that question\nSo I read that they're still going to be the forgotten people until they actually have some money to put on the table\nGovernment needs to play that role to not forget about the ... folks who are homeless and our country does very poorly relative to others in terms of our investment in social services so that's something that we have to have the collective well to do retailers can partner in that I think they're innovative programs\nLike the idea of a trickle down health care benefits to the homeless employers and ...\nAn access to the federally qualified health center\nWhich prides fantastic primary care and mental health benefit to a lot of American\n[noise] if you could tell us your name ... thank you my name is Spencer merchant from Minneapolis, Minnesota I worked for the insurance side how are the retail agency's going to transform clinical care who spoke and mostly about price points and negotiation and\nWhat does this future really look like nuts and bolts sense yeah a great going to take that\nIt's going to involve the more money is going into consulting rooms and expanding the care facilities and these large retailers some of these entities I mean there are food deserts and there are a pharmacy does too but some of these retailers they're effectively the community centers they know all the people in the neighborhood they come in\nWalmart has a hundred and fifty million visitors to their stores every year you know the engagement that they have with the folks in their community and I think it's going to help them\nIn terms of preventable care I think the health care as opposed to secure I think it's going to stop ER admissions to they've got a built in advantages I mean because people are going there that they got the convenience they got the access there also subsidize as I mentioned I mean their buildings are subsidized so it can continue to Dr Laura ... throughout the continue\nTo get the other side to respond on that plane and the reason in my own reporting around the country there are parts of the country I now go to where\nThe downtown small downtown is gone because Wal Mart came to town you know at Walmart replaced at Walmart is the village square there is a sense of community there and so your opponents are arguing that that sense of community has a real tangible positive thing to be taken into account in this debate I just wanted to see what your responses to that\nSo it's hard for me to judge whether Wal Mart really is creating a sense of community compared to like that mom and pop pharmacy where they knew you over the long term you know maybe in some spots that is true but I really see Wal Mart\nThere unlike what we talk about with a federally qualified health center or a doctor who has a long term relationship with their patients so I Do think it's different I Want to go to a question here\nHi I'm ... Barton I'm from the University of Wisconsin Madison and we've spoken a little bit about how you need money to access the system as it exists today\nBut what about the incentive that retail has to actually create a future where you then have money to participate in retail in a way that I Want to\n... for you seeing that dynamic as an argument to support the foresight or as a challenge to the far side for both sides okay okay well let's take the reason I asked the question is I thought I actually heard that's the only reason that Wal Mart is interested in bringing down health care costs so that you would have more money to spend on\nOther products and Wal Mart you you didn't actually argue whether that's a good thing or a bad thing but a phenomena but I Want to take it to the other side first\nThe dynamic of these retailers I think having a motive or or just an effective putting more spending money in people's pockets because their health care costs have gone to\nThis I mentioned I think that's a good thing because what you've done as you move something that was not by choice to something that is by choice something that's a burden to something that's an opportunity\nTo think about those families and what they need to know their life do they need to pay more for health care or more for other than the food and the central to help the social determinants of health the other impacts of health outside of just visiting the health system\nSo we so why is that a bad thing if they drive down the costs and you can buy more stuff at Wal Mart wires and\nThere's two points first being okay they might free up a little bit of your disposable income by changing how do you buy a drug or get a flu shot or a sore throat does it that's a fantastic thing\nBut if they're really going to transform the system you're going to have to trust a retailer to partner with you on something like cancer care\nNot go directly to retail is the only solution that can free at more of our disposable income from health care um it may not be mine necessary political stance that a lot of people are arguing that Medicare for all would do that for the average American so I think there are myriad ways we can get there\nOkay I Would love to continue with the question answer section but we're out of time that concludes round two of this intelligence squared us debate where\nOur resolution is retail alliances\nNot walk will save us health care system and now we move\nOn to round three where each of the debaters makes a closing statement first break Slager senior partner and global health transaction leader\nAt Ernst and young is a follow on to that question actually so I mean I just want you to imagine everybody knows and Irene Irene is fifty six years old she lives with her husband she's on fixed income she's got diabetes\nAnd she's struggling with high blood pressure she goes to a retailer once or twice a week with her husband to buy products that she typically buys that the retailer knows who it's intimate relationship and engagement and through using data analytics while she's in she goes to the pharmacy she refills a script she buys some insulin strips\nShe stops to get her blood pressure tested to compare it to her home result she's got one at home and it's been spiking a bit so she goes into Walmart for free she gets her her blood pressure

N. dot org is the address or tweet at sound of ideas will be posting all of the candidate interviews by race and Idea Stream dot org slash election twenty Eighteen\nWe ask each other candidates to begin with the elevator pitch briefly why they are the person for the job here's my conversation with Democrat Richard Cordray starting with his answer to that very basic question\nAs governor I Will work to put money back in the pockets of middle class Ohioans are that's what I've done throughout my time in public service or we will reduce health care costs in Ohio we will improve education training to give people a better shot in the workplace and we will spread opportunity across the state\nBut my opponent Mike DeWine on his first day in office as attorney general filed a lawsuit to take healthcare away from Ohio and especially the all important protections for people with a preexisting condition\nHe found another lawsuit to make sure that people could not get overtime pay when they aren't at three hundred and twenty\nOhio and we need to bolster and strengthen our middle class and working class here in the state\nYou had a job with the consumer financial Protection Bureau the Federal Bureau there and left that to come to Ohio to run for governor what was the thinking behind that\nWell I only had a few months left in that term and I felt that the governor's race here was really important in terms of setting a tone in direction for the state\nAnd for this country are and you know I I look in and see a policies where they want to double down on more tax cuts for the rich that's part of the economic program ... trying to sell\nOne thing many experts say would be great for a child's future is a high quality preschool experience agreed what do you think about the idea of universal pre K\nUh you're you're totally on the money on that and some of our cities around the state in Cuyahoga County have been pressing forward in this direction\nAnd I said we need to scale that up state wide we can build on what dating in Cincinnati\nIn Cuyahoga County or doing actually this is an area of agreement between the two campaigns we both agree that there needs to be more effort on early childhood learning that ages zero through five are really crucial the talking K. through twelve starts almost too late for a lot of kids they get way behind the eight ball\nThey enter kindergarten not ready to learn they come out of a high school not ready for the workforce there is a direct correlation there are both of us are have said we will put more money into that and I think that gives me confidence the legislature will step up and help us on this one I'm governor\nSo that's one end of education you have another and being the high cost of higher education most surveys indicate that Ohio is among the highest cost and the country so we are as governor how can you change that\nAre we we let this get away from us in Ohio and it's a bad sign for our future were forty fifth in the nation and college affordability\nAnd now there's a number of things we can do or we can build on our community college programs uh either two year degrees which are very sufficient for a lot of people to compete in the workplace and get the skills they need or access in community college for two years toward a four year degree two plus two\nWas we can help families optimize student federal student loans and federal grants\nWhen a family faces this decision they it's brand new to them they don't really know what they're doing\nIf they have good guidance counselors in the high school they can help but you know if it's a mix there and we need to think about from the state how we can more strategically\nA help families address that issue and know exactly with eyes open what the costs will be what the payments will be at the end ah and whether this education in this degree is the right one or whether some other one is the right one\nPeople need to be able to make good decisions in the state can help help people situate and then make the best decision for themselves\nA quick break and then more from Democrat Richard Cordray candidate for Ohio governor later we'll hear from the Green Party candidate Constance all new to this is the sound of ideas I Mike McIntyre we'll be right back [noise]\n\nHas thoughts on today's show send an email to Sai ...

dot com turning your obstacles into opportunities [noise]\nWelcome back to the sound of ideas from Ninety point three I'm Mike McIntyre but X. two weeks we're bringing you interviews we conducted with candidates and major races in Ohio today two of the candidates for governor in a bit we'll hear from Green Party candidate constants Goodell Newton now we continue our conversation with Democrat Richard Cordray\nWe're going to move into gun issues but here's a sort of a bridge question because it involves education as well do you support or oppose the call to arm teachers\nI think we should have school resource officers in the schools some districts are going that direction that has not been part of my plans are I think the school resource officers we had them in our high school that my children attended and graduated from\nAnd it worked well they knew the student body they knew who was going in and out they can monitor what was coming in and out everybody felt pretty safe and it was a pretty good way to do it uh that that's been my approach around Ohio so no on arming teachers I'd I'd that's not part of my plan\nSupport from the IRA has been seen as a bellwether for some voters and elections because uh it indicates a view on obviously got rights and gun control what's your position on the Radio Welcome of funding for ... would you welcome funding for any support\nInternet well Mike DeWine has been courting the n._r._a. or and he will have their support I Believe in the selection but\nUh you know what I had said is we need to have a better approach a on the mass shootings and making sure we keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill and domestic violence of users or we need to strengthen the background check system in the states\nOn these issues so I I think that we need to change as governor I Will fight for that change but we haven't had it and I think Mike DeWine is doubling down on the status quo\nAnd the debate that you had with Mr to wind the issue of abortion came up and the two of you couldn't but couldn't have been more\nDiametrically opposed on that the question about the heartbeat bill which is something would ban abortion wants a fetal heartbeat is detected was asked misread wind studied sign it you said that you wouldn't\nUh he also talked about the fact that he is pro life and that he would talk about providing services for pregnant women that that's something that the that the government would have an obligation to do how do you defer with him on this whole issue and why do you think that distinguishing difference makes a difference to voters\nYet look people have principled views on this issue and I respect that ... position on a woman's right to choose is so extreme he has no exceptions for rape or incest so a Thirteen year old girl\nHer uncle could rape her and impregnated her and she is going to be forced to take care of that child to term that is a very extreme position and the heartbeat bill says that after about six weeks there would be no abortions in the state of Ohio\nNumber of women wouldn't even know for sure if they're pregnant at six weeks you know that that is an awful stampede on a woman when she's trying to cope with difficult choices\nI think we need to respect a woman's right to make that decision with her family and her doctor or we should be respecting that in Ohio he and I are fundamentally different on this I think he said and extend a dramatic extreme on this and he's out of step with Ohio voters\nHow would you accomplish providing more choice and the issues you talked about what the legislature that you have\nWell first of all I think we should refund Planned Parenthood they defunded Planned Parenthood and ...\nHe bears responsibility\nA lot of things that you mentioned here things are going to cost a lot of money going out to the opioid crisis fixing the issues on Lake Erie and working with farmers are would be harmed financially perhaps by some of the sexes I think a lot of people here\nWith that yes I think that um opioid addiction and drug addiction is a health care issue and should be treated as a health care issue not a criminal issue\nThe Ohio Green Party secured for years about access falling a fight a couple of years back um can you win the votes is time to maintain met\nMore John yes I think so so my predecessor and neater Rios did get three point three percent in her governor's election and roughly a hundred thousand votes yeah and the Green Party since then has seen a lot of gross\nWe have had about Seventy five percent growth since twenty sixteen and um we have a pretty good ground game we're going all over Ohio meeting people from\nUm the the larger cities and in rural areas so we've been out to Lima in Canton and the ... valley\nAnd uh we've seen a lot of growth and enthusiasm this year so I really feel that um we've maintained our strengths and will continue to grow\nWe have right now the governor and legislature being dominated by the Republican Party is it your belief that they're so entrenched they've kind of started to deal with what's important to the party in forgotten the will of the people\nWell yes and I would say that that is kind of true in politics across the board I think that we see politicians\nI'm taking corporate donations and really acting in the corporate interests instead of in the interest of the people there is a lot of political polarization and I think that this in the end it's really not beneficial for the people that politicians are supposed to be representing\nSome of the issues and want to get to certainly education it's been more than Twenty years in the Ohio Supreme Court delivered the first of several rulings on the rural school funding face at the state continues to rely heavily on property taxes to pay for education what as governor would you do to bring Ohio school funding in line with the court decision um\nWere unconstitutionally and as a result of\nOur unconstitutional school funding model so rather than basing school funding off of property taxes we want to take a look at the local government funding formula and adjust that formula so that local governments have adequate funding to fund their schools\nSo um we do a support public schools and one every child to have a good public school education in the Green Party we also support a good quality free public education from preschool to college\nPreschool you want universal preschool which has been a hard topic ...\nAh yeah I think that some things that will get kids off to an early start with literacy so that's very important and it also helps parents um you know as as a woman and a female candidate I Want women to have it all I Want women to have\nA great career and a great education and a family so this is something that will allow women to um\nTo have the child care and the early childhood education that they need so they can continue in college and in their career\nThere is a skills gap in Ohio some people for schools some people don't finish school we have a lot of jobs that require more than what the workers have at the same time where people are looking for jobs that just aren't there how in the governor's chair would you hope to close that gap [noise]\nUm I Do think that vocational training is an important part of\nWhat should be our high school curriculum so I think that vocational training on having an emphasis and um you know having mentor in a four students from high school on would be a good way to uh get the training that we need\nYou mentioned water quality earlier here in northeast Ohio of course we're worried about Lake Erie and concerns or Toledo the roots\nWould you as governor continue to push forward to protect water\nUm yes I think uh you know that is an important environmental concern\nAnd um my running mate has a lot of experience in environmental issues and farming issues so this is something that I think we need to work with farmers so that we can find the solutions to the runoff we want to promote organic farming practices\nAnd um work work with farmers to come up with some of those solutions\nIt's one of the things you know we always expected me to push through the cleaner environment it's one of the things that you stand on Ohio on the right track when we think about you mentioned fracking earlier and we think about all will blooms are we in need of more environmental pushers from the legislature from ago was\nYeah you know right now the mission of the Ohio Department of natural resources really seems to be focused on natural resource management for profit and we see the Odierno are getting funded per barrel of fracking frack waste that we accept into our state so I Would like to um [noise]\nUh see the OD on our have a mission that is more focused on conservation and um you know to strengthen our agencies that protects the environment though UPA uh for example but\nUm I Do think that we need to do more I think that we should um begin a transition to all renewable energy with an emphasis on wind and solar and\nWind and solar manufacturing can be a great boon to our state with jobs in the economy\nUm wind turbine manufacturing is one of the the largest quickest growing industries and I think that Ohio can be a leader in green energy we can I'm really have an economic base through green energy I'm In our state and become a leader in that regard\nCutting local government for knows we shifting the tax burden to cities to school districts are they right would you make a change\nUm yes I Would definitely change that right now we see local governments paying paying in but not getting a money back from that and\nWe also see a lot of large out of state corporations coming into our state exploiting workers exploiting our\nOur tax system and exploiting the lay on for a profit\nI think some of those tax abatements a need to be stopped so that we have that money for educational system and our health care system and we need to have a greater privilege an emphasis on small locally owned and green businesses in Ohio\nOne of the companies that has come in and recently in a big way both from the central and eastern part of the state is Amazon this week they made a lot of noise about a Fifteen dollar minimum that they would like to pay per hour to their employees why right now is doing the eight dollar range what would you like to see is going to be a fair\nMinimum wage you're eight Fifteen or someone was\nWell we need a living wage so I definitely support the fight for Fifteen that a lot of activists have been calling for but if you actually look at the poverty tables and what is considered a ... a living wage for people of different family sizes\nIt's actually a lot more than Fifteen dollars an hour if you have children so I'm I think that Fifteen dollars an hour with increases for inflation and cost of living is a starting point but I'd also just point out that\nThe CEOs that Amazon and those other big companies are making record profits and the top incomes have increased\nA more and more over the years so the wage disparity in income disparity has just increased more and more so I think that um that is a huge concern for workers that\nOhio's workers would you support making Ohio right to work state\nNo I'm right to work is really the the right to work for you know very little money to not have union protections I think that Ohioans need or the right to organize and to unionize so we would we would fight efforts to Institute a right to work and Ohio\nSomething that's kind of local but does translate to the other cities around the state of new study here in Cuyahoga County of housing prices\nShows that the rebound from the loser the great recession very widely the often tracks historic patterns of red lining in segregation was wondering what would a dome ... mid ministry should do to achieve for help achieve greater economic equality for all Ohio and\nEconomic justice is a is a very it's an important part of our platform and I think\nUh the practices of red lining over the years have lead toward segregation and economic oppression for people of color in particular\nSo you know one thing that I think we can do in the lending market is promote state banks locally owned banks and credit unions um to really open up the banking market\nTo provide funding for mortgages and for small business loans to individuals who had been kind of locked out of those markets for years\nWomen mentioned guns and gun rights I'm do support additional limits would you like to see some limits we have removed where are you there\nUm I Would say yes and no I Am a criminal defense attorney so\nUm we we are also I'm a mom's demand action approved candidates my my running mate and I brat so we do want commonsense gun control I think that certain assault weapons um you know needs to be restricted bump stocks high capacity magazines", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "16"}
