patriarch yeah but\nYou mean what was the motive why did the men of ten thousand years ago [noise] want to see the upper hand at the expense of the women and their lives and yeah I mean what a jerk move casts a jerk move you all up and making ever since ...\nAnd here's how ... answer the why question\nSome people will argue that men need to tell themselves or want to be in charge because they are left out of the whole reproductive process really in terms of being the one\nThat can create life and uh even if people are informed that it can't happen without their sperm nonetheless it's a huge cultural differences in in many societies the creation and perpetuation of life is a really big deal right\nSo guys have insecure egos well now because of what it was amazing thing that women can

simple reason men built the gender hierarchy and put themselves in the top spot\nThe most basic explanation for word no supremacy appeared after\nHe arrived Barton poachers students possible controlled women as well as you press them [noise] because they couldn't\nAnd so it's about power really\nWrite that scholars say after patriarchy developed with the first societies to settle down and farm those cultures became the first colonial powers and they spread systems of patriarchy to the places they call I\nHad a question about this room in the idea in our society today\nI don't really see a lot of reverence for motherhood or fatherhood for that matter the U.S is practically alone among rich countries and not guaranteeing paid parental leave or help with early childcare we'll pay childcare workers a living wage\nThere are rampant reports of pregnancy discrimination women not getting jobs were losing them because they got pregnant\nAnd really even in terms of attitudes\nDo you really think the typical man in our society is an author of women's ability to give birth or do you most guys kind of see it as mundane no big deal something you're quite happy to leave to women\nI I I take your point I I don't think our society socialize as us to truly hold motherhood in highest\nWe got this thing you know maybe the original motives for patriarchy there is evidence that that was different in at least some hunter gatherer societies Mel ... told me about cultures in which the husbands of pregnant women eat plants that make them constipated\nSo when the woman goes into labor the that that had goes out into the Bush and struggles and strange to push out a heroic poop\nAnd then he comes back and reports that he gave birth to a stillborn baby wow so you know it seems like some kind of indication that those guys want in on the drama and the glory of of childbirth\nMaybe the equivalent in our culture is that you know is the high class guy who pointed his partners pregnant belly and says look what I did\nAnd you know I Want to pick up on something else um make conch he talked about controlling women's bodies and that is really\nA huge part of what meals at privacy is about for me men want access to women's bodies they want to control women's sexuality and our production of babies power and control isn't that another piece of the puzzle at least as important as women the\nWell here's how ... put it he says a lot of what has happened in human history over the last ten thousand years is about men's desire to control uterus is let me bring in one more expert here Lisa weighed she's a sociologist at occidental college in California\nFor example controlling linens sexual behavior and wasn't there wasn't a lot of reason to do that when men weren't really interested in being able to pass down their stuff\nTo their own biological child if they didn't own a bunch of stuff there was no real passing down to do and from what we know a hunter gatherers even if they understood the biology of reproduction\nEach other raise all of these children which are ours right\nBut when people started accumulating stuff land and other property and men were building these patriarchal conspiracies as Mel ... men decided it was important to know they'd be passing their property down to their biological children OK well their sons\nAnd men started to think of women as property to property they could trade by way of marriage for land or some other financial alliance with another patriarch property that could be damaged as an act of war property that had no more legal rights than a chair or a table\n[noise] and most cultures across the world that state of affairs is laughter two thousand and gender hierarchy with men firmly in charge and women having few if any runs\nThe women have pushed back with real but limited success in the last century or two [noise]\nAfter the break we jump ahead to about three hundred years ago in Europe and North America when things really could have changed they should have changed but they didn't\nSo they denied her and I see this as a door slamming shot for women [noise]\nThis program has drawn from a season long series

John ...\nAnd I'm Celeste Headlee and this special we're looking at the history of patriarchy where it came from in the first place and why it's lasted so long so I'm ... what do you want to know about so one section is gender and science this section is colonial science a\nProfessor ... of Stanford University is showing our producer her library at her home in the bay area eventually she gets to a framed document on the wall says this is the\nFrom ... diary this is the comment that she discovered the photocopy page represents shaping our own important discovery early in her career as an historian\nShe found a page in Paris in the astronomical notebooks of a German couple we often think of women coming into science as the twentieth century phenomenon but really women were scientists and very good scientists in the seventeenth Eighteenth century as well\nSo Maria ... is an interesting story\nBe an astronomer and she married the leading German astronomer\nWas not in Berlin they were looking for his status and prestige and they were worried that a woman would destroy that status and prestige so they deny her Mm\nAnd I see this as a door slamming shut and for women is Maria ... had been the astronomer of the academy in Seventeen ten it may have been that women would have followed that this would have opened a door to the regular participation of women in astronomy\n\nSalon she says in her research she found it in the early Seventeen hundreds about ten percent of astronomers in Germany were women\nAlmost three hundred years later when she was writing your book and the percentage was lower\nThat is incredible\nLooking back we might think it was inevitable of course Murray of income on didn't get that job of course male dominance would prevail for several more centuries it seemed like a given because we know the end of that story right but she seems to be saying he could have\nGone the other way yeah what happened to Maria van coal mine just looks like a power play by the man in charge of the Berlin academy right she deserves the job she was already in the job and in fact a few years after rejecting her for the position\nThey gave it to her son was Maria as her son's quote unquote assistant justice she'd been her husband's assistant\nSo the academy retain her services anyway as one of their inhouse astronomers they just weren't\nGoing to give the title to a woman just because that just was not done right but that kind of blatant exclusion was potentially going to get more problematic as you moved further into the Seventeen hundreds and enlightenment ideas really took hold right for many centuries\nOf the Bible but by the Seventeen hundreds those notions just weren't holding up anymore and societies newly interested in actual evidence\nAnd not only that this was the enlightenment\nAnd people were embracing the idea that all people were born with God given in alien ... writes an Englishman John Locke formulation in the sixteen hundreds we all have a natural right to life liberty and property\nThese ideas we're creating new complications for the racist and sexist societies on both sides of the Atlantic says ... dinner now if you wanted to not\nGive rights to women or two African slaves or to others in the society you had to\nExplain from nature why they are not equal so mad at me so this study of the female and the male body takes center stage\n[noise]\nOkay so John tell us more and then we'll talk on the other side\nAre at the assume ... says what plays out in the mid Seventeen hundreds is what she calls a war over skeletons\nScientific illustrators were making a first detailed drawings of females skeletons and even though this was supposed to be pure science\nThe drawings were politically loaded\nThe two that became the most influential\nWere drawn by a German man Samuels ... that a French woman Genevieve dark unreal [noise]\nAnd the story isn't going to go the way you might expect\nShe says both drawings had problems with the one by the French woman was the more success to the to\nGerman man portrays the female skull as large\nThe French woman portrays the female skull\nVery very large and roomy very large in proportion to the rest of the body\nAnd it was this goal in the pelvis that became the sights of political debate\nTo make this clear madam darken view didn't just happen to choose a model skeleton with a smallish head and abroad pelvis her drawing was out of proportion with any normal woman\nWomen skulls are slightly larger than men in proportion to the rest of the body but in her drawing darken veal made the woman's head a naturally small at her pelvis very big even though women's publishes or no broader than men's\nShe says Thomas ... drawing was more accurate but Genevieve darken views became the more popular image of the female anatomy the one most adopted by doctors and medical schools maybe because it's squared with an emerging narrative about gender differences\nThe new anatomy is a scientific foundation to the exclusion of women and on top of that is layered a lot of ideology\nAnd instead of if you take liberal philosophy that men and women should be equal\nThere was developed this theory of complement charity and that's the idea that men and women complement each other they aren't the equals of each other but they are the natural complement and this again shows that men should belong to the public sphere\nOf science and the professions and the state and women should\nBelong to the private sphere of the home and children of the loving and nurturing private life\nAppeal to anatomy help the patriarchal thinkers when their argument over the egalitarian that argument was real even though in a male dominated society and\nI didn't get be constant push back in ... conflict even know what you're seeing is a certain kind of stability and continuity it takes enormous labor to keep reproducing mad\nAnd they're all they're always moments when things went differently could have gone differently and then there's backlash oh\nWomen like Mary Wellstone craft called for women's rights in the late Eighteen century but before her there were prominent men\n... who we heard from at the top of the episode and other leading enlightenment thinkers like ... phone contact say lock in life and it's all argued with varying degrees of passion\nFor the quality of the sexes yes yes men are often wonderful feminist on the other side\nWhere men like Emmanuel current Francis Bacon and\nMaybe the most pivotal thinker and a woman question John shock Russo writing in the seventeenth sixties Russo appeal to the supposed anatomical differences between men and women women's smaller brains and bigger palaces to back his theory of complement parity\nWomen are less inherently valuable than men that would have gone against Russo as liberal ideals instead he said women were just fundamentally different but different in ways that proved nature designed women to serve men\nThe woman's entire education should be plan in relation to men two policemen to be useful to them to win the love and respect to raise them as children care for them as adults\nVisa or women's duties in all ages and views on what this should be taught from childhood\nSo Toby Dietz says ... he becomes the new justices\nAnd economic power and you begin to say well she's not as rational maybe say that you draw on that stream\nOf discouraged she's rational but not as rational\nShe is disqualified on the basis of her physiology you know female physiology she's disqualified because of our higher maternal duties you all of a sudden get new ways of defining difference between men and women that would work better to justify\nExclusion

what's it been like now with the center since the testimony of Ford and Kevin uh\nWell uh last week was a a a bit of a record setting weak in in which is it a sad way of putting it but we had a hundred and Ninety One um contacts there are hotline which about double what a normal week would look like for us um so we know especially on Thursday and friday\nYeah watching Dr Ford's testimony that um and the subsequent reaction or frankly backlash um has has a really triggered a lot of people do to seek some help and uh that's\nSome people are reaching out for the first time some people who have been communicating with us some folks we just never now um you know what what led them to communicate with us but this seems to be released during things up for folks\nI Know it's short turnaround since last night but last night President Trump was pretty much mocking Dr Ford during a speech he made in Mississippi have you gotten reaction to that people have been angry supportive\nUm well I don't know about that through who's who's ...\nMost things um when it comes to victims of sexual assault um even when we are struggling to understand exactly what has happened um that it shouldn't be partisan to to support someone when they claim that they've been assaulted in that it shouldn't be\nUm the revolutionary act that it is to believe somebody when they say that they have been hurt [noise]\nBig question I guess would be why do we think assault like this happen and you've studied this you're in this every day\n[noise] well I [noise] it it wouldn't make sense for me to explain that through the lens of how we talk about with young men and we have programming for young men uh we have a what's called ministry and club we've done a program called best foot forward we're a key partner for the white ribbon campaign which is with the\nUm our folks at the healthy father and collaborative\nAnd what we found is um that most young men are grappling between this dominant story of masculinity which let's just say that is what Matt how men behave\nWhen and if they were just given the script right if they didn't know anything nobody ever told them what it means to be a man this is just what they would absorb they're grappling with what the dominant story masculinity tell them to be and their own counter story\nAnd their own counter story is something that is that they need guidance and and support in writing the dominant story we could argue is pretty unhealthy and\nHas the story being movies books what you see\nThe cultural norms of masculinity that ... that basically we get we don't get to decide whether they influence us they they naturally do and and to a person they all believe that they haven't been influenced by it but then when we start talking about it we we see how easily especially teenage boys\nUm think that you know it's okay to that you have to be tough that you you have to use a humor and cruelty um at the expense of others in order to get social acceptance rather rent 'em that you have to\nYou know basically play into some really strong stereotypes of manhood should for your way\nAnd what it said really resonated with me in terms of you know we need to bring into the consciousness of young men and all teenagers I'm of\nThe cultural social norms and scripts that they are encouraged to follow that I find when it comes to sexuality in particular there are a lot of what I called sex patients that are pretty toxic and divisive versus\nBringing kids together inauthentic connection um and that performance sexuality is something that's a part of that unhealthy masculinity and not\nYou know it really does [noise]\nTo what kids want\nThe majority of my male students in fact I'd say hands down almost all of them really long for you know substantive relationships in connection where they can be trusted the trust thing and uh be cared for and you know feel loved and that\nThe sort of cultural norms that were encouraging those typical gender norms getting the way of that and focus on unhealthy masculinity so there's this tension that exist that they're trying to navigate that's a very difficult and a lot of mixed messages\n... million but [noise] you know\nOh yes for sure um you know it's mostly the\nAll the majority of kids um are not\nGetting sex education in school and those who are it tends to be a lot of sex information versus you know practice in how to actually apply that information to the complexities of human relationships and also it's a lot of sex stigma a lot of warnings it\nCan also the fear based however you know there are people and hopefully more\nNow that are focusing on the positive aspects of sexuality that we can actually aspire to 'em and we'll bring kids together\nIn you know as they explore their sexuality and develop\nChanges from the time that you were a student to the students that you mentor and these days\nOlder and um I I think our children here a lot from what we say but I think they also learn way more from how we act and so\nI'm a husband I'm a father and my boys see the way that I treat my wife and I the the way I interact with her and and I think that's a message that they're going to take with them throughout their life more than anything and and so I think that the way that we interact with our students as teachers and the way we love our students and it's\nMore than just a classroom setting for them together intellectual knowledge it's to teach them how to live and to act and and so it's a lot of other people and that's that's the the sole purpose of coming to stand Ignatius high schools to be more loving\nIf you'd like to join the conversation give us a call at eight six six five seven eight zero nine zero three they're all ... they're our callers I'll get to you in just a second I'm the idea of being tough you're a soccer coach you need kids who are tough and yet be gentle when you're not between those hundred and ten yard lines [noise]\nIt's challenging because right in order to be competitive are soccer program currently we're one of the top teams in the country\nAnd and so in order to win on the field you have to be tough but what is toughness um toughness is going out in the field and giving of yourself for the guy next to you a tough Mrs realizing that\nIt's by it's not beating down somebody else that makes you tough it's it's rising up the people around you that make you tough\nAnd and so it is challenging to ... on a football field you can't say to kids don't be tough\nYeah and just to add to that I think that's I think it's a great point I I think\nWe have just again we have made the performance of masculinity be tough is um and what I mean by that is like the show of um you know the the threats the\nThe use of as I said earlier cruelty and humor at the expense of others especially women gay men and people with disabilities as what it means to be tough and of course by the time we reach you\nAbility to cope with losing ability to um be rejected or\nDeal with being awkward um and we don't have those real conversations with with our teen young men because they don't they they fear having it and so it will be tough and so then um we don't bring it up they hope we will and and you know as a culture this is how we we keep perpetuating it and so we make\nThe performance of toughness be what a stand in for real toughness is and what we\n... I I think you know we don't honor um the things that are um that are gritty the things that are um\nResilient and we we avoid using you know when it comes to masculinity we always used the word tough and\nReally what we need is to foster these more complex senses of of being able to cope and being able to bounce back and being able to admit when Iran you know this it it's really not that hard but we just don't realize those skills are necessary they are\nUntil we enter the workforce we we start moving about the world and we realize there are many quipped layers to life right now I'm going to\nJump on the phone lines Todd's been waiting on the east side for a while to hug welcome back to the sound of ideas\nHey Rick like Alex ... Fort they jumped out to me that you is that you're talking about ... like to um if you want to address any of my responses to the reference to tough it is\nI was raised to believe and this is particularly focusing on mental toughness but physical toughness as well in reference to tough this has to endure it to maintain focus\nAnd that's that's what has always been to me that they might just a few years older than me so I came up in the same age they did in reference to I'm believing survivors which they ship the admission that I wasn't raised to believe that either is I Believe that the claim was may\nBut for me is so right off the bat just somebody who claims to be a survivor\nKnow what somebody able to sexually assault somebody so I'm not willing to I don't think that's healthy you should just lead a claim was may and if something important to you investigate it knows your education right now the soldiers somebody's evil like debt who don't even do that and it's coming from somebody who you also don't know\nWell hold on let's go towards response to some of that and you don't go away stay there all the answers to those words to\nA either a this is Alex and I I Want to quickly ah yeah I Want to quickly point out here I'm avoiding the the the current topic at hand um with with the Kavanaugh hearings I think would speak listening more generally I Am sure it doesn't um\nWe know that we can do great harm when survivor tells us that they have been hurt and we don't believe them so to make it personal just for a moment I encourage everybody if somebody tells you that they've been assaulted um\nBelieve them right I Know that what is what is hard sometimes is for us to figure out well what if the person who did it um what if we like them or we have complex complex feelings I I Want to especially um pull out the ... you you talked about like um\nClaiming that somebody is evil and you know if they if they've committed an act I'm like this and and what I Would I challenged us to think about is um it is very easy especially for us as men we talked about he's a good guy this is a good guy like him in and\nLet's let's come to the reality that\nOstensibly good people are capable of causing harm\nAnd that we need to separate acts from character because that way we can have a better understanding of why it is that charismatic well like people in the public eye like we've watched over the past year are capable of causing harm um so I I I think um well I I hear you in the sense that\nI'm In the in the broadest sense our country has a has had a history especially a racist\nWell I don't want to pretend that false allegations never happen\nBut I I encourage us both in our personal life to believe survivors and more importantly for us to question our assumption character and acts are exactly the same because they're not entirely I'm that good people are capable of causing harm so I I appreciate your you bringing those issues up that I can speak to them and I'm Sorry go but I Do things\nTo do it one more point a to point to the point that I'll just give me one of them [laughter] that's fine and\nWeapons to reference to be courageous and teaching what it needs to be courageous this is much more simple than you allow it to be to be courageous leads to face ones fear and if you're going to face you fear you face to face the rational was and pushed off\nAnd you focus that's a part of mental toughness and eliminate the irrational what pursuit truth over believing somebody that you don't know\nOK okay go ahead\nNo yeah I I was just sad you know the uh [noise] um [noise] but ... as men we should we need to come to grips with the fact that a lot of us have the irrational fear of being vulnerable and that uh emotional vulnerability is one of the things that keeps us from our living are full wires that one um we were going to take another topic\nRose up and take a break and come back and threats on you this with all three of you and colors on the line so pleased you're listening to the sound of ideas keep a word as we'll be right back [noise]\nJoin the conversation by calling to one six seven eight zero nine zero three\nOr send an email to as to why at W.
