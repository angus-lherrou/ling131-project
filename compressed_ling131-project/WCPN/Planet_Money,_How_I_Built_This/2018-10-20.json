today because I feel like it's fair to see become mildly obsessed with the topic of today's show\nThat might be some truth to that um look I'm a journalism professor I think a lot about at worry a lot about fake news and more generally I'm really concerned about trust on the Internet\nAnd it came to us and said uh before there was fake news before there was a possibility of like fake video and fake audio the world was dealing with a different fake problem\nYes fake online reviews people have been posting this honest online fake reviews for\nYears yeah and this is becoming such a huge problem because like\nYou know I go on line to buy a hover board and I don't know if this had report has five stars because it is awesome and I'm going to cruise around town looking cool or if it's five stars because someone is making up those interviews and in fact when I take it home it's going to set my house on fire\nIs here with a glimmer of hope for us [noise]\nYeah [noise] ... it's coming from it totally unexpected place the on line\nAnd what happened when he took on Amazon dot com [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Charles Schwab when it comes to wealth management Schwab believes in asking questions and being engaged so investors can better own there tomorrow learned more at Schwab dot com and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nA couple of things to know about Tommy Noonan he lives in Reno nevada he likes to juggle weird things\nSo just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and all have like an avocado and the onion and a a bottle of\nWater whoa that's high stakes you're dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds\nOne day time he was hanging out with a friend when he says hey you want the rest of this pretty workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift more and longer and harder um\nYou know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways ... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased\nAnd he says the Tommy paid sixty bucks for it\nAnd it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counterproductive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things on line like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just tell me sign up but unity he could build an online we'd be aside what bodybuilder skipped honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into their bodies and stuff\nBefore long super chiseled dues were logging on to leave their super honest reviews and look I Know not all bodybuilder sound this way but as I read through these reviews I could not not hear them in the voice of the situation from Jersey Shore\nEspecially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average views they're way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it\nSo the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that is not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise]\nUh yeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way\n[laughter] well seven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct versus [laughter] yeah so\nTommy software ran about a dozen different tests than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just it waiting\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review ... is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying ... only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust way they leave you say actually these cables that crap\nTommy says generally speaking cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews anything with\nBackup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills pissed\nOff we of course reached out to Amazon and about this and they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they send us an extensive statement about it\n... itself admits that they do not have\nThe fifty states you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even stay with high confidence whether a review was fake according to what\nAmazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFor Amazon that is a problem we have hundreds of millions of views on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words the Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon or actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRent like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review it someone buys a product that's good for the site that that that might come a time where there's just too many fake ... sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up\nOn the Internet shopping and we'll go back to France chocolate chip [laughter] even go back to Iran has really made me go to ... right

rod rod shake isn't that household name like say our shoulder but you could argue that what Howard Schultz did for coffee Ron shake did for chatter broccoli soup or the icy I go geez bagel\nBecause like Howard Ron wasn't just focused on a product he was interested in creating a space a place where people could hang out for a long time maybe even have a piece\nAnd as a third place concept that both Howard Schultz and rom shake want it to tap into in that ... became one of the fastest\nGrowing restaurant chains in the world in fact if you'd invested the seven thousand dollars in an era stock in Nineteen Ninety nine you'd be sitting on more than half a million dollars like two thousand Seventeen [noise] now the thing is if you met Ron shake say in high school this is not the pan\nYou'd have predicted foreign Ron wasn't even interested in business is\nPassion was politics his parents were raging liberals and Ron grew up going to rallies and volunteering on campaigns all over in New Jersey [noise]\nEventually when Ted Clark university where naturally he majored in politics and he was quickly elected to student government and that could have been Ron's life except for one day when something happened to Iran and I'd group of friends something kind of small but something that when you look back on it and\nProbably changed his entire life\nYes so we we were in a local convenience
