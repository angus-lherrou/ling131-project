farm in Wisconsin\nAnd do you still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably or you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before August ... a good started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had of ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nAlthough I Am a fall out in favor of the bombing of\nViolence by giving farmers break one\nOf the ways Carter proposed giving farmers in equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot of the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you'd really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nWell to produce its own food because it's our farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new is it it's one thing to provide stability is another step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk was going up more than six cents a gallon to just going up because the government is\nAnd you you hear of it and you ... back your forehead boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would do it as bad as a God but every instinct I had said ooh this is ... is gonna work out so well\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the story of what happened when the president of the United states decided he was going to help America farmers\nWipe buying milk loss of them it is the case study in what happens when price controls runs both feet into the realities of the market there will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river\nAnd the touching exchange between Martha Stewart\nAnd dogs are probably pretty fight government she you don't buy [noise] you've got to be on a special Maryland [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Charles Schwab who believes the modern approach to wealth management starts with asking questions and providing straightforward answers Charles Schwab owned your tomorrow learn more at ... dot com and from Americans\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which one you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like\nBricks and this is what people will remember as government cheese because when the government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great changed give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this footage\nIs amazing style massive crowds of people being handed bricks that or she is and it's it's the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps on any\nState official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment that government she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the cave full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military mess halls\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became [noise] we're ready for you many listeners may remember Saturday Night live match fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nRoman cheese and\nGovernments she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz clear the government chief from the refrigerator if the girl government she's also shows up in tons of songs\nAnd government we bought we would get like um\nShow where Martha Stewart cook stuff\nWith the [noise]\nWhere's the knife\nThat has already [laughter] government cheese\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than ... I hate that you know Belviq is okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to ban but I'm not running my own valve either but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat boards trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nParents doing the dance ... doing the dance strain but here is why government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nBut I Am a bomb on our way\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough well I\nThink there's there's a two basic lessons again economist Andy ... which one is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically\nBut the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you in budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that off the record very very expensive she's been to\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen\nBut that does not mean the government had fix the problem the thing about price controls is that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk one part of the solutions and was two jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk like\nHave people of America wouldn't you like to drink more male [laughter]\nWe took a a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every pound a milk they sold and we created the national dairy board but this is what gave us a you know the got milk milk mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches with a few other ...\nPension so these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the government has tended to stay away from buying cheese of solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies the Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again\nAnd then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools and food banks that'd be fair that's probably not enough to start building caves which\nAgain but there is a chance with the government maybe in the business of government you [noise] to the cheesecake
