the Planet Money intern [noise]\nAh thanks for listening I guess [noise]\nWould you do did you like run home and and and in certain like writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kinda mulling over for all for a while\nSo I ran down the mountain I got a new book and I started writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver I thought how can I take ... nuts and spices and turn them into something really\nCherry pie and make it just in my ... and are basically a raw raw and processed food and make it taste like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining there's going to do a lot of cooking and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and you're just gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like being like Dicky ball of a match\nAnd then you would like to take it out with your hands in like a roll it out with a rolling\nPin and then um I got to cut her and I would like a guide her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own I'm a Jew many cash digital sort of asking parts to help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting salary how did you pay your bills um within\nAbout a week I realized oh I had I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought\nI'm going to start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know yeah so whole foods open\nTheir first store in Denver at exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they in in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought\nI'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made so at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big thing\nSo I first [noise] you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say I would buy this and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or she's going to work for whole foods maybe I'll just do that\nAnd just just to clarify again how are you just like sort of funding that's been like finding greens and stuff this was when you're using your own money\nYou know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious at all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of green information in a month would go by and I would find out about\nA piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things and I would be so motivated at somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags and a little Chinese takeout box and and\nI Would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow and then another month ago by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and\nThen I Would just get really motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea phase and when I actually launched so\nI Am trying to figure out how you uh maintained your uh your optimism and confidence about all this 'cause I mean you're thirty two you're divorced and I imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this plan and and um\nKind of weird side project a lot of people thought that I mean\nI Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and you know they had their dirty climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh\nI didn't know you worked here and and people would see me and even if I had those moments with people were ... I Would notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen [noise]\nWhen\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen project in into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR and\nSupport for Ninety three three double ... provided by law firm of whom are in burn dedicated to solving business problems delivering legal solutions and putting the needs of clients first for more than a century more information can be found at ... dot com\nObama cedar presenting job by Pulitzer Prize winner any Baker this go story about the strange occurrences that a Gettysburg B. and B. features Dorothy silver now through November eleventh tickets after Obama dot org\nCleveland Montessori located in historic little Italy helping students grow and thrive in a learning environment which encourages self sufficiency curiosity critical thinking and perseverance\nCleveland Montessori serves students three years old through eighth grade attendees can join them for an open house on Saturday November third from two to four pm Cleveland Montessori an education for life\nDetails or Cleveland Montessori dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized\nFirst learned more it Raymond James dot com and from Tara data working to transform how businesses work through the power of data using pervasive data intelligence Tara data leverage is all relevant data to deliver answers to complex business issues Tara data dot com\nWelcome back to how I built this from NPR I'm tired runner so it's two thousand one large American\nIs working at whole foods in Denver and she's\nTrying to figure out how to start a company but you still have to have a whole lot of money and she didn't have any professional equipment\nOr even a way to process and package\nHer energy bars so eventually I went to a packaging company in Denver and they weren't even taken me seriously and wages standard that means that hey how do I make this them on a bigger scale what\nI said I Need packaging and then they they look at me go huh I mean they couldn't take me seriously didn't even have a business\nYou want it you were looking for somebody to ... who had food grade packaging package or bar shifts and and meanwhile back at home you're you're still using your Cuisinart\nYes this is using the ... and I was trying to find a giant Cuisinart I was trained that I didn't even know what that was called is called the vertical cutter mixture I learned and\nAnd then that led to some guy that had a piece of manufacturing equipment that low and behold was the exact thing that I needed that the the ...\nAnd that's how it all kind of piece together yeah and and by the way you could raise some money now and raise any money and raise any okay I wrote a story I wrote a business plan my dad helped me write a business plan [noise] I had a few friends and family interested and\nGoing to launch in fall of two thousand two [noise] and that got delayed until April of two thousand three and during that time all of my interested friends and family backed out they because\nWell I had to had to raise the money and my dad had decided he would look he wanted to get involved in the company and he called me one day and he said hey\nWould you would you want a business partner and then how much money did you decide that you needed to raise I think we came up with the amount because I had to print packaging and we had five flavors that I was launching\nWith and there was a minimum print run of all of those and I actually printed I'm at this company in Minnesota and I remember it costing somewhere around ... you know a hundred a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nBut how did you then find the stores to to buy and then ...\nWell let me let me backtracking to where when I was working at whole foods before he left so one morning I was there and one of the grocery guys he said [noise]\nLearn the guy you need to me he's the regional buyer from Austin and he's he's the guy who's coming in here I Am I'm taking trash out one morning it's about\nEight Fifteen in the morning and he walks across my pass on the back to talk of the store and I was in that moment I thought this was my moment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Planet Money, How I Built This", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "27"}
