broadcasting\nYou're listening to Planet Money\nThe other day I had an early morning interview and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of invited her with my my maybe we should say uh where are you\nThis is Cathy I'm Sorry I don't know it might you might need to get my name is yeah that sounds easy but I I I'm Catherine Rampell economics in Washington\nCivically captured writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing said he was furious [noise] All right\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nI think I have [noise]\nHow much the same with\nCars on the board to eighty nine [noise]\nMisleading [noise]\nSo maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it with Catherine ...\nIt's Steve in service charges\nThat seemed to appear out of thin air at check out and drive us all crazy booking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you booked a hotel room recently sometimes\nThere's an Internet the symptoms of the parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that's not a resort but anyways Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not application\nUh and the fact that companies do compete on ... did not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that are buying stuff that they don't want it for every one is a used car salesman\nI have a very good friend who's a used car salesman so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nThe price should be the price\nThat is how Catherine Rampell would make the world better with one simple tweak [noise] hello and welcome to plan and money I'm Nick fountain Dan I'm Kenny Malone and sometimes on Planet Money we\nTackled the world's big questions but today on the show we look for small dancers yeah this is something we've done here before we called the smartest people we know and we asked him\nWhat teeny thing would you change about the world to make our lives better we have a suggestion for how you can get more money from your boss how to make the most boring sport littlest boring man\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data we\nLooked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyzed a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the catch up ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much\nShorter with these games are dead the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost a half an hour from a game and a half an hour with the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have fans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime\nWell a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's\nAlso got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for down to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nSo yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd give them only Eighteen seconds at the end of the game\nI'm like wow you are a true iconic last well [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in\n[noise]\n\nIs there a tweak you would like to see in the world\nYou can email it to us we're Planet Money at NPR doctor or gee we're also at

today\nDo you want to introduce yourself it's me standing room lieutenant Danny Roman from the negotiator in the flash and are you you apparently have a two week for us to that you do great what are you got\nNever say no to a hostage taker manual it eliminates opposite the only option that lead to shoot someone understands\nIt gets that sort of makes sense I mean I don't I don't know that technically qualifies as like a tweak is more like a vice\nPatronizing me man ten at\nNo uh no offense you know again I'll kill somebody or I was in um I think we're going to end this interview\nThat's really too bad for daily role was just starting to like\nWow I never say no to a hostage taker life not not the kind of advice I Would expect from from Planet Money but it's very useful I think though that Mr guy rise LEDs coming up next on how I don't they\nWill ... we're going to Gary Hertzberg eastern amazingly resilient businessmen who is organic yogurt company had its

more ups and downs and ...\nMore downs than just about any other ... and it's pretty unlikely tail to begin with\nTwo eco hippie farmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company and they start small milking the cows making their own yogurt selling locally to nuns and then eventually spreading themselves way too thin\nAnd sliding into deep debt now over the years don't he killed his headache bowls slew of near death experiences\nBut it never quite died in fact it grew it grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states and one thing about stony fields cofounder Gary Hertzberg is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company\nHe knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire his dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so so how many people did your dad's company employ\nSeveral thousand I think at their peak they were the twenty eight hundred wow these are true company chance of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in in the region in the country were were built on things that we made the dark side of that is\nAll these communities did as well and what happened to your family [noise] uh well it was really a three a free for uh the family's business uh went bankrupt ah my parents got divorced\nAnd my ah sort of childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a it was a wake up here\n... yeah I um my father a got a began drinking\nUm [noise] and so I had to sort of confront all of that and yeah you know my mom became a single mom with five kids I was the oldest so dislike\nMajor change in your life happens at the age of fourteen which of course is going to have an ... an influence on you did you did you start to think about a business about being a businessman ... at that early I mean you say your parents were both entrepreneurial\nNo I I started thinking about running as far as I possibly could away from it\nYou know I obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was a result of a steady decline and my my grandfather my father and my uncle we're all in the business and I used to sit or work in there and I would listen to them screaming at each other\nYou know they were arguing you know uh I'm passionately\nOr about what to do about this downturn and so to me business was this thing\nWhere people got people yelled at each other\nPeople hung up funds on each other people were stressed or\nEmployees lost their jobs and it and on top of that serious of a pollution so it led to my deciding that business was the worst thing on the planet the last thing I ... I wanted to do and led me to really pursue a career in the sciences environmental science is\nCows and he slammed the phone down and we took that is very good business advice so we went out and grew are hurt even further and then so we now realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed to lease of small refrigerator truck and started\nNow about three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and a case like twenty four cups six ... six packs of court and so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range but you were\nProbably

Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon in order for us because by then the guy had figured out who you know send me I wasn't paying them so\nNow we're on very short terms with

rise so in the summer of Nineteen eighty four Gary and Samuel ends stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nThose days as a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of hope with\nAnd they had one store in Cambridge on prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket just as now I'm Talking July of eighty four and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we could crack\nBread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to her in the Tea Party with their wet go you know\nSo in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus on prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yogurt that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof\nWere getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first deliberate that afternoon [noise] um about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circuses and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles it's last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it on people's miles and then they're going to ask\nFor it and and this is a right around the time you meet Meg he would become your wife right yeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no compromise northeastern farming association covers and I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished my speech this\nAdorable or organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there\nI waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I got to about\nWe can increase so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money for friends and family money mhm it's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie\nBut if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful\nOh yeah you know what happened in this farm house I I always had payroll on Thursday mornings and and but at this point it was a half a million dollar business and I never had\nCash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking Meg was a sleep in our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office I Would on many occasions tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law to have a chance\nTo see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred and twenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law is on and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well because she didn't have confidence and then they were lifted she's\nLiving in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that the power would I mean we're on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere\nWas make thing do you look ... percent ditch this thing that's bag\nIt I mean or or did she gives it sounds like maybe shouldn't believe in it [noise] well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in and did you think that means you are you are what two three years into this thing\nIn in not only are you not making money you are in that big that big time yeah [noise] well I'll say this um\nAnd we had nowhere else to go [noise] you know she had given up her job done on a farm in New Jersey and signed on to this crazy damn enterprise but here's where the story if I Know that you think it couldn't get worse but as as a Lily Tomlin says it\nIt it ... it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what happened what happened well so now I'm going to jump a year and a half\nWe've now expanded the plant were buying milk from ten or twelve farms wow and we have maxed out this little farm there is no\nYou cannot squeeze another drop of yogurt out of this place so presumably you are looking to to work with another factory right so spring of eighty six we are\nOut of capacity we contracted with a little dairy in western Massachusetts Greenfield mass we were desperate we did not do any of the financial due diligence one would\nNormally do what happened for us was their bank went in and put them into chapter seven padlocked to place locked it up\nWait a minute your production comes to a halt I mean this is a outsourced relate production facility it just stopped\n[laughter] so it came to a screaming halt now we have no factor hitting you're making no yogurts we have no yoga ... within the factory
