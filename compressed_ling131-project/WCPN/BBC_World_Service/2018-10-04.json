Ken so children don't have to come to the younger siblings\nIn other cases of each year for another child in other kids it can be getting electricity for households which don't have it and that is how we were able\nTo create tried labels free communities that a country like India\nAnd by labor free and she doesn't mean that the community is when no children was what she means is that the work that doing no longer interferes with school\nLike\nType ... and she says somewhat can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with we talked to children and actually come up with a document called work we can and cannot do for instance milking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids that\nThey said nobody should be doing it because it's harmful look it's dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments they find out what the children want some like be exhausted by hours of household chores and thought to spend two hours it's working for a local shop others might choose factory work milking temperamental Jersey cow\nIt's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to make the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited\nBut as a child to perhaps continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give that child that choice in fact this kind of walk actually increases our responsibility when they're working with children die that Lee you don't let them take that one decision and then forgive them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life [noise]\nThen I was with children's councils throughout bind alone it's time consuming and expensive\nBut it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise] see I Alone the organization behind the global ban says no children under such an age should never what\nWe heard about the unintended consequences children pushed into more dangerous was called looked down by the authorities debate that will continue [noise] but when you take a step back it's paid the deal like human isn't just about policy\n[noise] it's about something more fundamental some particularly in the west the child under such an age who works is by definition being exploited others say a child should have the right to work\nAnd that's what makes it so hard to know what's right\nOoh\n\nThis inquiry was presented by me having to marry ... and ... take a sentence and if you want to listen to more episodes download our podcast such said BBC think climbing\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

on a per mile basis and the last five hundred thousand miles as opposed to just a hundred and forty thousand miles\nThe federal car when you're over and you drive a car a hundred thousand miles per year\nOver five years you need one electric vehicle or two and a half or three pets all car and then you take a driver out of the equation then the cost goes down further three or four times so you combine that on demand autonomy\nIn twenty twenty on you know you're saying to three years away you're saying there's a storm coming if there was a storm coming we would see the beginnings of it now wouldn't we and we don't really ... the revolution that you describe happening we do\nIf you look at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S was a hundred thousand dollars just think two thousand and fourteen and now you can buy a Tesla model three four fifty thousand dollars so it's come down by half\nEssentially they're going to be cheaper than buying a car\nBy about twenty twenty for half the market and essentially by all the market by about twenty twenty five now car companies aren't getting it after denials for the last few years\nThey're all announcing that they're investing tens of millions of dollars into an electric vehicle an autonomous vehicle technology so it's all happening\nOkay the electric vehicle revolution get autonomous vehicles self driving cars may well be a lot more than three or four years away but it's huge ... not to mention the technological hurdles\nI've been in a ton of vehicle and a lot of these cars are ready and yes there are regulatory hurdles but that's an analogy is improving explanation in several countries are investing the regulatory from China\nFor instance there are many cities that are already investing in making self driving technology happen in their cities\nBut with autonomous vehicles that is not just about persuasive technology you need the public to be happy to see these vehicles on the road and it may take a long time before the public's persuaded that self driving cars are safe\nNot correct the main adopter of autonomous technology will be flee will be the ... list\nA product which is going to be ten times less expensive than ownership of cars and consumers are going to start trying it maybe once and maybe twice in once they get used to it then they can adopted and trucks are car\nWhat about the worries about an autonomous vehicle plowing into a prosecutor that kind of issue it's always raised when this discussion happens\nHumans Carroll about thirty five thousand people every year autonomous vehicles are already safer in many ways than humans so that's a narrative that's driven by the income parents who don't want to see a ton of must have an allergy to disrupt\nTheir products oil products petrol Carson's on\nChinese said do you think there's a storm coming back how quickly do you think this vision of robo taxis will destroy the internal combustion engine\nTen years after autonomous vehicles already and approved by regulators which we expect\nTo be twenty Twenty one the individual ownership of federal cars will be up suddenly it will be over\nHow much of this is driven by your desire to see an electorate revolution because you're anxious about climate change\nThis is purely gonna happen for economic reasons we've done the numbers this has nothing to do with climate change his says a disruption\nDriven by people and companies making the right to economic choice\nSo Tony ... believes the revolution and transportation will happen regardless of any environmental arguments this he says is all about cold hard cash\nAnd even the oil industry the industry most likely to be up ended if Mr Sievers correct recognizes that radical change is already underway in transportation [noise]\nMillion vehicles by twenty votes so that is a very high rate of growth Matthew ... is vice president for new fuels including at ... at the oil and gas company shall\nSo would you think that electric cars are going to replace\nTraditional fossil fuel ... no ... quickly there's a high another show in changing the fleet around him and vehicles can live on the road to Fifteen Years or more and and then the case of heavy duty vehicles and trucks\nAnd other modes of transport these assets are very long lived indeed I'm not so easy to electrify through batteries with electric cars I mean there is a very compelling argument when you marry at a\nTon of ... and so they're not going to buy transport as a service that could be a powerful driver of baby a change in the car market\nI think it could happen quite quickly in politics or your major cities where and when ... when I listened as we've ever had gotten bus with someone like this you think could transition quickly cities like London San Francisco Boston\nSingapore maybe Shanghai I think electric Haitian is here already but it is likely to scale within the next five to ten years what his hold us to coal is the degree to which we will ... off the coast and I think it's also hard or too cold the degree to which\nDriverless vehicles will really take off from will technology really deliver on the problem is\nBut I think you have to keep in mind not is probably an urban model and I think we're going to see different ways of the courtroom ability and the countryside and indeed different parts of the world I don't think it's possible get to imagine the whole of the world you know following the same pie\nWhich I mean as a representative of one of the biggest fossil fuel companies in the well this is a huge challenge the reasoning is at the end of your industry isn't it well but it's a challenging the opportunity I knew you were going to say\nTransportation fuel will be gradually substitute to buy range of alternatives one of which is my first book could also include hydrogen renewable natural gas\nBut that's in the context of a market for oil is still growing maybe you know here in London or in Europe but in India and China for example the demand for oil will continue for another decade or two but\nWhen it because they're in the ... position to leap from the whole thing on they they could say right solar panels electric cars to get it I didn't need the grid that didn't necessarily need the power stations they could just go straight\nTo electric couldn't me while they do any of the great unless the coast one simply because it's impossible to imagine vehicles of the sky\nCharged solely from\nResidential root for close\nTo me we're going\nTo ... falls in the world so the residential solutions\nBut I guess part of the argument is video sharing vehicles we ... need to invest because maybe you need to three hundred million vehicles that just use more intensively we share them I think God indeed is possible\n... vehicle sales because pickles are going to be much more highly utilized because they all being shed by holding worked around the clock and therefore energy you may not necessarily decrease but he's not going to come from you'll main business which is on your own company well all my business and funding auto oil I mean all my business is actually the gas\nIn the longer term future of the energy system could be based on gas and renewables so we aim and to change the transition we have a growing presence in renewables\nWhat'd you say they're transitioning says if it's definitely coming deeper leave a transition it's coming it's already happening\n... of shall well the latest production tickets from Tesla suggest that is like in the company yet despite the antics of its charismatic CEO and says gene ... even if Tesla fails tomorrow you don't mosque when it's\nSo has achieved its mission because the electric car was dead before Tesla now the wheels are in motion here and there's no stopping the electrification movement\nDuty or grandchildren will look back on the internal combustion in the same way that we look back at the steam engine already kind of old fashioned technology\nAbsolutely I mean we have a picture up at our office of the streets of New York city in Nineteen Seventeen twin horses reached peak and the roadways and I think that we're going to look back similarly and be entertained at how the world function on gas powered vehicles\nThat was Jean ... and remember what Tony she said this could happen in just ten or Fifteen\nYears so stay tuned to business daily because we'll be following every chance of this fascinating road in the meantime we'll be back at the same time tomorrow [noise]", "show_name": "BBC
