Steve how you interpret it because sometimes there really are ... I don't always have the\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have something to say that they want to show in the video card and

I could listen to a song and meeting yesterday snatch is of pictures in my head like I just see like steel frame and then I just have to reduce things together\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't when I'm brushing my team got a point when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to stay away from is\nThinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't\nThink about the idea initially ... come to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down 'cause I Know I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I sent it to them and hundreds if another hundred\nThe artist go I Love that idea\n[laughter] a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I Do have to\nA little shocked that has come in in in my career based off\nPresidents of course it gets to a point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because obviously deposit I'm a business person second to last ... plus one plus one not pitching lawn cutting that idea very passionate about it I can see I can teach it I can feel it I Do everything from the when you look at\nThe jet you're going to win the ... the entire vision is what you just have to show up

to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't ... it ... you know you want me so I guess you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can't the problem is sometimes you get a truck and I like\nTo get us a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in a slightly bigger market or maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging hang ours I recently pitched on the ...\nStay on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in that ... busy schedule I'm not sure they have time to talk to\nHer I just have to come up with an idea and my heart for the best in our our didn't quiet and mail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success to show\nThat maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be a bit more competitive out bad because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIs the biggest skeleton you if you're fishing for me on the ad and Jay Z project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I mean yeah I had the opportunity of working of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then again it's not genes look beyond\nYou are listening to the conversation my guest slip to award winning music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you're operating at a level where many of the artist he worked with on huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think Academy of specific examples where you've had to navigate accommodating to sentencing holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points for somebody wants to something a little bit differently so just in does yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way because I mean I have to put myself especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps doing it's America's male dominated field I met the added cross all starting off\nOn television so I was a funny person that now want it to be a girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had\nWas every time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out\nThat I was one of those and they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what to do it is not like you know I'm a director now and it's like yeah I mean this is what we want you to stab when you come out of the stage and things like that and I remember just from one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept attracted me as a visual as possible\nAnd I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show and he called me like it was like actually love this treatment can I bite off your like that in the\nI call with this one and I needed to make a decision that popped into my head you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGive me just what I Need to execute this project and you can't get a better deal 'cause of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I thought that Johnson eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't habits is that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten a lot more boosted tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to you know a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because they just need a music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nLike I can talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very time when I heard like Jesse ... you didn't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging don't as\nA ... ... they're probably like I'll give you think it's their projects that I Do for nothing at all but that would have made me the most money when they came to me my budget was a little bit too much for them I really love the the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nAnd that particular project might not have\nAnd you just walk into this project right away okay so ... are going to be given to you can get ... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much you owe challenging it's funny because actually my the has not increased\nBecause it does a rule of thumb that older active get ten percent of budget is what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of a budget or we took him out of hand hundred thousand US dollars are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either hum let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand and that means that doctor would get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month what sorry you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because\nAs a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempest and what does that mean ten percent of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label in your experience how a male and female artist treated differently by they record labels\nI well in my experience and she's obviously general conversation and it doesn't apply to everybody of what we buy it really depends on the artist and like how much they already have to bring to the table but if it's somebody who is to be young and like a little bit lost and not really shore and\nThat stupid talented and have an amazing voice and maybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with all the riders so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more women than men\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] it's six o'clock

[noise]\nLet's begin a half hour and ... and the crush of line air plane carrying more than a hundred and eighty people plane disappeared into the sea shortly after taking off from the engine easy and capital Jakarta and a search and rescue effort is now under way up and speaking to our correspondent ...\nAnd the last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency Owens has reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut our lung which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat to be such an rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations\nIn Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors they both have sent helicopters to scour the seas in the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash or the rescue officials or any officials in Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash well China\nWhat they do say is that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recording of obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crashed some thirty to forty meat is into the sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane\nNation of this analysis I have to add but what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the washer it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had\nAsked to turn around soon after takeoff\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of sat yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea what do we know about line air and their safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of ally in air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however aviation analyst have also said to me that\nLion has taken safety most seriously over the last few years and has invested in safety procedures and that's been a statement that's come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find\nAnd doing Thirty years he remains like this to the point that when we had this car washer ... basically swept away a great part of the political establishment he was one of the most votes\nIt's our of someone that could represent a something new so do you think\nThe vote for him was actually as a tourist or both an hour or it was a vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in body the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the algae V. T. Q. community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going can mean with all of these comments and concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were appalling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he would reach where did I I Believe that the president institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible I Believe that hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strength of the president legislative and judiciary system\n[noise] now those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single really wanted better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that\nWell she gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose polo kid just to be his ministry of finance public editor's is an economist that is very respected in Brazil and someone who has very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring this trends and also twin boarded the possibility of it\nCongress stations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that was always a parliamentary system disguised as presidential system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the key decisions or they go through the parliament so the key aspects to observe his relationship between the executive between both for NATO and he's correlation base\nThe indicators that these relationship gives we gave us a da da Da Nang

tons of debris on the beaches are just one island or south ... island um is this the sort of thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on for that long because\nThey're not pushing tourists away but they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number of enjoys a myriad of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S out very much into V. they are aware and conscious of the need for us to protect\nA beach or I'll seize our water from plastic so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nOr to support what the government is doing to read a country of the of the plastic that we know ourselves for just about that lend up on our beaches\nSo there's measure there's just been announced to get rid of the single use plastic or a plastic container say they're trying to use one since ... be recycled how much difference do you think that will make to you\nWhether it will make a um a lot of a difference

that he does not only profit that should shift humankind but also how we protect the health of our planet which is the only one that we have\nAs many Americans vice president of the Seychelles trying

World Service Brazilian economist Gabrielle elicit they was talking about where the free market reforms could work in Brazil there is a cool a precedent for this in Latin America and warm that Paolo judges will be familiar with\nOkay with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies and other times Chicago's economics department was well known as a sense of for free\nMarkets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman and it was in the Nineteen seventies that a group of Chilean economists later dubbed the Chicago Boys because they do say studied under Friedman\nSets about making rather cool free market reforms to chilies economy under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with dramatic consequences or find out more about what happened from ... as\nA journalist and film producer in Santiago in Chile she recently made a documentary called Chicago Boys\nGuys were very young when they went to the U.S and the fifties they learn something that they never knew before these is open market and free market economy when they came back in the sixties they try to implement these ideas\nThat they learn from Milton Friedman but nobody heard them they were too extreme extreme in the meaning that they're free market we're going to ... everything and that people would will suffer a lot\nSo they couldn't go ahead with their abs of steel adequate at al even by the military and Pina pick came [noise]\nIt wasn't no fortunately for them to apply all day you know like they get in\nHas to be assured that gave them the opportunity to enact some of the theories that they learned about free markets are to them we can America\nRight because they didn't have any support among the traditional politicians in Chile\nSo they knew that they they military we're going to be strong enough to go ahead with their extreme economy policies so they saw these as our windows to get into power and to apply these extreme ADS being supported by the military guns what\nWhat were these extreme edge to them it's or does what kinds of things where they do\nFirst of all days they thought that the state was mostly on usable that the power of the economy should be in their private hands there is one phrase that they said when things belong to everyone\nThey don't belong to any one day we a distrust the states so they wanted to\nHave that small state as possible so were they successful they were very successful um they came to power with Pina checked more or less the same day two years later they were in control of most of the government and the civilian side of that the military dictatorships\nSo they control the economy in history the finance minister either social ministry and they weren't able to implement all their idea backed\nBy the guns from the military at some point sip pouring tea layer raised to an unbelievable amount by the eighties we we had more than forty percent of the population without a job\nSo people were really suffering we have people living in poverty we doubt houses without\nVery very extreme way off implement their their idea was bought by this the force by by their guns or the military if anyone wanted to complain the military's came with the guns and they stop any kind of protest on the protests\nThat was just a short term impact of these radical free market reforms\nSome people hold up chili is an example of free market success though in the longer term the economy was very prosperous and more prosperous than other economies in Latin America\nYes this is very interesting because it's too\nWe became the richest country in Latin America but since two thousand ten thousand eleven and\nThe people here in ... has been complaining about the long term results of these kind of success\nMost of the richness belonged to five or ten families the economic concentration hearing tea laced huge day inequality up is huge also I think we have to hide inequality rates from the OCD\nWe also have some kind of problems a depression rates suicidal rates of SAT rates delinquency and rates are really high so we are rich\nBut that doesn't mean we are better steel there is controversy if you come to to you will see every developed country sexist to material things are better than before but this society had to have a hard scar from dictatorship you know\nThe ... boys made that decision\nThey choose the economic growth over the defense of this\nAre more important than life at some point\nRight now we are I think I Believe we are leaving and change\nWe are changing from on their individual on competitive society to more solidarity society so it seems now after forty years we are becoming the country we want it to be a more happy country
