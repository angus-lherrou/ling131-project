you'll room on this or I didn't think that um she's a day being ducking weaving I think a great quality is that the reason is a unflappable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt\nThat every waking day the poor prime minister takes in the last of incoming fire for many angles uh mostly from those he won't have very hot breakfast breakfast or the new deal a tool\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing she is saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom the full countries in the u._k. must be held together and the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom now she has stuck to that\nBut in front of them we've all just to try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the youth and the principles of holding\nTogether and they don't just quite if I may interrupt just to because we are going on behind Irish ... minister Simon Kirby said yesterday they will be no withdrawal agreement without the Irish and ... and ... and ... story so all of this\nShuffling of papers and on different positions for different people in the end it's quite simple\nTheresa May see a ... year position is here the breakfast tears who appear to have a a means to stop Theresa May from from making any more concessions to Brussels based it over here\nThere is no way of making this work\nI think that will be a way and not stable to analyze it I'm Simon cave and they use various mobbed\nAnd I'm very fair minded essentially has the same objective as we do which is that we don't want to undermine the northern Irish peace process we don't want to how bold between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island of ...\nYeah and ... it's it's still a problem so you know people can argue amongst themselves and and adopt pollsters in positions that doesn't mean that the ones that come in any way to live the\nChemo gonna former cabinet minister said the other day this policy the Tory party your party is now under quote existential strain friendships between colleagues have been irreparably damaged\nBecause all these bitter arguments over bricks at the language has become toxic\nIncluding talk of from Brexit fears of killing his own for the prime minister carrying on new into a meeting so she got to hang on a cell phone nice being turned in her body what on us is going on inside your party but I I think\nBriefings using disgusting language like that just to be condemned to today like quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party giving the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now over breakfast it cannot possibly deliver a cut here in Britain ... deal\nActually I think it can because I think that in the next few weeks is the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal and I think\nWhen I hang on this is interesting figured out a vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me I can get through the British Parliament but it won't have the support shortly up some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off something members at least of the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll pillow for lots of those who are making the noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the the daily deal that's on the\nAnd they will pay check as all of a so obviously I'm yes\nYour former boss well yeah it's getting more porous Jones and\nHe says checkers is akin to a suicide vest being wrapped around\nThe British nation you'll response to that was just one of the most disgusting things I put it in multiple politics you said this is the end the Boris Johnson if it isn't now I Will make sure which is late so I put it to you that if you and people like Boris Johnson who used to work for our room with each other\nEven before this check his deal is put back on the table before parliament is the final\nDeal with the Europe your policies finish\nThat because at the thought is was bigger than the events that has to cope with in the case of ... as much a journalist as he is a politician says sometimes he uses this floor it language and what was happening was that he was really intending to get into ... with a wish to undermine\nThe prime minister told us that are listed that now after finishing off and and that's all if you you\nCan solve or if it's a bar is back at bar is in order to try and just get in to back off I had a policy comfort in the end actually that is what happened and I think the prime minister or will be able to deliver this I think talk or by people challenging to a much exaggerated\nFinal four if you are wrong if parliament rejects the build up three's a maid brings back\nFor you want the best option then is it a change of during the ... on a different kind of bill is it a general election or is it A People's a so called people vote another referendum on Britain's relationship with the Europe including the possibility we actually staying after all\nBut I think you know to have the ... the cool of people say you need to act upon them to make it possible that ain't going to happen at the moment but I think that if a deal put to parliament and that ... is that wood coals followed race around Seventy than anything we've been discussing today\nFrom your basic I've no idea what would I guess it would be we'd be getting it's a completely\nMy politics to stick together or to stop I'm having a guy that the prime minister all the time and to realize that you know if we get all this wrong we might end up with the luckiest Brexit oval pull off a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn which is like having Fidel Castro ... Downing Street\n... and we have to weigh in that but I thank you very much for being on TALK very much\n[noise]\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has supported by babble on language and

[laughter]\nHe'll take money from people who worked for corporations but he won't have any of their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate tax got him there and that kind of an appeal is\nVery compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help him when\nDoes this reflect Ben cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's watch Beto O'Rourke and other candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we\nAt the Nineteen sixties they said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign powered by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls and turned people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just click and and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only parts of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them\nIn terms of ... boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or work is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawn fats artificial ... points for people to come and volunteer\nAnd help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system he's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly send a big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can\nI guess he will be how different democratic presidential candidates tried to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on so far he has spent\nThirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital expenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last\nCycle bedroom ... because his car he losing including to the opinion polls by on a percentage point also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment tendencies he asked them to think the polls around\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas of all university found that Ted Cruz the head by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nCan you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial\nTo the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it but despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\n\nHere in our country Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one\nAnd anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties have oil may end up being fairly even so how might this translate into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump off to rule under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research I have a recent us jets that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential invoked his so how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending an online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to tie advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists in donor distribution lists or what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach protests\nTennessee but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nDoes TV advertising they'll work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you can out advertise\nYour opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day the more likely that means you'll get more votes but what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign\nYou know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race and all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early and campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign\nBut at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and they're not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to we're going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV's boats wherever they may be\nAnd voters consistently say that they don't like these things but campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive districts in states and Russia\nProfessor of government Mike friends separate oil this also talks political advertising we've been discussing we'd do wait to see ... of how much manipulation on line ... by trolls for example a line foreign actors\nMay have influenced this election that could be the subject for another business dating we shall see but regardless both parties according these midterms among the most important of our time it will become it yeah on BBC will serve it's of course but for now\nI'm at but not an end to this message see tomorrow [noise]",
