SpaceX rocket kind of shooting um spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the cost of the overall mission so he's he's a few really the deliverable that everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different

the benefits of space mining well this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that that sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects or their multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers and of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of\nThat quick question if you you go you've got your asteroid and your sites and you go up and you land on into prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do and the luge besides but it hasn't gone by that and there's going to be back for several decades\nA that is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining\nWe see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons so with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it were easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for\nHow soon will this happen it's happening now so you know you're going to have a ... starting to prospect on a particular restaurant\nFirst commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years
