racism and bringing anti racism into feminine\nShoulder is but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights companies\nHave to the history of ... as you say the failure of times of the feminist to make common cause with the black ... I'm frankly some of them have I'm quoting one who ... who says\nI find myself at the end of my into into ... feminist rude it's time to ... back into survival mode\n... dumpster fire live ... ... feminist agenda\nAnd\nI Am I mean ... ...\nPeople who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting\nThese by showing that there are a few individuals who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who\nUm is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact\nI'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr Blasey Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean that gender is insignificant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working sure it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same\nTime I know you've described as a problem I I get I get the into\nThat now the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common called American make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be on a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\n... is there any way you do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pull into groups\nOf us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and ...\nNot really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the difference is\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggests that many women a particularly those that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the President's Day how do you feel about Morocco bummer 'cause he's with the midterms coming up his reruns of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll GB the Americans not as well known since I said I go votes\nFrom every demographic do you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to to\nListen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American\nWhat they can stop for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements or\nWith a ... on a on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities um I had took issue with him\nBut that was a minor I'm sort of difference um within a broader reality\nThat we are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what where in election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition it is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nAh that the Democratic voters he said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the culture of liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino supporters that again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and ... group based politics it is a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I I'll I'll make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator who was the first a Democrat or to the elected from Alabama in a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women as the wheels on the bass but how do we\nYou're out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political mobile mobilize a coalition that's what we're looking for in this and this and there are little action will see\nWe will

director of the California Institute the telecommunications in information technology and one of the architects of the first prototype networks the ... says to the molten wed created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure has outgrown original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today and when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the a very ...\nThan necessarily panic about assault someone else's harvesting that data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform\nOr something else or they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the confidence IT Services architectural weakness\nWell you're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants that\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential\nAs timber nervously has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have it\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model at Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out is is is now kind of ... being posted that's absolutely\nCorrect and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time\nAs our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them that are bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the very attacks on the foundation of our democracy have open people up\nInternet pioneer and would be reform Larry small no it isn't just about identity theft and data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrate to buy the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nVaries Anderson is the founder scout hey I it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the both of them ... pi electing the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially at Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online\nI very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots you know I did a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent ... but generally the percent of the people retreats\nReally angry or division of comments on line is that there is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and heart in ... by their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIs extraordinary and then you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent of which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world\nKind of like living in the Truman Show\nIt is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I just people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator out there having that conversation and I'm telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably cause us to talking to each other or at least they sing them\nWell yeah I mean I ... when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or box or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them do use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire\nAnd the normal people get involved and it picks up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook and those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id\nEveryone else I Would love to see a major media company out there and take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company but it has not yet\nBarry Bonds and who suggests the variety of own says to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the ... pretty pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all those notes are connected in every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized a time limit on how you do see centralized\nBut it's also you can't delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social\nSocial platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic\nThat this is going to do we have a way through because ultimately we will go live with the Internet is not going to go away we caught on invented\nCan me I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we've outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I'm absolutely\nBut neither of them expected to happen quickly\nIt's not just technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation and legal changes\nIt's a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental and it's going to take years if not decades to move in that direction but the solutions are beginning to be on the horizon\nInternet pioneer Larry small I guess we should stress that this is just one vision a point of view that he's putting forward there will be many no doubt from Internet firms and elsewhere who disagree over the design flaw he's describing\nBut whatever size you settle the debate about the future of the net is vulnerabilities is clearly a key part to the public conversation now\nWhether the Internet changes will not then expect coals for an Internet three point O. to disappear as soon\nAs it but today's edition of business day you can Park City
