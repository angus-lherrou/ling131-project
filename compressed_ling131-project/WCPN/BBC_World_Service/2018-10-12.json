Donald Trump [noise]\nYou know we're different than the has\nTold the BBC though to ... on the actual full ocean to them you're young declare an end to the long wall and the current ...\nMoon Jae in admissions that that could be more diplomatic bumps and bruises along the way as he tries to persuade Kim Jong un to give up his nuclear weapons are correspondence Laura ... to the interview\nWhen it comes to have knowledge of war president moon is the son of North Korean refugees so one of the first questions I asked him was was this more personal and political for him\nAnd he said that he does understand the pain of war the separation of war I you know as I said his parents fled North Korean Nineteen fifty three they never sell their family again and he said one of the reasons why he wants to be president of South Korea was to help prevent war returning to the peninsula\nAnd for those who listen to little Advil knew that the the fighting here on the Korean Peninsula ended in Nineteen fifty three with an armistice never\nA peace treaty and now both north and South Korea would like to see some kind of end of war declaration and so that they can work toward the peace treaty but to do that they need to not the United states\nAnd the U.S is unwilling to do so until North Korea makes real concrete steps to disarm and give away the nuclear weapons that came out in the middle here to try to mediate between at the U.S and North Korea has been at president named Jan and he has had three summit with Kim Jong un this year\n... his current nuclear arsenal bought president made admitted that he hadn't talked about how that process would work in detail or look at a time table but he hoped that would be looked at the next United States North Korean summit which could be quite soon\nAlso Laura he's heading to Europe this or this coming week that he and really interesting he says that they will be bumps and bruises along the way but he hoped European leaders will help to mediate between Kim Jong un on Donald Trump if negotiations stole\nI mean in the past a European leaders have kind of looked at a concert and stick approach with North Korea yes they are quite and\nSupport or they certainly support the United states approach current United States' approach of maximum pressure they've been signing up for that but in the past they have to kind of more carrot and stick approach is so incentives to North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and he may be looking for president main certainly has it seems to be traveling to Europe with the hope\nThat European leaders can help him mediate between the United states and North Korea to find the allies in his past towards peace and I think that's one of the reasons and that he's heading to Europe and the next week\nAnd how is he being judged so far by the people of South Korea\nThe overwhelming factor has been his relationship with North Korea and has a developing a piece of member he came to power last year\nAnd just as the war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong anywhere at their worst I mean this time last year at North Korea had psychiatric six to ... nuclear test ... threatened\nTo resign fire and fury in Pyongyang and many feared the Korean Peninsula was once again on the brink of war so he has been seen as somebody who has been pushing for peace in his poll numbers do grow up after any summit with Kim Jong un\nDomestically he does have a bit of a problem because people here are worried about unemployment rates I mean amongst young people for instance itself\nBeing ... by the president and John for Sallie Mae Twinkie fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and matching they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated\nMacintosh jumps and he went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charge the will still able to operate\nUnreasonable funds despite the scandal and good people in Liberia now one month to up the story in a year long investigation on Tuesday was really young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by ProPublica and time magazine\nSo the organization was founded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier it was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground that's like and girls often and managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements that police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... began on than girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts and talk\nTo you know how many girls will actually raped in number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh on one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in care\nFor so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said that this was a community issue according to our investigation to minimize the role of the man who had been a central nine and ... who died an intimate relationship with the ... they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him and then essentially said well this is uh\n... may have contributed to his ability to access and to have used them grow their mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but that trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named lessons that can spot denied it tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate do you have there been any changes at all to make it hard to fool the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place it's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time\nTwo girls were the first time according to their statements to the police so definitely the organization tightened up policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak hit Liberia at that time subsequently Katie mile or who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six months since these rapes in our organization coming to light\nAnd that was journalist I'm\nHugh ... speaking to me um the school foundation of gold molded me has made the statement you looked into fourteen timbre of girls named John some of the abuse of both object to me on to their community and as soon as the false peace was reported to see just off the streets are undecided\nSo did you know it's such often President Trump ... and it's the other person who steals the show but that's what happened when Kanye West to visit the White House\nThe rap stuff who is one of the best selling music artist a full time to kill himself a huge fan of the president's ... visit to the oval office from Washington the BBC's Chris Tucker sent this report\nWith his appearance and the white sauce Kenya a truly made this the west wing\nHow does it feel oh it is good energy and this and it's good energy you know I Love\nHair and he had a fair amount of energy himself on one stage delivering long impromptu speech\nThat silence even President Trump Trump is on his hero's journey right now and he might not have expected to have a crazy\nLike Kanye West run up and a support but best believe we are going to make America great that was quite something that was quite shows are very ...\nAbout the criminal justice reform job's in education shoot off a picture of a hydrogen powered playing\nHe thinks should replace Airforce one but perhaps the most memorable many memorable moments came when he talked about the super human qualities of Donald Trump signature make America great again come ...\nThere was something about when I put his hat off and made me feel like super

of this President Trump building poll well with African Americans ... is the most high profile block supporter and judging by his performance in the White House perhaps his most enthusiastic fun\nSo what I said I like trucks\nAnd a visible well it's a sign of this era of personality politics in America the ... even reference to the presidential ambitions although we made a pledge not to run against the man he called his brew and that seems to be quite a broom moms are just\nYou know I Love you man that I don't want to say I don't want to put you in that spot that it and that's why I Love this guy right here let me get this guy\nI Love this guy right here\nAnd that's the heart I didn't want to put you in that position [laughter] that's from the hardest special guy\nOften critics comparing this presidency to reality TV but if anything this meeting of to self proclaimed geniuses birds and the surreal\nAnd it was Kanye West who stole the show\nChris not reporting snow serious

I think developing countries sometimes the attitudes\nThat are held by the rest of the world is that they are not able to\nFully accept\nOr see someone even from a rural part of an African country or just anyone from that part of the world as a fully hole and complex human being\nThis is an assault she ... in New York based Nigerian American doctor he just public awareness walk in Nigeria [noise] she told me that's been ... soldiers in the country and public awareness is live\nThe response that you may get from the general public from some people they may say I don't understand what is going on what do you mean you don't want to eat there are people that actually don't have food to eat and you're saying that there is food available but you just don't want\nA mental health issues I'm Wondering is that\nWhy is that is typically around mental health\nYour demons somewhat of a pariah from the rest of society some people will say any abnormal or strange behavior that they may know or deem strange or normal\nIs basically spiritually induced all you need is prayer all you need is some sort of spiritual intervention or cleansing\nSo not many people really want to talk about it and not many people really are able to get the amount of help that they really need when they are facing any kind of mental health issue and how\nWorried telling you about the lack of resources the people in Nigeria hit us suffering with eating disorders\nI'm extremely worried I feel that sometimes it takes one being on the brink of just before somebody actually takes a problem seriously and at that point it may just be too late [noise]\nA quick reminder you're listening to the food chain on the BBC wild Saturdays with me and then he told us this week I'm hearing about the experiences of black women have had eating disorders and why the prevailing stereotype that it's only white west and women who suffer is so harmful\nI've just been sneaking ... she adult he's been explaining how some aspects of Nigerian couch might to make people vulnerable to eating disorders I wondered whether someone have suffered from the on switch agreed with having out of this\nSo I spoke to a lot of ... and Jimmy ... block I he suffered from ... from the age of eleven\nNatures of society where um he pulled ... refrain from commenting on other people's bodies um even lift for children\nAnd you got them not just from the appearance but you also get them from adults\nEspecially from grown men and um it made me very uncomfortable on this thing with they say men would say things like um you know you ... which is like basically you're developing a bomb\nAnd then also women they would say things like covered this or your bum is too much or you're developing breath and like they'd actually be taught him like pincher bomb\nThey gave you the impression that your body was inserting itself into the public view and then it was your juicy to to hide it\nAnd then not just stopped but then they transmit very vicious comments about people's weight as well so if you're ... your cold or a ball and if you're a sin like they call you won't get fish and like they make all sorts of like horrible comments about you [noise] um so that was really where like the eating disorder started\nAnd we'll say anything else getting on you at that time that may make you take any ... tank\nSo several times um you know I had a um I some situations where either I have to physically got away from someone who was trying to assault me or there was a lot of inappropriate\nUm behavior towards me by older men or older boys [noise] um so that kind of compounded this idea in my mind that my body was a problem and it needed to be controlled because clearly it was attracting all these harmful people towards me\nAnd I think that a lot of them young nature and girls and like probably even boys go through the same thing because there isn't very much record for people who you know had been molested and it's usually in the new age I thought they brought it on themselves [noise]\nUm so because of that people really learn to self censor in a way\nThat is to start starving herself\nBut kind of told me this can be hard to date in a Nigerian family\nThere's too many people and the average ... household who can observe that you're not a fan who can report and like that will be dealt with the media can be so I Would eat and then later on I Would throw it up\nNow than a cat ... a closely guarded secret people wouldn't have understood she told me eating disorders in Nigeria and be seen as frivolous\nGlobally the average white woman is welfare than the average black woman so even one block people have eating disorders it's the units or well we've got so many other problems\nThat require our attention our money we don't really have time for this but we don't really have the resources to address this that's why it's seen as oh it's a white woman's problem because I think the insinuation as well white people have the resources to address like a problem a trivial us having an eating\nDisorder and there any signs that things are changing\nComing up after the news on the b._b._c.

I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia with some Eighteen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more arms and virtually any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... walls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether you believe\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask them really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia is that really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom and been solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia about his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening\nA Saudi influence around the world or a week and yet that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed\nBy the use of American weapons by the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas it's been a tremendous loss of life there have been cholera outbreaks it's a great humanitarian crisis\nAnd I don't know how long the Trump Administration is going to be able to justify\nThe transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia for that war which has been so destabilizing on the Arabian Peninsula\nMy Dolly Irish sheet we have talked to some length about the number of prisoners that MBA as his looks up for this and I think you put the figure in the thousands included in that number at least for a while with some very ...\nAnd the rich Coulson including a will lead bin ... one of Saudi Arabia's biggest businessman Nicholas Burns Austin interesting question about just how secure MBA issues grip on power is what do you think\nWell as secure a crown prince who had already guaranteed that he's got to be the future of king of Saudi Arabia would not actually behave in the way my hammock been said man had behaved especially at towards his own cousins\nIn addition to one in ... there was an important person ... de ... the head of the national guard in Saudi Arabia he had a military base\nAnd security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the oil installations\nBut if I may have been sending men it's secure in his position he wouldn't really result to these kinds of erratic acts the war in Yemen it's been going on for almost like four years and we have seen no end to the bombing using west and a ministry equipment\nAnd also expect tease let's not forget there are people from the United states and from the ministry in Britain on the ground in Saudi Arabia and we have heard that without us and you can support this war in Yemen would not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame ... war in the way the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between Saudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians\nA framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been shown that ground it has supported the uh\nAt a press in regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister prime minister of Lebanon and puts him under house arrest for him to resign to destabilize yet another country in the middle east and president that's probably another immigration and added a few genes crisis\nTo go that far without actually they us the main protector of the Saudi monarchy putting as certain conditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support is unbelievable\nWe have to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country NBS who's just thirty three years old he controls\nPretty much all leave us a power as far as we can tell on Saudi Arabia remains of ... Lee wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other\nTo the the strategic balance\nIn the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt\nInstability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world would be instability in Saudi Arabia Steve I think we're looking at\nAlmost a Shakespearian drama here you can see the promise of reform and the acts of reform or by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side\nYou see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other studies and and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turn\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered a this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those countries around the world that have close relations with the kingdom\nNot under the leadership off from time I'd been ... I've lost hope that there is scope for reform in Saudi Arabia simply because we've heard distorted off reform for several decades and that the more reforms in the morning stays the same and in fact we are seeing the worst scenarios\nBut are we our sheet here in London and make buttons in California I think you both very much for being on how to thank you\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

since the uh rights crisis you've seen trust in the major in the most important institutions that got the color you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that plane leave the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was Bruce on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people were left behind those responsible was\nPunished as quickly so you have votes basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that nobody\nIs behaving well anyway [noise] and then very specifically and perhaps one\nIn Egypt and an unprepared and us to believe actual empirical fact a lot of that's possibly does come from the rise of social media but there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe\nThe established median rogue nations that in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that\nSomebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't you when the moon brothers collapsed is actually that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the tea\nYes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the ... it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a\nLot of money just landed in my city breaking up because I just sold in apartments in London I went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in uninsured deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were really money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible\nProtected by the governments in Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people and smart suits trying to a shovel and money around to protect it\nNow that looked like a bank run technically it wasn't it was actually taking money out at the right but it looks like a bank run and if we hit strides publicizing this it would have been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was\nIf we publicize an image like this than we are going to get in trouble because this is gonna look irresponsible it's great to look for say where infighting panic\n... basically insights\nCan you get into trouble if there's a lot of confidence in that you've got to be really really short of what you're doing before you say that there's a bank run\nSaid just because you didn't report it at the time I did not report\nThat the climate didn't particularly seriously appear to me to say and ten years on because we've had the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about an ... by the ... level of invective and the anger vis a rose the opinion against the virus you know the least\nFalse one five to one against very powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nSo people saw it as you withholding crucial information that they should have had access to if you being in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media so she's like the ... where I was at the time of the New York times acting as a responsible filter of being your reliable source that you can go to for information is also dates at this point I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taken effect so and it would have been out there on social each year I'm ... now regarded as ... as a baseline of acceptable behavior\nJust not just the two thousand eight financial crisis is also social media that has created this lack of trust and\nPrecisely there was a loss of belief in the financial establishment combined with the loss of belief in conventional media these days information gathering is tribal people read the information they're interested in and they don't\nRead from sources they don't care about and when you put the two together what you find is that if a great\nAnd wonderful traditional news source does a great piece of it\nAnd we'll just corrupts anyway and you don't need to trust traditional media to tell you things\nKind of makes you wonder what would it take to budge someone's opinion on President Trump I mean there's\nSomething as big as a serious allegation in a big globally recognize needs to have a lot in New York Times saying a sitting president is effectively a tax cheats not the implication of the newspaper\nOr whatever denials era if that makes no impact what would\nI find it very hard to imagine that somebody made the famous comments about shooting somebody in Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him he was kind of right there and yes it's hard to see\nWhat's which change opinion at this moment given that opinion is so polarized and people derive their information\nFrom particular associates I remember I sense out just reached Donald Trump is delighted to tell everybody how wonderfully stock market performances so since that street simply comparing how he had done compared to Andre bombing pension and it's done veteran drummer and renting them under Trump\nAnd I go to a bunch of replies say where did you get that from was from MSNBC which the more liberal cable news channel\nHere and see an sorry I mean yes yes so you\nCan send out basic straightforward factual information about how much stock markets as resumes and it will still be treated as I ... you go that's from somebody liberal\nBecause there is so much talk about post factual wills but it is so suggestive of the sort of nearly and\nYes it's very difficult to talk about this in ways that I'm very very negative there is a lack of trust\nAnd without trust it's very difficult for society to functions very difficult for finance ... and there is a lack of preparedness to believe anything that you don't already believe also trust others to work in your best interests it's\nLess holds midterm elections but while there'd be no major political repercussions since the New York times published its allegations against him earlier this month\nThe New York state tax department has because of it is looking into the claims and New York city officials have said they've joined investigation to that the ... is a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush\nThe big issue is that this is a state\nAnd local level investigation and the president has no power to pardon at state and local level it's the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan prosecutor her going after the Trump entities in New York and at that level he cannot do anything\nSo if he really is facing a serious investigation there he's going to need cash\nAnd so that's why I think there's a very good chance that he won't run again because what he really needs and wants to do is to launch what they're calling TNN which has the Trump produce networked takes on C. N. N. and I wonder you know is this why he's meeting with Kanye and you can see him beginning has set the stage as it were\nAnd he's going to say look I Won the prize I did everything that I needed to do the not done that in there done that and\nI mean I have a much bigger more huge platform as he says which I think he'll be right about because actually having that kind of a media platform will be more powerful than the White House where he has genuine constraints\nBut if he's doing his own news network if that's what's in the pipeline for him I mean if Fox News is on his side he's ...\nHave you know he'll do everything from reality t._v. too political talk shows and it will be outrageous as you can imagine but I think the key thing is the world of journalism is paying so much attention to the Mueller investigation which is actually yielded relatively little\nOr no attention to the state and local investigations which are\nSo that threat is a very real thing and as you say these are state investigation wreck he has no say of a state if it was a federal investigation and ... is a federal investigation left in a way he needs to worry less about that\nAnd worry more about the tax investigate oh I think that ... that is right\nAnd I think it's also very interesting one of the things that Brett Kavanaugh had specialized him was the fact that the president can pardon almost anything at the federal level and now he's on the Supreme Court okay so now we know this is the situation but state\nAs a whole different thing\nTo the ... the Trump news network I stick with a dependable BBC but then I Would say that for me and today's producer Lawrence nice business daily is back again at the same time among [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "12"}
