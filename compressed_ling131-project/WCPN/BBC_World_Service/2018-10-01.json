across the world today what\nBrexit has had a lot to do with it because breakfast has been a slap in the face of progressives independently of whether you about\nExits well I mean I was gonna say labor party view on breakfast is extraordinarily confused\nSo I Want to say you sound fusing issue if you're not confused when you're facing a confusing issue you a fanatic but\nGiven the Coleman's position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the momentum and undoubtedly\nYou said it was it create the ... in this country that British democracy and they throw in the world and not be taken for granted it means to\nSee their their position in the world and I believe that the judge me has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last ... years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively tied to the economy's growth onto bubbles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's closing a reassessment they'll face\nEven with that or is interesting and so you would say because you talked about last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of neo liberal economic ... you would say the Tony Blair was in no way elective sent a politician would you\nWhat does it mean on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money to the national health service\nMoney that they thought he said stop the national health service off but that that very same time he did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye to the private money ... thing of the private banks\nAnd creating the circumstances that lead to because I was in an eight and to the collapse in two thousand and eight so what is\nWhat I'm getting too is that the John Macdonald ... the the current shadow chancellor of the extra care here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. ever need to have\nTen percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of dividend to be received by each work on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it would actually be a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote\nFor that I think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing to McDonald's about the program we eras things you've been saying for scientists\nThat every ... or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund and then the dividends are distributed the former universal basic didn't\nWhereas the neighbor by the is giving them up amongst the workers within those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet this is part of the Labour Party conference he may go into the money first of all I Hope it does is he is a very interesting discussions are that we must have even the thought is must have\nAbout the division between competing in labor but it differently statement once upon a time when and that's there's both a machine that machine belong to the ... list and then the investors who claimed the profits of the machine produced for the company but these days of Google and Facebook\nWhen every time you such and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting at a time for that except for Google we have to consider that property rights over that intensive capital and labor that everybody is the only party in the world that he's doing these okay\nSo for you definitely UK labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually in the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas I'm not gaining very much traction if we leave aside the United kingdom so I disagree with you is\nIs there any way I look at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP ... say she said recently and there's no such that we need to topple the government and we can't do it at the ballot box we will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that you kind of\nPolicy was actually a strike is not illegal to last time I check on another legal immigrants how he's right that your view on when you're all kinds of politics needs to go\n... ... let's be clear to because these are dangerous times with their eyes off like\nDo I answer that game I'm going to quote from which some church for\nThe Democratic process is a pretty awful it's pretty nasty but it's the best of all of sudden Dave's and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think that is pretty straightforward answer to your question now whether strikes of part of the political democratic process I Do believe that they are\nOn the ... we have to end ...

still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... things that ... this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects I mean it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand eight actually as the financial crisis in the west stones to discern ripples through true or not\nUm and uh it was actually a toy when the Chinese economy itself was actually going through a little bit of its own kind of tipping point so really what's happened in the last ten years in particular I Would say about the the Chinese government\nSo every time they called me looks like it's looking a little bit worldly\nI'm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments are on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about ... leads to you know better growth\nAnd she is a huge contentious issue because some of us believe actually the sequencing works the

you know like so many things in everything is so nuanced so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure of population\nOf course there's still some way behind Japan a soul in Asia or you know American cities and European cities but um you know as long as ... that kind of famous British economist wants that in the long run we're all dead\nAnd what we have to be concerned about really is about the myths allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks go cities and and actually the problem\nAnd it can also lead a goal to huge amounts of public debt where how biggies Chinese public debt well uh it is about\nThe end of two thousand and Seventeen was around three hundred and fifty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat whether that there is any magical number at which
