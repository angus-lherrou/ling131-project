that's up to the politicians I think that's obviously the big question therefore says it seriously alarming and somewhat hopeful that we can make one point five but the question that has to be

Copa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually warm\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warmth is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and some tropical ocean temperatures then you're likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale full wins the Atlantic side clinics But Kevin read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most protests\nThe description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which used as a great to likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the ... I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific action changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer area than cooler area but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have done without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initialized nation so that when we run these modified forecast with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nMe that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and uh\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese conscience of geographical variation can lead us look under a bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light of Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially ... then rapid changes in the Arctic causing even greater alarm they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked\nFor each winter Julie in St roughly ... percent was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and for a beer it seemed kind of smell the continuing decline in the car is\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice camp and also thick enough\nTo support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these buoys and ice that may be a meter sick and you're hoping that it will still survive\nAnd locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through about twenty centimeters of melt since we had deployed them which gets worrying because of the ice gets too thin and booze melt out then we lose our data\nJudy instruments pony research is directly related to the climate slash whether shoes off this program\nThe reason why we're so interested in the Arctic is that the Arctic is sort of a refrigerator of our planet right so it helps to keep our planet cooler than it otherwise would be and it does is by the fact that it's covered mostly by snow and ice year round\n\nComing up after the news on the b._b._c.

and what he really meant well what are you going to do now\nAnd she expected me to have a job because he expected me to pay half of my income to my mother for my board and lodging that was my responsibility for my children are listening there is only the um\nAnd so my friends Susan Gulf me a job in a farm shops selling carrots and things and I hated it so I went across the yard into the

overwhelmed by the scale of something that you have to face and I'm thinking of the ... what I mean for example are probably many of us remember how awful\nIt wants to hear that news in in the very

there\nThere's no doubt that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime I draw that they were scared by true crimes done by absolute and utter fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nSo in your view is important that we are talking about how a ball they can be ... if you think it's important to get into detail how difficult it will is\nBecause there's so few people will ever become a member ever the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely slim but those people who reads forensic novel\nQuickly smell like something that doesn't sign right so what I have is a huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go and research what does it really like so that what they're doing is they're respecting their

father took a long time to die because of all climbers on what was hard once they're dying\nTheir deaths wasn't hard on them being that wasn't hard it was watching quote they went through in the dying process\nSo whether that was painful whether this protracted whether it was there was some whether they'd they'd never wanted to be I'm finding that came for both of them it was an absolute ...

he had enough he stopped drinking he stopped eating he turned his face to the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that last brass on on the rocks all that you hear when they talk about\nHad no trouble leaving my father's body but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in the last brass\nSomething changed but my father ceased to be on the boat he that was left was
