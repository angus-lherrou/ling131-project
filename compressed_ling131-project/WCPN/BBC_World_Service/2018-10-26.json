Afghans away from polling stations\nNonetheless millions didn't to announce on results will be declared next month\nThe government of president Ashraf Ghani is likely to hail approach that says evidence of progress on the road to stability\nBut beyond the rhetoric want as reality look like the Taliban operate with impunity in waves of territory the national security forces are short on numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my guest is President Ghani has recently appointed national security advisor having to do a lot more he formally Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat with little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country\nWell haven't dilemma he joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome to talk ...\nGood to be here we speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you uh accent that the\nWay those elections work out with so many Afghans\nAre facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and a lack of government control of key parts of your territory like Bruce Lee exposed everything that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban and there is precedents of attacks on polling station\nOn what the AFC on people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life this was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the Andy SF\nUh I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those\nThree or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle that bravery for one second but here's the reality your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country didn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar and the guy's name a there was no voting because of security concerns of course there may be some\nMore voting next week we're not quite sure we know that your own in\nA transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy's a plus the dozens killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling stations one has to conclude\nThat off the Seventeen years off post Taliban governance the government in Afghanistan is still not delivering for its people\nWell the government of Afghanistan is delivering for its people and ask for where we didn't have elections for insecurities of course we took risks are but we didn't want to have the\nI issued a statement to our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed death\nWhat I'm mindful law mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the ... so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life and know gains because our country is not secure\nHe said that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from NATO forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold Walt because this is all you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see t._v. there is so much more to that context I understand that there's only so much news\nA space for them on a sunny and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate but this is a transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm a generation Seventy five\nAnd bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yeah that's where a war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a ... it takes more than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures everyday and thanks to resume its support who are being helping and equipment and training or security or I just\nGot to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time as someone who have said let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing the U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently though Eric Prince formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this in we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit a\nIt's an honorable costs\nThe country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now\nIt turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan\nAnd why is that on my ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion
