just had a little bit more what exactly is ...\n[laughter] oh it's my pleasure thanks a ... a microscopic mineral the forums when the common minerals or con get squeezed by the crushing pressures during impact it's very rare\nAnd what sorts of impacts and we ...\n[noise] well read I can form a couple of different size impacts but the site we founded in Western Australia near shark bay along\nThe coast or is one of the big ones that puts it in a rare class\nAnd part of the controversy is people in the past it argued about its sides are discovery of read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class of that that doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones that's rare in our history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to us and that is what you have a a beat up just average\nYeah here the uncertainty behind this and why it hasn't and discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamb\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried ... and when we want to study at today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense [noise]\nThe dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts can cause dramatic changes uh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impact as a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called would like we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that size it's the biggest fan\nFest I just off the air and capacity thank you very much for talking to Newsday [noise]\nNow in about Ninety minutes time world updates going to be Nineteen year on the world service standing is here to tell us

up for grabs the honor of appearing on the new bills\nBritish money has never featured if you're a person of an ethnic minority but there is no campaign it to have World War two heroes nor a night time as the featured person that has eighty is the woman who started the campaign and she joins us now to tell us more about nor is remarkable story\nVery great to speak to you I don't know many of our\nThanks for having me I'm nor is a person's rations me because like I put into you know Indian impacts on the origin I'm an immigrant I came here the u._k. when I was five\nAnd growing up I I had heard about this woman story and it just became more residents to me and it struck me that very few people knew about whether they were all ethnic minority origin or or Asian or Indian or whether they were purchased a meaning I'm white British\nSo in terms of a story she was a Muslim sissy pacifist she was born to an Indian father an American mother and she was actually a children's writer and Paris than when World War two broke out her family moved to the u._k.\nAnd she volunteered for the women's auxiliary apples um\nTwo years later she was picked up by the special operations executive which was a special unit created by Winston Churchill\nAnd she was the first female rage to operate a to B infiltrated into any enemy occupied France aged just twenty nine years old so essentially she was part of an intelligence unit yes yeah I have a time when the nine ...\nAnd one of the leading ones because what happened was the stock was talked to round up um their spy network and\nShe was she was she she was suggested to come back to the u._k. but she did not want to abandon of French colleagues without communication so she said and she singlehandedly this Indian woman a pacifist a Muslim Snoopy she ran a cell of agents by his self\nSaving countless of lives and the sad thing is\nShe was captured by the Nazis she was tortured and famous they never gave up any information and then she and others were transferred to a concentration camp beats and again and have a parent final word\nWas liberty liberty to you know uh you know and and Tom took an MP the chairman of the ...\nBut not only ... courage but the courage of all these women who seemed to be forgotten somewhat\nAnd is this why you decided to start this campaign to honor to honor her story but also to bring it to the spotlight yes absolutely\nI mean the thing is when you look at these campaigns and and you ... your your um your listeners might know that that's ONE Campaign to to have Margaret Thatcher the former prime minister on it there's another of a sort of funny campaigns have Harry McGuire a football or writing or am I you know an inflatable cone on it\nI'm all Kathy said we could come in\nA ... and and and and and when the day because of the multiple reasons why newer make such a good candidate festival has story does provide great inspiration of of leadership service bravery sacrifice you know I think everyone could recognize them that cuddly\nYou know the educational value for young people is important you know we should know about these stories not only ... but all these women of of the special\nElection for the forgotten figure is basically or they figure is\nA well well to quote the movie absolutely you know why don't we know about it and and and with regards to your program you know there is a wider debate society right now but you know what's taught in our curriculum you know why don't you know knowing more comfortable stories\nKnowing most of mixed heritage stories um and that's that's important but also you know we've never had an we've never had a historical figure on about no that's the right to the army so this is about why to professional representation there's never be the minority ethnic\nIt there's so much I mean there's so much going forward that campaign and there is there's been a lot of support for it you think he might happens are\nKnow what I'm quite positive but the only thing you can do is keep going I'm just too but I I I had a big ...\nA ten pound notes for Jane Austen\nAnd the people who put in place um that that that the suffragette statue in parliament square posted\n... loss yesterday the ... group on on British Muslims oh this is cross ... decided to support that just beginning to really take off and I just hope that you know

you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in clumps ... there was seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crashing down\nAll watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come in ...\nThey were not getting in their economics tosses a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions of the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives\nAnd one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become windy column is most of widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must stumped subjects but we usually important in terms of understanding the crush\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy so the the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has not changed\nIt has changed I rose and your textbook that that really catches it in other words read my coauthor we felt really challenged and I think that was true not just about that of many others\nIf you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they give bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to uh\nAnd it's cool this was a concern I feel passionate about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the court charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the particles which are bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nHad massive monitor using economics professor at Stanford University in the U.S she's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to bind even criminal behavior by buying cars that can freshman financial stability\nThere's definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding sentences and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment sets and tire early unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they accept the system and does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more about you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before\nLet's fix it but then the fix is really\nNot quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nNot much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes to\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics since Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives that\nMiss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was that it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys themselves things in their self interest and traits freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were\nMarkets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to a country [laughter]\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem with the hearts of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were a science and the only works if you mentioned all humans are the same responding in the same way and ... contributions to the economy can be counted\nJournalist Katrin muscles book who cooked Smith spinner argues the traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity to be self centered so unlike humans as almost a different species in fact some record numbers have given the species the main ... economic\nEconomic ... doesn't have any feelings at least they failings and not relevant to his economic decision making he's this set of Russian old big calculating brain that is always acting out of self interest and all of this sort of characteristics or characteristics that we have been taught to view as a male\nAnd even more obese is sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to exclude from these models like\nEmotions family the faulty feelings compassion and altruism and all of the things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant these are not anything that we need to studying economics days like ... the same things that we have been torched it view as female I Know ... off to the Chrysler people were saying\nThis great is a good philosophy and is very narrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back and we can't solve our economic problems\nAnd and failed economic models in economic theory that is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin that assuming that people are simply rational neglect keyed mentions of what makes us human that this was an important reason why Congress fail to see the crisis coming\nThey do not understand the who Bruce collusion and trading testosterone that makes bankers appear to be on steroids even when they not\nMarket during his rights to highlight the rest of the factors that influence decisions she's expecting too much of economics or indeed any discipline to incorporate all aspects of human behavior the growing depth and breadth of knowledge requires more specialization but to understand how to tackle real world problems more into this marriage is required\nThe financial crisis happened in my view not because the tools didn't exist in economics to understand what was happening but because the wrong tools we used\nAnd challenging questions were not being asked to individuals and institutions inside and outside economics discipline the reason for the financial crisis may be not that economists don't understand psychology was sociology\n\nYou're

I'm part of your family the things you do for yourself and free day must have these elements in the days you missed one of these things I said it it causes some kind of tension\nCan you if you have the choice divide your day in a way where you can achieve all of these things and if you could would that make you feel more content would that make you more comfortable with that make you more creative I think so so that's the environment we want to create\n... labs so that kind of sucks\nDay so you could work twenty four hours a day you could work all the way through the normal working day but also evenings weekends on holidays\n[noise] Gail Kidman is professor of occupational health psychology at the University of that is such a here in the u._k. basically\nHave to become ... or ... managing themselves up perhaps crashing rules to make sure that based on to overwork and when not terribly good at that it's very much down the individual at the moment because organizations don't give people guidance just imagine\nYour officers closing up and you're going to be expected to work from home or what flexibility you know from coffee shops such truck\nOrganizations don't tend to give people guidance of how to actually do this psychologically they tend to lead people to self manage they make if you got ... to ... you know the right type feel desk at home and get up every hour let's say for a few minutes and walk around but [noise]\nBut the risks to well being in terms of being overthrown\nAlso loneliness living in a virtual worlds way you never really see people also the distractions perhaps of working remotely and this is the kinds of research that was living at the moment\nWas actually helps people become more what we call a resilient to engage with technology animal healthy and sustainable way of what does it help someone become more resilient well we have to crate rules for ourselves in terms of being on 'em up being away from technology\nIs feeling and control it's things like switching off email notifications when you're doing something about involves\nA lost the concentration and creativity because you know it's ... it's very stressful [noise] being aware of what we call switch and costs and it's very common for people to be you know you're working for a while on a report snow all of a sudden you're saying\nReaching her emails and then coming back to the task but the switch and costs can actually adds\nSeveral hours a day to your work because I Know halo yeah it takes a long long time to get back into the mosque so being aware of these problems\nAnd also being aware of the lure of email one of my colleagues coals email a bit like a a wrapped up present you think about what to make it could be something really interesting it it's all just email anymore\nIs it it's ... messages a semi nude there are companies that have ... groups for all their employees and what you expected to\nParticipate in that is right tons of coal ... one of the interesting things that I've actually found out later today is the most organizations um most individuals don't see this messaging and email out of trauma communications as politics than normal day to take a job well actually they spend over four hours a day on it\nBut it's not in the job description\nSo perhaps making sure that you don't ask your email on to the end of the day I'm your your your communications as well because they say that it's going to seriously lacking some you're working day\nProfessor Gail Kidman so we're working in ways that increasingly impinging on personal lives what does that leave an employee's rights to prove to see a right to a private life separate from work\nIs the opposite to go the way from where employees now the legal right to avoid work emails outside working hours it's a question I put you Ellen temperature and she's a partner at the little from Louis silken here in London where she covers employment low and workplace privacy\nI knew what the rationale for the French legislation was\nI think from the u._k. perspective the concern would be around the idea that you never switch off and the other reason why it's quite difficult to come up with legislation that does though to be too restrictive is that whilst won't pass and may fail under pressure\nLeaving the face and being able to access systems for ... device gives them say yeah if you have to leave to catch the child but you still go to the final to meet you can do on the run and that's to some people in advantage so it becomes very difficult type thing to say that there is one rule that should save everyone else was what it does indicate is that\nBecause of what communication because communications the wages that we have them when all smartphones we have ... phones the delineation between your home life and what life is becoming increasingly blood and I imagine that ... communication is a lot to do with\nThat I think that's true I think you know as I said we access what stuff\nI had when we come and help us as equally we were looking at what soften Instagram at work so you know what I mines that distinction becomes blood and we probably don't switch off as as we would have done in the old days where we left work and there was no possibility to connect with the office except for the phone cool\nWhat's happened then is already that people's right to privacy in the home from work has already been some\nDiminished I think it's very difficult question because that means that writes pregnancy but it's not an obsolete right say it's all about violence Seventy employee on one side of the scales has the rights to privacy which encompasses a right to say should interaction so the right to correspondence\nRight to form sexual relationships\nWhether that's that was cool I ... ... doesn't really look at it so we could geographical location when they ... say what you send them ... will you send in a workplace system it can still be passing it could still be private\nBut he ... on the other side of the balance if you like all of the employee's rights to protect the business to protect that reputation and it's about balancing those two conflicting often competing sets of rights and the the little has to testify in the balance have you had any case\nBecause as you say they blaring between highly became ... there are plenty of cases in court say one of the most recent leading cases if you like is the case before the ... of human rights and stress book\nWhich involved a roommate in ... he was using Yahoo Messenger for work but you used that system to send\nMessages which would describe as quite intimate to his brother and fiance and they employ ...\n... I think from the u._k. context band ... because it's very rare in the case for\nEmployees to ban past weeks of of what systems completely ... by that you mean music ... ... and ... you can and cannot and will the evidence I think is is just blaring because people recognize your work uh laws so you do need to be able to access\nYour private systems or your private communications from the ... ...\nAnd then this individual and here's what types of the ban on personal ... he used the system to send personal messages they import transcribe them and ultimately dismissed him fool Hayes breach of the employers what place policy saying you couldn't use it personally and he went right up to the\nEuropean Court of human rights and they look to this question of what he says well established principles that\nYour private correspondence county privates even if it's in a workplace context and I looked at this issue about whether the fat balance had been achieved and\nOne of the key things about that case it's an individual hadn't clearly had advance warning\nThat the employer could monitor his communications or could read the contents of them and that's\nYou know one of the key things about getting that balance right he was a case well yes I mean it's quite complicated with that at work ... clearly he did establish that he had some right to privacy but it wasn't an obsolete right it was the mole if everyone else that you should always is\nFair assumption but it's back to the balance I was talking about say\nYou could have seen this an employer might looking set in second stances but the ...\nWhen it might look what a good set of rules of thumb that an employee should stick to when they're using ... communications I think about what you're saying about your colleagues about your customers\nBecause the origins may not just be the recipient said that the mad at maybe your employer you may be a cool thing you need to think about what place to print ... communications\nAnd temperature and ending this edition of business daily that's it from me and the team went back again at the same time\nTomorrow but first I just go to several dozen also work emails to apply to [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "18"}
