have very good reputation many of them I started by women\nAnd women that are about my mom's age which is like fifty five fifty eight years old so they had been in this line for the last Thirty years\nSo I guess being into beauty industry in Singapore we are a little bit fortunate in that way where I Believe that that is a good mix of apologies for women to to be an entrepreneur and to shine and do well as well [noise]\nThe second part on whether or not women um lowly paid and why is that the situation being an industry we do know what is the industry late especially for the front line technicians who are the new deal\nIs the choice of entrepreneur to business owner on how they wanted to structure their wages if you want your employees to be that crammed cram the best employees out there then you have to pay a little bit or not just a little bit or you have to pay above\nThe average not just minimum wage above average and structure compensation system such that they know that they will be compensated for good luck not just in sales and service in technical expertise and we offer a career progression so they know that\nFor example I have got a girl with us I said that mean assistant who now is running my entire kind relations operations team in the last five years she's been five years and that kind of progression would have been very very rare or ... take on how much longer\nBecause the curia professions as one of the one where you don't and I'm just wondering ... in terms of the new business things like maternity leave and paternity leave which tend to be on the nickel for women progressing within the curies how do you personally to deal with that I Would\nDisagree with pulling statement that it's the choice of the entrepreneur or to remove the barrios lowly wages NBC\nBecause when I said to me is I you know I didn't enjoy running this business in those early days is because I felt deeply uncomfortable with paying another go like eight pounds in Iowa it made me feel weird to do that because\nIt just didn't sit right with me thought this is where I disagree with the fact that it's the choices the entrepreneur\nBeauty is not seen as a essential hole a therapeutic old health giving service right [noise]\nSo because the market right for beauty is in finish treatment is no you can't pay higher wages because the economics of you\nSixteen pounds right now for sixteen pounds it takes about an hour so you're taking away the wage the other's heads the cost of goods the cost of ... truck you ... then pay a higher wage so when you were doing you'll cash flow fool custodial balance sheet\nYou'll like how much can I pushed the treatment to pay my team\nA fair wage and then a wall we charge fifty pounds were critics very expensive we have a salon in central London we use the best quality products I saw it on is hygiene make on looks nice and is it generally nice environment to be in\nBut because of all of this we don't make masses of profit because I'm choosing to pay on now technicians fairly there any reason I can make these choices because I've another business and other business prospects in other ways to make money but\nFor the average hassle owner and a\nBeauty salon owner now sell on ... you can't always pay the wage that you would want to pay because the economics don't walk so the white to change this is to change the

you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWhere we the people who need it to that's why if you don't them recording surviving now have you had any interaction with them yes Adam ... they started cutting the pipes I trust and they started cutting you'll pipe yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them would really be or not to be a wife or their children\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk so I was an income that's how it with somebody then these ideally out so well by that is that some times that they found that what we don't have mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that day they said the water there\nThis is Kenny old over he has a run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWith them for two shootings and the friends for ten\nSo you will say it's ... ... and my wife is clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your experience for science yeah so yeah so I I Will to find a way to welcome them where to find a way without too you know to put them part of the system so that's your what's your ... [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] just listening\nTo Kenny how his life story the some makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nAnd and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he's\nStreet smart he's slum ... if you'd like he knows how to operate the yeah I don't want to paint shelf though as a one man band you know Kenny just off one of these I'm doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that ... school like I mentioned and the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife\nAnd for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit last still has a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that ...\nThey said the salaries in line with over ... of a similar size or if things being signed off by the bullets are paying for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment well they're bringing in a lot of money shelf go just wanted to ... million dollar prize\nFrom the Hilton foundation the hotels ... yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with older the what the shelf that does not just the water but there are other projects to ... the only ones who are trying to solve this problem shelf that not the only game in town\nSo lots of different people and organizations thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums and just in Kibera I you know the ... ... email said and I'm thinking one woman she said and Wonder Woman with ... she was said gladiator a few years back if you remember that yeah okay\nWell she runs a foundation that are also dreading bullet holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just ... up and passing it out so they got to walk through the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut as several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes maybe the\nPlayers involved as you said it's a ... fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this bull whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was working with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure out in the slum itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and\nPeople are shocked co in Kenya a bit more fleet to circle you know fast to doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf sky direct grassroots organization that led by ...\nThey didn't wanna hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental man but he said he had invisible Mentos\nMandela mountain that I must be Rosa Parks they see is how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nMen and women were not just sit down and watch when priests from what's happening and what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't sit down and which plants and now that's a good answer for that to be a year come together [noise] you know [laughter]\n\n[noise]\nThank you Sam for them just for you and thank you well tax listeners for wealth listening we hope you can cheat in again next week when will introduce you to another problem solver from another part of the planet [noise]\nAnd if you

students or projects\nAs you move farther into your career it there are paid discrepancies and we started originally just wanting to support front and signatures as we had a pledge and we have that on line still you can read it it's quite nice tell us what the pledges it is an open letter that\nWe wrote as the women in science asking scientists women and supporters of women scientists to stand together and change the face of science as it is today\nHow to take this we have to be a fully funded sustainable organization that continues to push\nTo make science open at Christmas and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists do if five hundred women scientists within America are succeeding than we want to make a five hundred women scientists within all the countries of the world and then five hundred women scientists within each discipline but our preference for Mr Right we can keep moving up and up\nKelly Ramirez that what Kelly and talks are just wait say suggest as a structural problem with science in academia\nBut within the rules are just not as visible last week professor don't a strict and became to a woman to win the Nobel Prize for physics a day later another one from this on those won the Nobel Prize in chemistry\nAnd professor strict in historic achievement\nHer biography was conspicuously absent from the world's fifth most popular website we keep ... apparently she wasn't well known enough so what's going on Rebecca ... is a ... in history of science at the University of can't she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nIt's about how science developed and how it ... find a space within the culture and I'm within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy as it was it was understood in the late seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of ... it wasn't necessarily take the well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to con obese or to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing its own oath already\nOn one of the ways to do that has often been to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being more dangerous or less serious or less intelligent because of the ways that gender roles of being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded where they may once\nOr the absolutely and take me once you get to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public face so women not generally left I tip into public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a masculine kinda ... it's going out and earning a living and so and so when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments and we were talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a a Korean policy can fall I say a a kind of a joke that you could name for weather is training whether all existing sought to society's channels you can publish in\nAnd a roots by which you can expect one living so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite late tone\nAnd by that point when it very much being excluded from those of cheating in historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places that that happens so the relatives averaging granted she's one of those places where you might living by doing scientific work\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing a geological surveys which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding minds exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you're not finding people doing scientific research within you invest states for example so yeah it's really only later on that you get\nThe kinds of scientific Korea that we would understand that if someone's that she paid to do ... to solve a particular problem it's just\nPretty much across the world is the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe I'm ... I'm very much talking about the western European tradition and so what do I get sort of taken up in in America older interesting you they're all more opportunities for women in what is a very new in the best the system in\nSay the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach a strong to be in the women's college so\nThis brings the women I mean partly often it's a sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that that women should be educated and have a more public voice ... hops\nSo we do find women there and the way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in person you've got to look for the Cambridge in England and and women's struggling for very long time to be given places\nThat I've seen the thing that you say that when a field is new and it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I can let it interesting that in when you look at the desk of figures\nOn women in science for example that some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nThose kinds of fish and worst of the lowest ones are the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love to know more about the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing such or are we talking about ... systems\nYou know what is the kind of funding that goes into research with any investigation there's different countries so in some cases\nI suspect there may be longer focusing on women being at higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded and whether a places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly socially prestigious then you tend to find\nWomen funding and opportunity because men are not taking the option to because there are other things that they would rather be doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full say they're a good example and the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so a new kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing they own following the traditional education system they all competing with a lot of established individuals' usually male who publishing in those areas and some interesting late we sometimes find that that gives women in ...\nWhich early on was very much seen as a female role we sort of association with lots of ... old punch cards and things that were often seen as almost secretarial work and I'm not a very narrowly firing euro so you know it wasn't necessarily well paid\nAnd often it was left women to do this but when it was on ... ... to keep teaching was going to be we find that it stopped being paid more seeds being more prestigious and women have them being so slowly shift I filled out\nRebecca get lecturing history of science at the University of can't\nJust how much wouldn't get filtered out was brought home by so the u._k. a few years ago they found that two thirds of the British public\nWas unable to name a single famous female scientist so to end this program we've compiled views women working in stem subjects an awesome to name that stuff female scientists you'll hear new pig every time a name was mentioned [noise]\n\nMy name is real my structural engineer and my engineering hero if and when he wrote that they have to take charge of delivering the Brooklyn Bridge up to his father in law died in an accident on the site and her husband was many many injured she took over hello\n\nThere and my\nMain concern is that she needs development my age [noise]\nBasically designed to how I should not news around and say [noise]\nMy name is Harry Potter experiment is saying we want to get a ... billion times that they can do to get the fundamental building blocks of yeah but\nI like to nominate stuck to somebody on the ... to ...\nI like to highlight kids today they are going to fight showing off his name wheel and she had a passion and carbohydrate rich she was a woman as a prize for medicine shortages okay [noise]\n... some names to amend the next time we're off to us to name a stop female scientist that's it from this business daily maybe you can always get in touch with the program you can send your comments to our Twitter handles at BBC business or at BBC World ... or ... to to handle\nMoney went up BBC does this daily is back getting at the same time tomorrow [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "09"}
