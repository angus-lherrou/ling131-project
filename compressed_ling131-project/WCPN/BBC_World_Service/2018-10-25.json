hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics I asked him about the risks they pose\nA condemn it could trigger a global recession a toll depends how big it is of course and where it's will hits and we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago um reduce global GDP by about five percent speed trillion in these days\nWe know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of sauce really hit the GDP by about closest three percent but it was also an increase by to hundreds base point in the country risk premium so that's another problem so according\nTo the the size of the epidemic we're talking about the damage in terms of trillions nothing billions\n\nThe failure to think beyond finance is the first lesson that has yet to be ... the second is that management and regulations folks some of what's happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n\nIn the u._k. the full separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers of colleagues Oxford University shed the independent commission on banking set up by the u._k. government following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safer\nReason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends then\nNext crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cooled ring fencing so this is the idea\nThe ordinary high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped those coal things which we all this individuals and small businesses depend on which the government can't let for life without titled calamity\nThat those activities in major banks\nShould be in a a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposures to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperil domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some jeopardy so that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the abduction of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentrated in fewer hands in the u._k. is in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bailout the ailing banks and to sweets in terms of the merger with big banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks got even bigger and competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail I mean if they collapsed that would bring down the whole system\nLets implies the government's which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's another ... of the bankers' new clothes\nSize of the largest banks certainly grow\nThat will tell you that they did the favor swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural him nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in market they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they had a privileged existence why they keep getting\nFunding despite being sold risky insult pay their too many protests\nIf you want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your loan\nTo where the measures to prevent the mix financial crisis an improvement as well made them was\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been their first response you know quick solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nGrowing complexity into dependency of the banking system was ... by revolutionary technological changes such as growing computer power\nWhich alone physics and math graduates to build financial products which the top bosses let alone the regulators politicians and customers do not understand\nFall from reducing an offsetting risk innovations we're raising and spreading it\nI think we were told that all these innovations and that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about\nClever ways to hide or asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily useful for society so yeah it's some level you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy was spent in justifying things that are not that great and in a void being discussion of all day\nSubtle way some times in which the public was deceived do miss sold and older misconduct that goes on in this industry\n[noise] as the pace of technological changes accelerated this concern has become more acute and increasing\nSharing credit with very little regulation oversight [noise] new cyber currencies such as bitcoin also typically avoid the regulate tree rate up as a meeting of new technology innovators\nI may have it so God of electric capital which trades digital currencies he told me that it's no accident that corner rose immediately after the\nFinancial crisis as it's aimed to build a financial system without relying on will being supervised by\nThe discredited government authorities\nDeclined was launched into has an eight and it was very much catalyzed by the failure financial system fundamentally the words intermediary trust\nTrust lesson is these are the terms that you see recurring and and the original decline my paper and it's because fundamentally what happened in two thousand aid is we realized that the system was predicated on trusting these very large and powerful intermediaries\nAnd one of the intermediaries fail the entire system fails with it that collapse indicated not only that the system itself has\nSome critical design flaws that got the ball going in terms of thinking about what a system might look like they could not have those fairly\nRecent years have shown that bitcoin and other digital currencies let on not issued by central banks suffer from many of the same failings as other currencies in fact they've been subject to even more volatility and fraud\nBitcoin advocates and other new technology firms typically like to convince us that the new technologies or force for good\nBut the financial crisis highlighted the extent to which technology can be both a friend\nAnd the folk technological change can bring great benefits but it also can be a source of mayhem which amplifies risk the same technologies which would allow me to communicate this program with listeners around the world and for you to disseminate through social media could be used\nThe crisis arose\nBecause decision makers were blinded by blizzard of information [noise] finance is highly dates are intensive industry or to his credit rating agencies banks and regulators reduced everything to numbers [noise]\nAs the volume of Trump's actions group and computing power increased more and more data was being crunched and economists were able to build models using ever bigger data sets and yet relying on the states it proved to be increasing the inadequate\nAs decision makers were overwhelmed with information and I'm able to disturb what matches from the fire hose of data\nDirected at them [noise]\nBusiness and political leaders are meant to be paid for that judgment thinking and intuition\nThe evidence shows they relied on badly interpreted big data and groupthink and when the system collapsed they took refuge and blaming others it nevertheless seems amazing to me that so many clever people got it so wrong\n\nYou're listening to the inquiry on the b._b._c. was service with me and then to marry
