[laughter]\nGood about the argument put when it's just that\nIt comes down to the fact that that's where it's perfect working older about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that and to repair it was a real hair it been ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour legs and say we're going to put them in the world this is a slower process has been no I've already been out for and how to look in\nWe should really be doing things to reuse things but it comes down to ... county is designed says secrecy did um than you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if the new company is going to be generally cheap and unable to quit when I Need a better job [noise]\nSo there are a couple of issues the rise to wind up in a pound of people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy they just don't have the time\nYeah obviously a people loved pretty busy day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around\nUh who are very conscious about did and vitamin ... that's ... ... we get in some parts we get very equal just phones because people want to do that bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they had actually doing a lot of their thoughts so that things don't go to lunch and\nMust you know I Wonder if you could just kind of address that issue or some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe you you would kind of preaching to the compared to the head for reasons because you know they're already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people have you ... the other people who\nAs we heard from the people look at the tip you are quite happy just to throw stuff or\nThat's the challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack I say when they have something that they really want to hang on to win when it's a fresh is broken object that cannot be\nIf they don't really expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind [noise]\nTowards a more sustainable society\nPolitical running show some time now this RIMPAC cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing a machine that pulled apart as a chapter with a large Sean and get him into the workings of the device some fun with them from everybody ... Martinez West is thought to be in ten Fifteen Years time\nWell I think that will be more repack I face because they'll they'll they'll be needed\nBut we also hope that's manufacturers realized that product should be re bearable and that they should be a produced in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired inappropriate way\nAnd maybe you might have a three D. prints are in in in ... so you could principal suspect pause to to fix things and you don't have the baseball strikes away that movie challenging but um maybe in the future you love that Christmas you [noise]\nOh yes I mean I think the future of RIMPAC I face is as much\nAround bringing people together and I think coming to RIMPAC cafe yet it does create that sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships I'm kind of slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider role to play than simply connecting broken items with Paris hits it hits connecting people with each other [noise]\n[noise]\nMy thanks to everyone to most Tina I'm Patrick Harris but some to Chris in London and Chevy ... in Bangalore thank you for this thing too well time if you want to see ... cafe in action and making a video from ... so it it will be there soon\nOh I Know I'm going to ...

but also Britain's home secretary the thumb since bank down on his campaign ethics direct to Henry James admitted a bit of a mistake that but she said the campaigns will not about to stop\nObviously we took a huge amount of backlash which you know they had a personal cost to us enough stuff about the same time it called the she talked about in the u._k. ... been talked about before so I guess that in some ways we just have to view the emotional impact on us as collateral damage to the greater good\nYou have all kinds of campaigns not just that one of course campaigns ... animal testing you both campaigns have a phobia trends phobia fracking Fox hunting nuclear issues plastic packaging the list\nGoes on how does that relates to selling both products\nOr what we try not to relate to it just having passed products because all the states they she said you just mentioned the things that we will cap I'm passionately ... did before we became a company that made\nSense we were all campaign as an activist before we came and went to a lush and that includes the people who started last so obviously there's a whole host of things that we will care of that and we built a business

your say oh I can\nTell you that one because actually surprisingly it puts sales op\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was guessing all the negative publicity\nYes yes during the spike up campaign and yet it wasn't our campaigns people it was actually our accounts people came to us and you may defend called and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know entangled in that because that because any news is good news\nI think it's cause any news is good news or I Would hope that what it was was a customer standing by us that they were really literally holding all hands through it and saying you know it's okay with you we know what you do we know why you do it and we're going to keep shopping with you know we don't care if you mess up\nAnd we don't care if you mess up sometimes\nI mean I I get what you're saying and I get the thing's a heartfelt and do you separate the two things I I suppose I'm Still slightly struggling to understand why you'd be bothered with even trying to sell soap or other products 'cause my sex if your campaigns are served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why marry the two in the first place\nI guess we marry the two because we've built this huge brand we're on high streets around the world and it would be
