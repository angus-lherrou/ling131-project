I spoke to do to lose left in the statistician with Georgia Tech school mathematics to find out why you would have to be very very lucky\nThe mega millions is a ... a lottery that crosses most of the United states there is about\nI think maybe four states that are not included so it's really almost like a a national lottery in the U.S where people buy a ticket or two dollars and they choose one special number out of twenty five and then five other numbers out of Seventy\nAnd if they match all six numbers they'll win the jackpot is one point six billion assuming no one else chooses the same number [noise] and the winners will get their share after taxes or a\n... I'm going to go out on a limb here in suggests that if I buy one ticket miles on winning up ...\nThat's correct in fact your odds of winning or I'm exactly one in three hundred and about one in three hundred and two million and that's true no matter what the jackpot sizes\nBut win the jackpot ... gets large then more people buy because they they're just imagining themselves those billionaire\nSo even if no one in three hundred million short comes off that possibly others who will be sharing it with me 'cause most people have signed up for a ticket\nCorrect I Believe the the lottery commission has said that they expect Seventy five percent of all possible combinations to be purchased by tomorrow so there's a pretty good\nThat's a I think it's pretty likely someone will win well or or possibly many people will when depending on how the how the numbers law\nWould it technically be possible to buy some many tickets that you would guarantee yourself a victory\nIn principle you couldn't buy all possible combinations but in practice it's impossible there are\nThree hundred million combinations and the tickets cost two dollars each so if you had six hundred million dollars that's the first obstacle [laughter] and then uh you wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion dollars\nBut the trick of course is you're not guaranteed that you'll be the only winning tickets so you're jackpot might be cut in half instantly or even further if there's multiple winners\nAnd I spent some time to share logistics of buying that many tickets underneath the\nAbsolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation or you will find that\nEven if you have somebody going out of all possible numbers in a certain range\nAbout one ticket every ten seconds\nYour mind one person might be able to fill out about ten thousand tickets between now and win the lottery is drawn but you need to fill up three hundred million so you're going to need to hire a thirty thousand people and I ...

I'm\nKimmy talks about repeat to listening\n... yeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you almost it's subliminal you know you know it's like yeah you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with ... you know if you can't the problem is sometimes you get a chalk and I like\nCan you get as a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little tricky because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging who knows\nI recently pitched on the ... is a B and C and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in that ... busy schedule I'm not sure that had time to talk to [laughter]\nSo I just had to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success Tonight Show\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because\nI feel there's a lot of direct it out there is the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on\nEasing artists but then I think I'm looking for something to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then then again it's not Jay Z Beyonce\nYou're listening to the conversation ... to ... music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you Bruce operating at a level where many of the artist he worked with on huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think Kenny specific examples where you have to navigate accommodating to sit and watch and holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points with somebody when something a little bit differently so just in does yeah\nYou gotta understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way 'cause I mean I have to put myself and especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jobs going to make because it is a male dominated field and that ... the editor cross all starting off\nOn television so I was the printing person that now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had\nWas every time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony that I was one of them and they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do we get is not like you know I'm the director now it's like yeah I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that and I remember just from one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be a visual as possible\nAnd I sent it to the guy that you know was running the show and he called me like I was like actually love this treatment and bite off your and like that in the\nI call this one and I needed to make it\nNeeds to execute this project and you can't get a better job because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that got that Charles eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't habits is that I looked it up the part I might not have gotten long boosted tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to you know a lot of people call me they don't even while I'm a girl so [laughter] because they just need a music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kinds of you know how they ... you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things on charges that things are charging ... um their\n... their partners like I'll give you their projects that I Do for nothing at all but that would have made me the most money when they came to me my budget it was a little bit too much for them I really loved the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nThat particular project might not have\nLied my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people have seen that and gone I needed to work in this project right for them with\nThe next thing is going to be given today I mean what they can get ... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much you are challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because it does a rule of thumb that older actors get ten percent of budget\nIs it what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of a budget which would allow you to ... hundred thousand US dollars and we can be about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be it can be Eva let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand\nAre working at a supermarket [laughter] because as a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempest and what does that mean ten percent of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label\nCan get in your experience how a male and female artists treated differently by they record labels\nWell in my experience and is obviously general conversation and doesn't apply to everybody of what we buy it really depends on the oddest and like how much they already have to bring to the table but if it's somebody who used to be young and like a little bit lost and not the shore and that super talented and have an amazing voice and\nMaybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with other writers so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more women than men\n\nComing up after Denise it's wild ... we're talking about people who can play

I get stuck in those sorts of places I've been stuck in St Louis and had to look at the same job of peaches for about twenty minutes [laughter] and I've been stuck on and the station in London vacancy station for an hour and a cruel to them because I couldn't get on the train\n... power she was diagnosed with ...\nYeah they they are very scary however health ... London thinks they might have come up with a solution to get people not mountain moving again the solution\nRubber divide that goes around to if the shoe underneath and then often around the he'll\nDot ... sets up ... with a company that create devices that help people with the general newer logical disorders so we've got the product [laughter] yeah\nAnd I mean for started it's more shave no it's not if the shoe attachment\nDirectly strap is only used as a mechanism for securing the actual books which is on the top of that so ... says she's talking about quite high tech there about the science for much books and there's one on each for now when you switch them on a laser beam projects on the ground\n... green line a few inches in front of each but who has a guy I Try and get on and say how ... I'm Sorry to max ... should I get up and I have a walk and then you can guide me as to\nWhy should be placed in them so this is who'd been reading straight food which I've ... I've said to the\n... I'm On my she is um how that changes coming out as much\nYou can see when you put your left foot on the ground it will have the nation from dry food has found that the less than a lot\nOf strength will come after office with ISIS cut me off my feet\nTo the places they switch on and off as you take each step forward yes so when I put my right foot forward a small horizontal line about ten cents\nBut I'm Wondering how they help people who have freezing of gate happy so\nYes so behind the solution is not just sneeze she works closely with professor ... blue ... who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and and you're on the just the\nEssence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called automatic pilot\nUm is defective if people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it that automatic obesity is lost and people with Parkinson's\nBut you can actually literally trick the brain by by policy that automatic pilot which is more or less to start engine of the brain by consciously recruiting demoted areas of the brain so what the lasers basically do is offer an external visual trigger\nForcing or allowing to patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they buy pause there defective automatic pointed\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the will to my way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way yeah another\nReally good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues will kept the style as\nDust because the status going up woods acts as a visual cue obstruction by policies that effective power fight the sensory illusion of delays as walks in the same way it tricks the Brian by constantly placing a key\nAnd from out as we had a bad idea has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets and Raul way stations this device is pretty useful if I can\nMoving so I Will have to pulling my leg some holding like putting it around the corner for dragging myself along the the units\nAnd then they get to the capital and I can't stand up straight to fill it in the capital and I'm guessing from the capital to this the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then to have to going to get the milk when I forgot to take it with me\nIs also exhausting but with the shoes on it's still hard what but it makes it possible to do the things instead of on the impossible [noise]\n\nSounds like in these issues than have\nPeace of mind yet she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that you can get out of a freezing I showed if she knows it's going to happen\nHowever there are still occasions where episodes suddenly come on without warning\nSometimes I Do cross quite badly and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be there's nothing I can do except wait for the medication to what the name and\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and by ... move a call ... the mom and she says they're all of a limitation says well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven stuff is like the grass all that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surfaces flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that\nI imagine a calm the very easy to see delays is on a sunny day\nYeah mount did mentioned to me that when she goes in ... in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she ... lasers on soft one of the drawbacks and she felt a independent not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible outdoors\nSo it's not a perfect solution from out buddy help so\nSun says participants off medication and when they were on medication effect was still positive is the decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent however that was a really small sample size only Nineteen participants in our study\nThat smoke and I wonder how do these you know do they make a stand out they do a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in one of the uh the motives of this why someone in the Netherlands ... on a trade money caused a lot of panic people food it was a weapon well from what I understand what puff have rarely\nRefined the production center address some of those concerns but it is who is going to generate attention wearing ... she's in public and they chose attention to something people might otherwise one to be quite prize about\n[noise]\nSo these two ideas duck pool and later she both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act differently in my own way we can treat the brain so I ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area of what's happening is wearable tech startups like ... she's\nA kind of tracking you're a scientist a lapse and that means that the solutions are reaching the real world a lot quicker previously they would have been but a lot for a long time\nSo it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of start ups and you're a scientist and professors and you are scientists who have been speaking to you have said that it's very likely we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nThis and I think thank you ... and things to all of you for listening to all tax\nEmail is ... hats asked BBC does see all the u._k. we'll be back next week with another mind bending finishing to can you hang around and feel that the buying\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

number of major sporting goods stores that said that they wouldn't no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they wouldn't no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these movies\nHard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impacted the n._r._a. finances\nWe know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents but it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting effects of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the n._r._a. spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less on candidate\nOctober show that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the n._r._a. for this ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we'll say failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies who withdrawal mess up off the n._r._a. but we did reach one candidate base for them that was caught up in all of these protests David led the stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment ...\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was studying some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nThere was a petition and to us that had some fifty thousand signatures on it but what we were really watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was evident that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this\nAnd we believe that we have to take action based on what we were seeing and what we are following primary and our social media channels [noise]\nSo what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and really trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were long\nKenyan vendors off our shoes ethics we're close to two hours and then ... the holding company\nSo they were very round people um that we're supposed to be aligned to us that would have been impacted by our decisions\nRight so it would mean a centrally uh with the the probably move you made right was to to to stop selling on your shelves products made by that\nDoes manufacture those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey make up for sale I don't think it's been sold yet\nI'm just making observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves goes up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that we look to censor the ... this was a social decision for us not a political id ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S and his former politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moved like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the ... campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but professor Bob Spitzer doesn't think financial muscle is key to the n._r._a. influence anyway\nThe key thing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money\nSo much as it has been the zealous loyalty of its base of gun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend a meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call attended demonstration when most Americans stay home in two thousand Seventeen for example\nThe n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities in the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nTo the un arrays fine than swimming alone despite its claims of\n... well the ... does have money problems they spent a whole lot of money in two thousand sixteen election cycle that gave thirty one million dollars\nRussian sources that's the dark allegation reported on in the American media in recent months and their difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older white male and that generation is frankly dying off\nBack in the Nineteen sixties one household into had at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there even though fewer Americans own and have guns the average number of guns owned by gun owners has increased today the average gun owner owns more than eight\nSo let's hear from them rich and Mary Wilcox oh too long to gun owners\nThey live in a rural area and the opening in New York state where they've seen a steady rise in local government restrictions on firearms and ammunition sales they let a reporter skilled at the ... into the house to see some of the many weapons they keep\nThe first one is a three oh wait that would be for deer hunting bear New York state has quite a population of bears and they're actually starting to get to be a problem because there's too many of them might pistols there that's a forty caliber and this one here with my great grandfather's gun purchased in Eighteen Ninety\nIt's more of a buffalo gun for shooting Biden\nHe sound like cited when he comes home and the deer and it's really neat what we can have for dinner as a result of that it's just amazing\nAnd especially like venison with here it's very very low cholesterol because they're wild animals do not like a cow that's eating grass not doing anything all day long I in my lifetime member of the n._r._a. I've been a member of the an array for Thirty years they support\nJust recently just shot somebody in their home in the area that like a burglary yeah they broke somebody broke into their house and I literally carry my pistol all the time so and it's loaded for this reason for that reason security\nWhat that does is by me having the gun it gives me a choice if I Need to protect myself or my wife or my family I can do that\nAnd if you look at your biggest crime rates in cities are in cities that don't have guns\nLike Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country they have the toughest gun laws in the country\nTighter gun control it's like you guys for how'd you guys see that\nI think it's a waste I mean they're really chasing the wrong rabbit on this thing it's not a gun problem\nIt's a mental health problem education problem it's\nSociety's problem I mean when I was a kid people brought their guns to school you go to school to be guns and hanging in the back windows of the car or the trucks that had shooting classes in school\nAnd nobody got shot like they did okay nothing it's it's more of a mental health thing it's more of a societal thing than a gun problem so you agree or they're going to outlaw guns and the only ones who are going to have guns are outlaws\nThey're making criminals out of every day people I mean I don't have a problem with regulating guns and controlling who has them but you can't\nYou can't just blame blatantly said no nobody can have them because then you're going to end up with just the\nBad guys having guns rich and Mary Wilcox from a town called water for New York state well they may be a golf as all the new anti gun measures that they're seeing but this could just be the tip of the legislative iceberg at least according to care Linda us think progress\nIs a critical midterm election this year and I think we have candidates are running this year specifically on a platform of gotten safety and we have a candidate outside of choice I named Lucy McBath\nShe decided you know what if I Want a candidate who's going to support the type of gun reforms that I Do it should just be me and she is not the only one with the candidates like this across the country I think the environment in the United states is different this year than what we've seen in the past\nHaving voters energizing galvanize over something like diamonds will help candidates at all levels I think was the effects all across the ...\n... one of course going control is just one small issue affecting voters choices in the upcoming midterms in tomorrow's business daily we're going to be looking in more detail of what has been a record breaking year for us electoral fundraising what difference does all this money\nActually make to the final election joined me same time tomorrow", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "23"}
