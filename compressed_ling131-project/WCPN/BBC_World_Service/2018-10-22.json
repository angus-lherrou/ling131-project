head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class and what we're seeing on the news I suppose banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very ... and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on we're not learning the in our class\nThat was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis\nAnd the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession and have become windy column is the most widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must stumped subjects that we huge Lee important in terms of understanding the crush\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way on that correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches that in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think that was true not just about that of many others\nI mean if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms\nRemember these are the people who graduate I'm going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend\nIf they give bad advice and can wreck your economy the growing frustration felt by students and the teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one

the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment sets in tire early unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system and does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more about you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really\nNot quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nNot much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy

citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd\nMiss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things in the self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nNotion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior\nThe banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation others didn't the ...\nDuring the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country [laughter]\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem with the hearts of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were a

to see ourselves\nBased on that I agree with Katrin Schumann that people are simply rational neglect key die mentions of what makes us human and that this was an important reason why Columbus to fail

the bread the factors that influence decisions she's expecting too much of economics or indeed any discipline to incorporate all aspects of human behavior the growing depth and breadth of knowledge requires more specialized nation but to understand how to tackle real world problems more into this marriage is required\nThe financial crisis happened in my view not because the tools didn't exist in economics to understand what was happening but because the wrong tools we used\nAnd challenging questions were not being asked to individuals and institutions inside and outside economics discipline

went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy and law at New York University He is a gay man who was married to his partner have more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on the vision we use race religion and the class to separate us from then increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict and hate\nSo is there an end to this preoccupation with group on tribe\nWell Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now\nWelcome to talk to the beer\nYou have spent a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves\nSo let's start with a simple question how do you label you also\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half\nA gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's the that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nFires are you thinking that you're sending signals to go into lucky to er about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals from a faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as\nI think many people assume uh they they will so I I grew up and got on my father was going to end but that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am in God or it doesn't tell you how much I never got us since I haven't lived after that he is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if if at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in in all of your work on the race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we're role so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply is in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take all the big labels the you know the race religion nationality I'm even toss in all of those there's so much diversity within them\nThe ... you know men are also ... met another all the same man is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain are different from one another people in London a different from one another and a million ways\nSo that being told that somebody's a London it doesn't actually give you a huge grip on or anything are very important about them which doesn't mean that there are moments when ... isn't hugely important that people\nUm there're Merrill elections it's important to be if you're a London that when when the mayor is being elected if that were big as they have been in the past the terrorist attack in London that would bring them together they have a sense that okay we're all facing this together um\nThe current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nAnd it does so but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately are not ... I Believe that they should jak tree of the human condition\nThen compassionate humanity I guess how can you square that with what you see well uh\nI I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years or ten or twenty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respects or in many ways over the last century I'll say for example\nThink about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to ask people in many many countries over the last century look at the massive\nReduction in a racial\nOr discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing coming together of Europe at the same moment to these moments of nationalism\nAnd putting fax it to one side which one has to do um Europe ... is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century\nSo uh or even in the mid ... centuries I think older they say if you look over long enough horizon\nYou can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nArea where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in in the western world\nAh societies and cultures view a gender issues in particular sexuality I mean your your your uh uh a known for very long time in out gay man you took advantage of America's change of the laws that that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go with the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways that we never even thought of before not just in terms of\nOf sexuality but even in terms of of basic gender where now there is a a very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who define themselves as known binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be\nThe ... there are two things at the report about where it doesn't that doesn't end with the disappearance of identity we are reforming our justice system but by not getting rid of gender altogether I I can ... I Believe that I live alone all into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between now\nAnd there's the question is where the self identity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm lurching between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on how to not so long ago we spoke to a woman code ritual does though who\nIs white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and on and live a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black well\nI think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between ... and and and others I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of the euro and rice all on their own race has a special category you need to\nSee if you if you don't like where it's but you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel ... didn't do which is they\nCreated a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be in our system they've asked us to change the system I'm not I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if they did a little bit of how do I am asking them the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nA fragile they'll they'll have could have provided\nActually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments living it that way\nIs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other people just to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you'd have been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society is simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens and I I get that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nI think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat's the thing the ones that can full so that I think some things can be said a but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is so close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less than people did that so don't allow yourself\nTo be channeled off into a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among\n'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people live all the major kinds and do things with them that's not about race or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nUm you know building something in the community to get to work together with people because I think working together with people to divest identities\nBadly I'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and the ... and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nThe final thought we have a a thinker and writer in the United kingdom come David good heart who said that these days the most\nImportant distinction and identity that that one can use when looking at people in western society is is between those he calls\nAnyway as a ... some ways now the anyways other highly educated usually metropolitan highly immobile people who are comfortable\nIn an open intellectual environment living pretty much anywhere in our own country or indeed in the world that would be you and then there's some way as on deeply rooted people who are not so immobile whose fault persist as a small localized not so open\nAnd then they according to David good hot I'm much less interested in the kind of\nIdeals that you've just been painting with me\nAm happy to live in the world with the somewhere as I just don't want them shaping the will to the rest of us in a way that makes us it very difficult for us to do what we want to do so if my my favorite example this is the American example of the Amish in Pennsylvania\nThey close themselves off they don't like talking to strangers and they don't like money they don't like the guys like lots of things that I think I was never as sort of inevitable Boston London will and they've made a well to themselves I think they're entitled that I Believe I Believe that that that that freedom is a simple as anybody else's freedom\n... and they don't do any harm to the rest of us they go into the well campaigning against the other state just live separately I don't mind that I think if you want to be somewhere like that that's fine\nBut if you want to be the kind of somebody who wants to take over the United states or Britain and turn it into a country of somewhere as a than I Am a on the other side from you I I I'm a live and let live kind of person I Am just\nOh so ... so it's a lovely place that I can imagine a puffer decent life or living there are all the time mostly hanging out with people from as you're not just it's not the life that I've
