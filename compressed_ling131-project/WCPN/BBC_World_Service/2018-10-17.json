the game it's done I think I'm I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to sort of cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing and\nBring to the game and willing to buy that season policy and that's how the

money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software of Fort Night\nThat's what they're basically accusing these papers copyright infringement and they're saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that for all you have spoiled it essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one there surely at the

you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think epic haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps they're trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will\nBe and it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nItself is not even a fuss for Fortnite re vote yeah they they had some people arrested I think and I'm a ... this is a different game actually paranoid and bustle

the counter here um there are about three locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street and by the candidates\nBut for for now for the most part you'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that control the sale of liquor and dies they brought in all the rules and regulations companies had to fly\nIn order to be able to sell it legally there are about twenty two locations off in a in the country right now that can ... or so in the process right now they can sell it\nAnd they will pay an excise tax the government for a while it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies\nHave their eye on this already and we've got in first that if the big companies that already um that had already set down on a ... put down roots than other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move and midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you'll see the\nWhole I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight is it's quite amazing though I Would imagine across the country if you look at large\nAnd to be prime minister of the country he promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers adds up\nAnd regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at Canada to see what Canada is going to do because Eric way is the only other country in the world that\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within safe but Canada Israeli a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on hold it will not be without bumps that pick up\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there's even an ... marijuana that's the one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect the demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of the flyers are probably going to run out even within the first day right\nIs it because it's such a stampede the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but people will have to take it and bring it home or take it in and looked at

fourteen billion dollar deal has been signed that Davis of our business desk is here with us now match is just Thirteen year old project finally good at going to get off the drawing board and actually make some money\nIt certainly looks like at the English three hydroelectric projects as being delayed many many times but now deal who's been signed so last year the deal the government ought to compete\nSo yes and now it looks like a deal between those three ... pious as being penned\nAnd it's been many being delayed and his had all sorts of goes I mean it's been a long time coming two years ago the world bank of froze the displacement of Seventy three million dollars of aids cash that it was putting into a helpful technical assistance because it said\nThat country had taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been agreed\nTo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how big it is it's\nHuge um I mean the idea for the Angus three is to compliment the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from Kinshasa near the anger fools\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as a Jew or it's got six faces and\nWe'll take more than ten years to ... compete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred ... megawatts of power now that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China\nDoes the DR see neater used that much power as\nWell as it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal if he can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for economic growth and also be a boost for the country's ... province in the southeast this is where will they mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nAnd it also means that the deal sea can be a big power export to to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south as South Africa which has actually already signed an agreement to take power from the industry project\nHuge prospects then for the are

comes to that whole issue of migration the notion of collective you action it's just not happening\nNot yes but the pressure would have to be in that direction\nAnd the change and Europe needs to do more on that the reason why is a land those who've been at the forefront of receiving migrants are angry as they say in Europe has a ... and then\nThe third point is that the number of migrants coming to Europe has dramatically decreased but wasn't very worrying if you have any concern about human beings is that a woman in a scene die so what so for Asian arrivals one person dies has died in the first couple of months of this year that is a horrific statistically\nFecal matter how the arguments about what to do and they soon increase unity buying the arguments of the fall right where I went

they're going to do because\nFrankly when it comes from the European elections the Brits won't be voting that around your polling evidence suggests that Mr so dreamy that Marine Le Pen's party and farms with a whole host of foreign policies and countries as far as Poland Hungary Austria you name it they have the political momentum\nBut very few are very adamant but very at the weekend\nWith the greens that actually about the surprise\nIf you like the gas or as and and there are new tickets coming up Wednesday you should watch out for them but the mood across Europe definitely politics is polarizing I chaired the European Parliament and increasingly when I called votes you see that the extremes on the right and left vote the same way on issues so it's not just about ideology here there's something is happening\nIn ... in the body politic I mean I Would worry about whether the central can hold or seen the Social Democrats quite fractured\nROTC ... Christian Democrats that could be quite\nA bit of you to the the the mainstream blow yesterday ... paying the Europeans so\nBrussels elites who have not delivered I Know\nThat when you see you're using the language which field a referendum here and quite frankly it becomes a bit tedious I may I may have aged since I got elected but I'm not tired\nLooking for him you might want to leave out actually happens in Hungary until this is reality I don't I Know all\nOf that is reality but my job is not to give in to a reality that I Believe would be bad for my children and I have four of them and in fact I warned them I say to them you have taken for granted pay some this confidence\nBecause it's there nothing is a given on my biggest worry and I do send them what they sometimes is that we will squander what the European Union\nDid which was developed peace and prosperity on the continent of Europe for the idea that you can have your own individual policy or you can be a populist when when you have to do is say something but not take the responsibility for us I take responsibility for what I Do and what I say\nAnd I hope that in the European Parliament elections we talk about Europe and not national issues because they tend to be a button\nAnd I appreciate you'll historical perspective but here's a quote from a man widely respected around your Pasco learning from a commission without change and reform\nThe eating you will remain as it is today in his view irrelevant to a majority of its citizens get out as much strolled narrowly worry and coming from Europe file\nIt is worrying I mean you can wear yourself to death he used to do something with us I mean the first part where he's saying reform and he says 'cause that's essential I mean the thing about being a rather than just hold on a second\nIn art and for example many of us took for granted the single market customs and without understanding what's meant since breakfast right across Europe because of the debate people are beginning to understand the ... the customs union\nHow drugs or regulation chemicals are banned if they're if they're dangerous I mean Europe has done that have pets can be brought on how it is the smallest to the largest\nIn the good times and you're right to focus on all of that and that it is difficult and needs to be challenged because that's my job to do that but it not time it's no harm to remind people that went down to the European Union probably my country pay we would not be at the table but we had he's getting back on have a word and I think we will be in a much more difficult to orange\n... we have to end the thing that you very much for your\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

issue is trying to make that happen for a long period of time since you are and some rain just the\nProfessor Steve right well pioneers in the industry say these limitations could yet be fixed a new generation of batteries and the next year or two\nCould double flying time all the same some of those involved in driving the new tech like engineering box of star top vertigo era uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWe're working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers to not have to design for the batteries of now\nProxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft some of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across\nNew York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nWhere you have maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types then grows\nWe took about taxis I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from\nFact you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been all of a sudden they have ... regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the self Palo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on tops of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city busy business people five to ten times a year and\nWe all find ourselves in the cities where okay my flight was late getting in and I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there are now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this resolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi\nYou're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport two two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nThey're really for the new tech will be when these flying drones but come\nOn just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people let you we'll meet well some Seventy or eighty stocks opposite battling to develop the hard way I'm ride sharing tech them ...\nAlso is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure and lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job in galvanizing the industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is while it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but really but realistic\nOr you know people would argue with the the realism but even if they're close you know there are still gonna be people that have a meeting across town and there's gonna be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big busy city to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe in America who is going to start somewhere else about the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it's just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of Iowans to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of the a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\n... says it's hoping to pilot flying\nActually a realistic shut you give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the University of the west of England well is this the worry first time we have an accident which can be attributed to machine\nAs you can imagine people kind of lose their mind to face and say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and that's providing pulls facility for us in the industry back in the seventies I think they used to be\nA helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then I flipped over and killed ... people and\nThey're not really done it since have they oh what's the Pan Am building wasn't the weather's a helicopter crash that that was cool like us and say again we have problems in developing these these technologies but oddly enough this is one area in which the technology actually sells the problem we've had in the past\nI think the the ... that will pay an easing in period way the public needs to get used to the idea\nTo just in the same way that we had the\nThe the person walking in front of the car waving a red flag whether that's\nWhether that's I ever actually happened I Know that was the early days of ... early days it makes it most of vehicles exactly we a if a if a law and we need to get these two ideas and so once said to be Paul solve our
