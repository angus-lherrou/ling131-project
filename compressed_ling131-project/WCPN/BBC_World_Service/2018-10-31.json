I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context\nIf you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time with the birth rate in their states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today\nAnd that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part\nOf population change in the United states in that era if you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is\nIf you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy than the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks\nWho come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration is important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nAnd the classic American narrative that is of the panelists immigrant who arrives to seek a new life on through hard work and determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to leave a chump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nYou look at the history of integration and how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was\nRestricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship and image grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship and there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narratives and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth that would imply\nWhite immigrants it's such a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHas applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen to the early twentieth century of large European immigration where this oppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states has a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who are coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there is not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean period in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European no there have even more recent on\nThat doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming\nOur gentle and clear that you're on a different and the

population to adapt to change it calling me what's needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is changing to one that's founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for all of the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people of color who are providing those services\nProfessor of either Chomsky at Salem State University and in case you're
