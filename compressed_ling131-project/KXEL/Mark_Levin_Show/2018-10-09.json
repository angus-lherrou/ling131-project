I I guess I guess the point that I'm asking\nIs is it in ... and ... is\nThe Republicans are the majority one can the Democrats you that's that's why is that there are and what would be a ... ... ... that's what I mean it's bad for Democrats or what is their issue that they can use their point\nThere is well what would there be how do you spend a good economy because what else matters to people what else matters if you're going to work every day you got a solid job and possibly even offers on the table\nWhoa yeah\nThis is so dumb that doesn't ... doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't care about the credits\n[noise] they don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them at the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about the past raising the mandate right ... percent right well if you do that that becomes say that becomes a big problem politically ... outside of Iowa\nCould I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it but it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them\nI'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do\nRight and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I won't be the largest cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog what gas\nStations going to be the first to put wanna put eight Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know of of the faster you could damage your lawn mower faster\nIf you use e Fifteen mhm right that it should just be the ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it so is this the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIs trying to appease the farm\nBut you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work\nEven with changing because changing it to sell it year round\nHow does that bent to benefit those that are blending at well okay you could blend it year round and you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often as not that's not promising to them because ultimately it automatically comes back down\nTo the consumer right so the mandate is on the blend here's my question if the mandate is on the ... right at ten per se but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent\nBut those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting an outlet to say they responded to the incentive of of changing the credits\nAnd we went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or the gasoline soul would would have a Fifteen Percent or ethanol concept on the market what would happen with the consumer\nMany of the consumers would be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temporary\nWhen that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have the time this is why it is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate\nAnd he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get any Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get Chuck Grassley on board [laughter] to help you ...

[laughter]\nSorry Mr Trump pointed and Maine do start the story for you but a vow I did it I mean I when I read it I'm thinking well this doesn't do anything in your yeah does if see a Fifteen that is banned in the summer months um they do have even a Fifteen out there there is some out there but as it is not is not mandate it\nWell the the question is is that\nIf the city's believe like Los Angeles\nOr states like California who through the California air resources board I could see them coming in because you know a Houston and and Los Angeles compete or for the number one ah a spot in terms of the smoggy is city\nOr they don't want the eight Fifteen on the market they're not going to want to eat Fifteen on the market which is an interesting position to be [laughter] they can blame Al Gore by the way for this this whole thing um but the [laughter] in part but the\nThe problem is ultimately they won't want more smog they don't they will try and I'm or could try and move way ahead of it even if they don't believe it's going to fly they would probably want to get ahead of it legally\nBy going after the EPA or if the rule or exemption is but here's your here's a difference and as a president going to come out tomorrow and say I'm doing this because of global warming\nWhy I don't know why you know he's not doing\nIt on a rice helping to farmers right where we're how we're helping them Chuck Grassley [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nBut they're not mandating that you buy Fifteen Percent there well making it available where you could do it year round well there even though I don't I I I don't expect anyone\nTo sell something when it's going to be promoted instantaneously if it comes to fruition after tomorrow and you're going to see a bombarded all over the Internet over newspapers it ever was mandated number one that would be fury right or as especially from members of of of Congress\nBut he's not doing it because of global warming he's doing it because he's he's doing it because of a\nMachine to to help the farmer right right which we send to begin with that's not how you run industry you know what I mean setting ten percent mandates to begin with because the president's made it clear you know he I think he would do a mandate mhm and had taxpayer subsidized more just to help the farmers an economy shouldn't run that\nWay well and volcanic he knows he can't get that mandate done right now at least a politically outside of those ... states eight six six Ninety ...

was from\nAugust of this year for the wall Street Journal the daily diary of the American dream\nIs to Portland, Oregon a mob surrounding ice officers in southwest Portland June nineteenth they barricaded the exits and block the driveway they send code guards unquote to patrol the doors working for antifa trapping federal workers inside\nAt night they laid on the street to prostate stopping traffic at a critical junction near a hospital\nPolice stayed away under the orders of the idiotic mayor Ted Wheeler\nBut this time I'm denying your requests for additional resources so the mayor the Portland police bureau pretty cheap Robert de wrote to federal officials under direction of the mayor Ted way clerk dumped sorry Ted Wheeler who's a real clown and so the federal workers\nWere locked inside the federal building cars and tape a few hundred protesters would not permit ice or other federal agencies to operate\nInside a federal building hours later the remaining ice workers were finally evacuated by a small federal police team the facilities shut down for more than a week they couldn't function complete\nRampant mob violence in Portland, Oregon which is similar to what's happening in San Francisco and other cities\nBut now the protesters in Portland are back on the streets blocking traffic have you seen the video several dozen\nOr in a particularly disturbing video protesters takeover intersections stopped traffic breathing harass older white man in cars refused to obey their traffic directions\nPortland police under the idiotic leadership of mayor Ted Wheeler do nothing they yell at these older white men you're a little white supremacist go back to the south know KKK here et cetera\nIn one video protesters smashed an older white man sedan with baseball bats after he makes it a turn against their wishes they've taken over the streets shouting who streets our streets\nAfter the drivers zipped down the street to get away from them they chased after him for some reason he stopped going out of his car to inspect the damage\nIn his car with ... minister more damage he got back in his car quickly ahead of the mob and left\nThis emerging brand and called St anarchy has lost money asking Portland married Ted Wheeler to regain control\nOf the city which he refuses to do was flipped to scrimp what if some city maybe in the south a whole bunch of white

Louisiana was shot and almost killed by a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter who wanted to kill Republican congressman chased out of restaurants in the elevators on streets in airports the left as

her in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... you know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nTore apart the story or seen afford improve that she was either upper very cater or a lawyer or both\nAnd they can prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even present\nAnd so when this has happened is that going to stop the radical left now from perpetrating lies again spread cabinet and the answer is not just know\nThe answers hell no they're going to continue\nOn a tactical long ago this this is what they do and that's the part that just absolutely mindboggling to me you know it's like [noise]\nIt just it just it just doesn't seem like there's any ethics life to the non where whereas the moral gauge what point do stand up with some kind of ethical value and go this is wrong regardless by a political opposition\nWarehouse why are you know what's going on here is that it's a constant fight it kind of began with pork\nAnd then continue to Clarence Thomas a little bit of Alito his wife cried had to leave the room with Alito Democrats through this they're Republicans but even though a lane and Kagan made several misstatements nobody talked about perjury nobody talking about impeachment\nLindsey Graham voted for Sotomayor he voted for Kagan Democrats due to the Republicans but Republicans have too much character to do it to to Democrats when there was an odd to writers of Charlottesville that does something wrong\nAnd those clowns those fools if you're a white guy marching around a southern city with tiki torches yelling about Jews then you're a clown in Europe fool we can have that in this country and it happens on occasion\nBut the constant drumbeat from the left whether it's Portland or San Francisco or antifa or whether it's the Democrats in Congress or whether it's those in restaurants in elevators that chase down\nThe Republicans it's happening ten times more often with Democrats and Republicans but I guarantee a John the media will not cover it that way the media coverage Charlottesville and they should have covered Charlottesville why take covering when ... was doing in Portland, Oregon that's what I Want one of the cover that\nOh because it doesn't\nEven Phillies gunned down how about a democratic hunting and gunning down a Republican warning that killed dozens and it was one day story and they stopped the Stevens ... story after one day if a a someone wearing a mega had\nDone that to a Democrat they would have followed that Democrats for months to talking about the daily struggles that Democrats had the violence committed by Republican but when Stephen ... shot down like a dog at a baseball practice was one or two day story because it didn't fit the narrative the media dropped in like a hot potato\nI held member my by high school journalism or God rest his soul you know the biggest thing ... pushed out everybody had a war or the
