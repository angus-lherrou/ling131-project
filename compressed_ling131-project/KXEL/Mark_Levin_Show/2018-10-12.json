think you're over generalizing about a mob mentality of the left\nTrying to destroy people's lives okay let me give you another example Matthew Collins a student from her net Central High school in North Carolina was actually kicked out of high school football game\nFor wearing a usa\nTorch holding shirts now the torch was the the the statue of liberty George on the front with the words usa on the front in red white and blue and one sleeve was red and white stripes and flag the other slaves was the blue and the stars of the flag\nOn the back and had his name like a Jersey what habit says Trump forty five was the number for him being the forty fifth president now the reason\nWhy he was wearing the shirt to the football game ... high school football game is because he was participating in the usa America night\nWell the principal saw the back of his shirt and kicked him out because the shirt quote offended someone [noise]\nYeah but definitely not a mob mentality you got to high school kid wears a shirt that says Trump forty five on the back\nLooks like a Jersey with the u._s._a. on the front and the and the torch being held of the statue of liberty and the principal kick them out of the game he understands comes and find them in the stands\nThen the torch being held of the statue of liberty and the principal kick them out of the game the in the sand comes and finds him in the stands because someone who was offended and you don't want me to believe that there is a mob mentality against conservatives by the left in this country calm on\n\nThis is what they do to silence high school kids\n\nYou know kind of a west today said in the oval office illegal guns are not are the problem\nSays ... ... the illegal guns are the problem not illegal guns we have the right to bear arms and was allowed to say they say the president is taking advantage of a black man a token black man\n\nWho clearly has mental health issues shaming Kanye West because he doesn't say what they believe he should be saying as a black man\n\nThey call them a token negro they say is an intention or they say should be in a mental hospital and they say about ... that this is what happens when a black man well not a black man this is how they put it\nWas what happens when they grow they don't read\nThe car sellers about debate all the time on TV I consider my friend I disagree with him on this one\n\nThis is what happens\n\nI mean saying the guys now an educated [noise] it was as what happened when they grow they'll read [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah it's it's definitely not a mob mentality is definitely not a find somebody destroy somebody character assassinate them I mean it was world meant I mean I say this early I'll say it again yesterday October tenth as world mental health day\n\nSo your shame a guy that you claim has mental health issues how's that work out then ...\nFor him [noise] you don't care about his mental health you just want to act like he's crazy so you can attack him and say it's crazy because he got off the Democratic plantation and started saying things that you don't like\nThe one he said and George Bush said why fee for all he was a brilliant artist then yeah buddy Roy ... heart is\nIn Ferguson filling in for Marshall then we'll be right\nBack\nFor years I've been sleeping on my Casper mattress\nCuriosity I saw the play by play and political analysis here not as adults will fall on our White House it was\nAn assault on our White House definitely not a mob mentality that by the left no that was you're not going to get thoughtful analysis\nFrom uh I saw the play by play and political and I'll sit here and not as adults in his office on our lifetime when\nI was an assault on our White House I'd tell you how it gets better listen more MSNBC not just telling us not just an assault on our White House now and go and do Clinton was getting or sex from an intern in the oval office ... that was not an assault on our White House oh\nFive and we're not a ... where he began to analyze some of the stuff that was said I'm as we warned you saw a little bit of profanity we there was actually more than you heard we we were able to bleach some of it out [noise] um but there was a ... to make it in there\nI'm afraid that others I mean the things that are tiny I said well it's my favorite yeah\nAnd he talked about the lack of male role model in his life growing up a lot of mail energy and he was wrong that was because of the male with our\nWith that cap on how you felt like a guy who could play catch with his his and\nI still have that opportunity when ... when he also said you know a lot of African Americans out there and I'm like you can still make America great again and then ... will are anything by a white now\nFor ... for life a life of that are for you than it is and the current lawmakers funny alley with access they complain that the president was I was just as I say in line that's an outright lie I Hope for the White House myself several days ago and I said I'd like to know unpredictable finance and they think that's what several weeks without a rule oppressed\nThose are the White House myself several days ago and I like that you know unpredictable as anything just was so are we as was absolutely a press that went\nDown the way you would think actually a meeting between the president on your was your browser by the way it was said a black to really like you get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry is comment to appoint police brutality is to release the love\nAnd he said that there should be in Chicago easy id Asian centers that's when\nThe power which is a man named think of his uh uh need a savior he said that the law that sentiment against him the ball and go for it and make so much money when the genus I'm just telling the costs of war and you\nKnow we're going to have a good thought they were to have a conversation which we would follow up on 'em in bars on criminal justice reform sentencing and prisons which is why the way a bipartisan really important idea there was that was mostly nonsense\nAnd that was mostly nonsense 'cause\nThat man and white man was conservative\nThat was an assault on our White House\nImmediately after county where us and the oval office wow that was bonkers if you thought you were going to get a thoughtful way by playing political announces you're not when we knew that that you guys MSNBC grow because that was an assault on our White House\nYou can't analyze some of that stuff that was crazy thank you for that thoughtful announces which he promises you are not going to give us Shona you are on the market then show Ben ... filming in hello\nHey Ben how's it going doing well how are you doing\nGood [laughter] I just wanted to say that I'm as a as a black woman a young black woman I Am so incredibly proud of Kanye West\nHe's speaking for the people like myself who are the the super silent majority right I mean there is like\nThe eight percent of us or something crazy and and I think that there's more out there and I think that we're winning we're actually winning that's why the left as going because there that's why the\nThe mainstream media is going bunkers as they called him because they know that if we get just a few percentage points more\nOf the black vote it's over for him it doesn't matter where they can say whatever they want to say they can keep pushing that that racist talking point that the Republicans are racist people like myself are waking up and I'll tell you something bad I'm thirty three years old I was born and raised a lifelong Democrat\nI was a liberal I was an idiot okay I ate up all of that crap\nThat they fed me my whole life which was that you know I couldn't get a head that I Would never be treated equally I never felt more ... than when I went to south haven Mississippi and I went to a Trump rally and I wore that make America great again hat and I totally\nYour own home now you need to go to a mental hospital you need to go to a mental hospital run away\nRight well I'll tell you what you know what a mental hospital is better than the Democrats plantation and you know what they look how quickly they turn on you when you don't agree with what they say and the sad thing about it is is that the cardio sellers what's really sad is he's ...\nHe's the person that they put up there to lie to all of us for their vote\nPro I Know who to think I think he's a leader in the Democratic party because he's able to marginalize into black people that they can't you can't disagree with the Democratic party or you are going to be an Uncle Tom and if you're not going to be accepted in your communities you're not going to be accepted in your church and give me something you're neighborhoods\nBut then on top and the more and more black people and getting out there and I'm saying things that I'm Talking to people and people are starting to wake up it little by little and you kinda have to\nProduce them and ask them questions and things like that but people are starting to say Trump not that bad he's not the racist that people keep lying and saying that he is\nDo you want to you want to look at the you ought to look at it that this is my I was growing down my Twitter feed right now are people that are listening to the show tonight who were telling me that they actually believe that Kanye West should be the mental hospital\n... mental health shaming someone the day I and world mental health day when Democrats telling me they care about mental health needs should never shame any by just shame someone and use mental health to shame a person\nMay have noticed shows I they have ...\nYou know and and it's okay if they do it it's okay if they do it but if we split up and we say one thing and they're going to crucify of twenty four seven and it's sad\nIt's sad because uh you know they run the media they really do we have a few people like yourself in the end marvel at it in that you know are are telling the truth but for the most part\nYou know they're they're bought and paid and they're on their and their brainwashing people twenty four hours a day and in fact the matter is if you look at the black community oh you have to do is open your eyes see I live in Memphis, Tennessee run by a Democrat and it's from that\nAnd you can do to every single Democrat city black people have got to wake up\nThey've got a wake up and said well if you reason for us to continue\nTo vote for one party and makes no sense on planet earth when that party has done nothing for your school system it's done nothing for the prison system it's done nothing for bothers the lack of fathers and the homeless welfare state and\nAnd people are ... wake up and they'll look around and say that the party has never done anything for me and\nWhen I did that I'll tell you something then it changed my entire life at the moment I was a red pills\nAnd Russia China I think you great to talk to you you know you're talking about unhinged um [laughter] I got an article loosened to me earlier says you and your dog can now pee all over Donald Trump thinks two statues\nThey're set up in Brooklyn a it's a the boss of Donald Trump with fake grass and says beyond me\n\nIf that's not on the hinge if that's not a mob mentality when you
