people whose views are and that's not the ash\nThere for the last in response to your question has nothing to fear for it for much atheist I have nothing to fear from as Islam as long as it doesn't attack us has nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet they the the ... the the totalitarian the authoritarian the suppressor of free speech and liberty come from the left\nAnd we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by while the secular laugh destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroy sacred values that that underlying honor guard all of our freedoms\nAre and we can't just some Christian some past a Christian suggest we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth but he passed it by standard we need to be active and there's nothing\nIncompatible with Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance with our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the left as hard as they buy that we don't have to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and his chance\nAnd that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear from match we had a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if they had the power\nTo book is Jesus is risen it's by David Limbaugh or you can get at an Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already ... show Facebook ... we have a

David is so respectful of other face and other beliefs and other people he said well\nAre you really short because you know I'm I'm Talking about Jesus and you know and you're Jewish and so forth [noise] and I said I get it it's okay I Want you to come on my show I Want you to talk about\nThis I'll tell you why Davidson we're gonna come back in thirty seconds\nI say more vibrant some more

well better sometimes they're manufactured right here in America\nYes and and that's been documented and and\nA lot of people want to do that because it again the answer is of the secularists to say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious man that they were secularists in\nA day they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation or back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was\nBut we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to is something that's on now to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian cannot see the last\nFive as Obama tried to bring on\nAnd he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation but nothing like it appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his son a mental transformation was not a restoration of where we started about a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction\nOf our founding principles in my view\nNow again not [laughter] I Want to say I'm an expert on this subject I won't even say I'm close to that [noise] but the way you're dividing your writings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning is how is how and where do you go from here\n[noise] okay I Am\nBeginning is how is out and then where do you go from here\n[noise] okay I Am\nA again wanting to complete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written some of the Old Testament and I want to help readers really understand the Bible so these\nThis and I want to give them a historical perspective and so the book of acts in the early church the history of the early church really happened in history these are real people\nAnd and I wrote and I and I included the book of acts as I say what did the history of the early church and then sexually apostle Paul Thirteen of pills he\nWrites these forms the Iraqis letters to the churches after he had planted these churches throughout the Roman empire and they're falling away from the religion they're falling prey to the secular influence is just like we see today the secular influences a pagan shitty of corn which was\nDominated by a sexual immorality and I'd our trade from me\nMainly feature of the the love God it's after ... and Paul would write to these churches in such a personal and intimate way saying look I formed us up I Would birth a baby and I told you the truth gospel and here you are deviating listen to the listening to these\nPagan influences and following your laughable desires and he told them what they needed to do to get back on course up all the false teachers but remember what he told them when he was there and then he gives them instruction on practice a Christian living at a live right\nBack out to be good moral people listen to the Holy Spirit of a bay the Holy Spirit\nAnd then and then continue to do what is right and he also expanded on the doctor and the Christian doctor\nAnd what's interesting mark is this really happened in history and I want to give readers a sensor that history because when when they when they read it they will understand really at an all though Paul wrote these letters to particular church it\nHe didn't know that though they were inspired by God they would be a click of all to all of us\nFor the next two thousand or however many years the world exist\nSo there have universal application to all churches in all the people who read these letters even though they were written to individual people at a specific point in time in history we still profit from them today as Christians blamed their holy scripture the New Testament they become part of the New Testament and God's word in our view\nSo it's just wrong miraculous how this has occurred and people can really profit from these from these words which we believe are God's work so I Want to help all my book is not\nA God's word it's a book about God's work trying to sell a tape people's understanding of dance they're learning curve reduced or intimidation about the Bible and most of all as I said again inspire them to read it and gobble it up like I've tried to do the last Twenty years\n[noise] well you're very much the renaissance man the
