also send us an email news of gigs wheels\nOn [noise] you know\nLadies and gentlemen is he really is a ... and I say that and I truly mean to have run just scientists\nThe Republican running for governor of Florida on this program I have been a fan of his since the day was elected I watched him work in the house of representatives he saw that he has enormous integrity he's a he's in Iraq that\nWas a very smart guy graduated from Harvard and he's so smart and um and he's taken the lead on so many issues that are important to this country Rhonda scientists how are you my friend\nI'm doing great mark how're you doing\nI'm doing fine you know I watch this debate last night with your opponent Gillum and I got to say this\nBefore we get into substance he's a very nasty guy I mean the ... he turns to you I he must have called you a liar twenty times uh he uh he just said some incredibly snarky things and I thought to myself\nThis guy's cocky he thinks that he has it in the bag and I suspect he does not mean what did you make of the debate\n... book I think I think that whole performance was really beneficial for me I mean you know when you're running for governor mark\nObviously you know voters are going to look to see you know do they agree to it or not and so I'm somebody who is running on keeping Florida low tax eight he wants to massive tax\nLaw enforcement he's running saying we shouldn't abolish ice since are there different obviously it's huge policy differences but and the governor's race um ... it's sort of like a senator a house race\nIt's more than just about your position because about leadership and who could actually do the job and I think his antics\nJust showed that he's not somebody that would be a good governor even apart from his radical left wing ideology so I think his whole performance backfired\nI mean a lot of people that and then looked at me and they obviously now get a phone with my biography my service of the country I'm not going to pay the easy decisions that I'm just a better leader then go on\nOne of the things that's very very troubling to me knowing you now for several years\nYou lead the fight in the house of representatives to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nWhen nobody thought it would go anywhere you lead the fight in the house of representatives pressing for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem you succeeded along with the president along with are are wonderful bashing her Freeman and so forth\nAnd then for him and his party to suggest that you supported by neo Nazis when in fact are the biggest voice for the state of Israel and the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nAnd I think it was so ridiculous that I think voters just just about all I mean\nGive me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he's been endorsed by this radical left wing group dream district ... but he actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical Minnesota okay I'm In this group dream defenders one of their main ah things is boycotting Israel bbs\nThey say Israel the genocidal apartheid state so that the group he stands where he will not disavow Amish groups dot as soon as he is and I'm actually just today there was a group of we're thirty eight sheriff's in\nFlorida right give them a letter asking him to get the ... dream defenders because uh the pledge that Gillum signed a said that police in prison camp no place injustice they want to abolish\nBasically traditional law enforcement gift one day and then spend the money on welfare programs that can be very radical stuff it's dripping with hatred for men and women are in law enforcement and it's just totally unacceptable and go on and he will not budge scraping by that and and that's just unacceptable cross or yeah for\nHim to say that I think there was um there are they going to ... and ... voters are sicker people on the ... are just lashing out why grad folks and I think it really backfired big car [noise]\nYou know ... when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to it so there's no confusion any signs of petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signed a petition in favor of moving police office\nSenator to it so there's no confusion [noise] any signs of petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signs of petition in favor of moving police officers out of prison and more than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and move it under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his\nProblem is he rejects law enforcement and your point was this one is a criminal alien serves time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they're either turned over to the feds who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being deported isn't that basically has position\nYeah I asked them on Sunday nights they can and will you honor\nA painter requests they're called painters ... federal government wants to take a criminal illegals coming out of them will you honor became a request from Donald Trump's agency he would not say he wouldn't do that and so he said oh I don't want criminals on the shape of the fact the matter is he pledged not to cooperate with I\nMean this idea that all he wants to do is move and under the Justice Department marking him trying to backtrack off his position you know when he was running ads in the primary thing abolish ice because they want to open borders got caught a far left one\nAnd he was playing to the bay so the idea that all he wants to do with like a ministry his tweak or he's lying when he says that he wants to abolish the agent a doesn't want immigration enforcement\n[noise] now when we come back after the bottom of the hour run to scientists by the way what is your website Ron\nRon ... dot com\nI we're going to put it up on my social sites ladies and gentlemen Ron's being big time outspent\nDisguise Soros behind them is that Styron behind them all the left wing billionaires and left wing groups they're targeting Florida they know if they take Florida it's going to be very difficult to win the presidency in the future and again behind a true Bernie Sanders George Soros people for the American way which is so he works\nFor radical\nWhen we come back I Want to ask the census there's an FBI investigation\nThat's been taking place in Tallahassee where this guy was mayor and Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it while there I ...\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel whoever the IRS tens of thousands of backpacks and he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway now than you know heard how much I respect optimal\nPublic reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said Andrew is not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting omission because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized censorship that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOr her name is Jeanette New Years she's a state representative from Miami she's a Cuban American\nCuban American and then when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking female Hispanic history of Florida government\nMm I noticed the media doesn't talk much about that\nNow of course not but I'll tell you with Andrew lashing out like this I mean when you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this also stuff's feather mess like answered\nTalking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this office to feather your own mess like dams or did\nThey mapped the problem is interesting mark there wasn't just a the illegal stuff that he died when he was on the Tallahassee city commission or he didn't vote to raise property taxes on people but he also voted to increase his own retirement benefits\nBy tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling could pay fine so he wanted the people that were happy to pay more and he wanted somebody to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing politician or whether ... whether it's illegal votes like that which are corrupt anyway\nOr illegal activity like accepting the Hamilton ticket and turning around and given these guys the deal they wanted\nAny work for this group people for American way is that correct\nYeah and here's the thing about that that's a very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing may say they pay Andrew Gillum Mrs while he's the mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year\nTo work forty hours a week\nWell the mayor Tallahassee is a fulltime job so how how was he working forty hours a week\nFor people for the American way so one of two things are true either he is actually doing that in which case he neglected to people Tallahassee which may explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and one of the most that they have the highest crime rate in Canada or\nHe ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he's basically accepting money without performing services so what are the other is problematic no matter which way you\nWhile you know I'm a little confusing but the nation is in the Floridians are too you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entered a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah and I think would be my question is their\nPeople for the American way said that was in exchange for him working forty hours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to him but if he was working forty hours a week to them\nHow does that make the people tell me feel you know they have the guts out of control crime problem he's raising the taxes he's doing all these gang\nAnd yet he's working on the left wing group so it's a problem either way but it's interesting even though these documents are out there\nUm journalists do not pursue that at all I mean if I if I Walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk you know they try to do do different stories on me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really that should be investigated by the crash\nI Want to hear to other things before you go and that is health care and taxes [noise]\nHe ah has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare everyone on they don't employ your\nPrivate employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union is negotiated a health care plan they will lose their health care plan\nEverybody will lose the health care that they have now with some theory some ... some concoction they'll create or Washington DC will have the science is a system where the like it or not whenever you have today disappears\nAnd what does this response to this and he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nOne little correction market it eliminates I think that for about three hundred million people the two things and Bernie's bill keeps\nOr the VA in the Indian Health service so now I guess that means that all that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent checking on her health care if they do this but bottom line is right so here's responses when I called them out on that was basically to act\nLike he didn't know what I was talking about he was running commercials saying single payer Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that that is toxic and Florida because we have senior citizens who have their arrangement they've been paying into Medicare Medicare Advantage program\nWe have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer um through their employment\nAnd he wouldn't take all of that a way you have no choice you get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know will cause tax increases it will bankrupt us\nIt'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration and so yeah you may have the right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor is going to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we know the drill and all that so that is not popular once people know\nWhat it is and so basically he just tried to run away from it as much as he can um even though in the primary he came back the way that you win win in Florida so we're going to keep reminding voters\nAbout let me look about taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states as you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reason you have such a dynamic economy and such a diverse economy in Florida and I'm a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between a no tax income tax they and I have a home and I my primary residence in Virginia and an income tax state\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making his his I'd never supported a state income tax\nThat's what these guys do I saw in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not ... and then they push and push the spending and the debt and then either they push for an income tax or some court orders an income tax he supports an income tax and intrusive Disney\nSo there was a study done a nonpartisan study that analyzes all his spending proposals and the conclusion of the study was here in order to make it work he would either need a new one or two things have a statewide sales tax\nOf thirty eight percent or impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes where he would be able to pay for because you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff\nAnd that's what it would cause so you go down that road a Florida is done economically I mean they were totally cripple our economy and critical our state and we obviously can't let that happen all that all\nFifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure\nAll these cities are trying what they wind up doing is that the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who were punished\nBecause what happens is people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even chains can't afford it and so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places and people lose jobs they lose camps\nI mean this doesn't help people actually mandating a Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequences\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got to college I worked all these jobs for six bucks an hour through college I wouldn't have been able to get through without that and it on his policies were in place\nI Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made Niro I Would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people\nThe euro would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people out of work he will cause businesses to shut down the stairs to leave the state um but here's the thing markets Seattle and you mentioned\nA lot of the people who who kept their jobs and they'd get a pay increase to five Fifteen they still ended up with less take home pay because their hours cut reduce by the ... so\nIt's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he ... he doesn't care and this is what he's running\nIt's particularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job\nSame with his open borders policies that particularly harms or know skilled or low skilled the unskilled or low skilled individuals [noise] but uh he claims to represent these people but his policies crush these people\nRun dissent us once again what is your site America we have all of in search let's give all the support we can to Rhonda sent us in Florida let's increases
