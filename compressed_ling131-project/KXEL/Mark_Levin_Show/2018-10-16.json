candidates for U.S House district one congressman rock one state representative I think an hour in a moment I won't explain the rules of tonight's debate\nBut first let's meet the candidate by the flip a coin represented Finkenauer you will go first you have one minute for opening statements well\nThank you so much and they said to be here and I have a Congress and blind and the moderator here thank you for putting this on again I'm the representative Abby Finkenauer and I'm running for Congress here in this district because it's a personal\nI grew up a daughter of a union pipe fitter while they're my mom actually just retired from the W. community school district as a secretary back in February you know there were four kids in my family are all first generation college graduates are still paying off the loans though not always easy but at the end of the day\nI grew up in a state and in a country where if you worked hard you couldn't make it again that is what we were told and that is what we were prominent and unfortunately right now that crime is his name broken in Washington DC\nIt's about time we send someone Iowa values to D.C to stand up for working families like I did in that state house for the last four years to bring some comments that invest in infrastructure trade programs apprenticeship\nAnd actually make sure that we take on health care and fix it in this country because at the end of the day I with my home and this is our country I mean I Do whatever I can to fight Brett\nThanks very much Congress we woke up one\nFirst of all it's a thing KGAN for hosting this debate I think the debates are important I think it's important that Iowans 'cause we're we're each of us did on actual policy versus soundbites from attack yet\nI'm a father a grandfather\nOn my husband uh also been a high school basketball coach than a a columnist for the telegraph hero for Thirteen Years and I've been a job creator\nI Know what it's like to me to payroll\nI Know what it's like the up at night wondering if you can meet that payroll and I know what it's like to grow company is one reason Iran does not for the pay is out to be on Fox News\nAnd it certainly is not to be a career politician the reason I ran as I felt the American dream which I Lived my parents had just great educations I felt the American dream was slipping away\nFrom this country that's wonderful citizens that I wanted to go to Washington DC to make sure that we restore the American dream that's available\nFor all the citizens in this great country for their children or grandchildren\nBut very much now we want to quickly take a look at the rules with boat which both candidates have agreed to after a question is asked\nBy myself for Mr sun the candidate has Ninety seconds to answer\nTheir opponent will then have sixty seconds to respond the moderator cut out the follow up to each candidate if they choose to that candidate has thirty seconds additional the response no candidate may I ask for a brief response to respond to their called out by their opponent but were urging them to keep their bottles brief as it will cut into their total time\nLimit the ability to respond later in this debate so with all of that in in shape\nNow turn it over to just sign of am Fifteen for ... for the first question of\nNick thank you very much good evening congressmen and giving representative because of the coin toss the first question is yours representative think an hour and it has to do with the economy\nAs a member of Congress in a capitalistic society there are things you can and cannot do to help the overall economic climate of the country and all of American so as a member of Congress what steps would you advocate that Congress could take\nThat would ease the situation for people in this country\nWell first of all when we're talking about especially when it when it comes to taxes that tax reform package that cars and bomb you voted for that had at one point nine trillion to the doctor said that gave eighty three percent of it to the top one percent or isn't the way you do it and you know the tax cuts for working families\nWeren't permanent the fact is right now any type of tax relief package we need to be looking at\nShouldn't be looking at leveling the playing field here making sure that we're closing those corporate loopholes\nAnd corporations are paying their fair share we also have to raise wages here in this country as well so that every single person no matter where you live if you're working forty hours a week you're able to make not to make a lot ... able to make a life\nIt's incredibly important here and something we just haven't seen we also should be investing and trade schools an apprenticeship program\nAnd that includes looking at expanding even the Perkins act which I was just reauthorized I think it's great it's something that a Waterloo community school districts were able to utilize we should be expanding that where we get more trade or a trade schools and apprenticeship program training in our school district\nCongressman sixty seconds\nSo to a country you been living in every last for three years but our economy is absolutely booming if you haven't noticed and due in large part to those tax cuts they are working\nThe average family of four in my district is going to say two thousand four hundred and sixty four dollars a year over the next ten years the twenty five thousand dollars we have for the first time or history more job openings than we have people looking for jobs\nWe have seven point one million job openings it was just announced today\nWe haven't we haven't had that many job openings I don't think in the history of our country optimism is up in the unemployment rates are down and you say we want people to make more money I couldn't agree more it's one of the reasons I ran in the middle class we can increase their wages now\nYou're probably want to do that through government dependency I Want to do it through the miracle of the free market and just what\nThe pay raises in late last quarter April May June we're the largest in ten years and in fact the it'll pay raises an Iowa or five point one percent so you're entitled to your own opinion but you're not into your own facts and the fact you not support your attack ad\n... thought well let me ask the rebuttal question and I think you can probably complicit in thirty seconds you've used the phrase working families a couple of times tonight to find what that is you also mentioned corporations paying their fair share to find that so we have some parameters please\nYes so first of all let me be very clear here I when he's talking about folks getting ... there was just pull out the other day which supports what I'm hearing out there in the district where folks are working their tails off right now and they're not seeing an increase in their take home pay\nFolks making Ninety thousand dollars a year or less are not seeing an increasing their take home pay and that happening all across our country right now and you've got folks who are you know working forty hours a week I work in their tails off sometimes multifamily homes and not able to make it\nAnd let me ask you congressman representative think an hour in her remarks talked about the tax bill is talked about percentages address that or is that the way things first of all do you agree with the numbers and second is that the way things should be a Porsche\nGreatest percentage of tax relief did go to the middle class if you look at first\nThings first of all do you agree with the numbers and second is that the way things should be a Porsche\nGreatest percentage of tax relief did go to the middle class if you look at percentages here's another fact that's not a here's another fat fat didn't interrupt interrupt you not let me finish please\nBottom fifty percent in this country play pay three percent of the federal income tax the bottom fifty percent of wage earners so it's hard and it was going to take people off of the income tax rolls completely to give tax relief or to the bottom fifty percent when they're only paying three percent of the total federal income taxes\nWhen we talk about workers in increase wages their wages are going up the largest increases in ten years that's a fact from the nonpartisan congressional budget office in from the department of labor that's a fact in fact they are going up faster in Iowa than the rest of the country that go on a five point one percent\nRight Nick thanks very much a congressman belong\nEconomic growth has accelerated during the Trump Administration but the fed is now raising rates in order to try and stave off inflation what steps does Congress need to take in the coming year to prevent an economic slowdown\nWhile I Am concerned as a president is about the Federal Reserve\nOr increasing the interest rates to quickly or ... one of their jobs is to make sure that the value of our currency is not devalued which means we need to try to keep inflation under control I've seen very few reports of inflationary pressure\nYes and well first of all I mean this is another reason why this raises personal I mean my sister and brother in law or corn and soybean farmers are like ... all over the Midwest right now who are worried every single day about their livelihood because of a trade war this administration decided to start on Twitter\nLook there is no doubt right now is that right that ... or is that this administration took working families took folks are farmers here and use them as poker chips that they were willing to fat and lose on a trade war there's no question that China's a bad actor\nBut there has been no strategy and I do think it's something that we have to get together\nTalk to our corn growers talk to our soybean farmers and make sure that they know that we have their backs here\nUh you know right now you got Brazil and China making new contract with those soybeans and are these are contracts that us farmers had made for a decade and I've worked for for decades and they're seen going to go away I mean this is again not how this is supposed to work and we deserve better\nIt's very much for this round we are going to be speaking about health care and related issues which include Medicare and Social Security so the question to represent into thinking our in Ninety seconds if you were to address and I'm going to focus on the Affordable CARE Act\nOr if that was a member of Congress what would you take to modify amend change what is currently on the books\nYeah thank you what it is something we've got effects I I was out there within the first couple of months of my campaign and I met a woman who had oxygen and they came up to me and she said that ah if that bill that Congress and blowing voted for eight CIA wouldn't think become law passed the Senate the somebody signed by the president\nSaid her doctor told her that she wasn't going to be able to afford her oxygen all twenty four hours and she was going to have to pick whether she read that night or during the day and she looked at me and said you don't pick when you breathe why should I have to I went well we've got to do something here we've got to stop playing politics with health care and get serious about fixing that's in our country\nAnd so what we've got to do is add a public option to the AC a or something that quite frankly should've been done to begin with cracking the CIA so that is allowing self up to the age of sixty five to buy into Medicare essentially lowering those premiums adding competition into the marketplace you can keep your own insurance\nAnd drive down those premiums and you know we've got folks Democrats or Republicans no party doesn't matter where you live in this country right now\nYou're struggling with your healthcare coverage and we've got to get serious stop playing politics and what we don't do his vote for a bill that's going through a player repeal Sunday not replace it with anything and at the same time allow insurance companies they charge more ah for folks improve the conditions and older Americans that's not how this again is supposed to work\nAnd uh we we we've got to fix it and get serious here\nCongressman sixty seconds with regard to the current law and what if you were returned to Washington you would advocate doing with regard to Affordable Care act or replacement\nThat'd be attacking me with more more more Kim lines from euro ads on TV attacking me is not policy\nThat'd be attacking me with more more more can lines from euro ads on TV attacking me is not policy I haven't heard policy yet saying there shouldn't be political bulletin just as political Washington DC is very political\nVery political so I haven't heard policy from you I'll I'll gladly you'll my time to listen to the actual policy now but what we need to do to keep it simple at the sixty thousand foot level Jeff we need to help people who need help financially government is good at taxing and sending out checks and let's do that\nPeople on Social Security Medicare are veterans particularly our special needs folks out there and our veterans\nWe made promises to these people and we need to keep him and we need to help them on the other end of the equation when it comes to health care less unleash the miracle of the private sector of the free market\nThis is an over regulated market place and the key here isn't cost shifting the kids to bring down the cost of health care and you don't do that by having your neighbor pay your health insurance we\nNeed to actually decrease the cost of healthcare through the private market\nIn thirty seconds representative Finkenauer let's talk specifically about how we keep Medicare Social security solvent going forward\nYet how well what we don't do it again and say we're we care about Medicare and Social Security and at one point nine traveling to the deficit that in fact that you just heard Mitch McConnell said that he's worried about that that that that they're gonna have to look at entitlements and like they let the very clear that by entitlement he needs Social Security and Medicare\nWhich are a prominent we made to each other and at the problem is that we better be able to keep and so we've got to get serious here as well but we shouldn't do\nIts taxes and Social Security income over a million dollars and at the same time when we are when we're talking about Medicare we shouldn't be allowing drug companies to go directly with Medicare lower the price that\nCongressman thirty seconds specifically on Medicare and Social Security\nThere you go again this is not going to cost the federal government that sense I guess if you repeat a lie often enough some people will believe that we need to have a bipartisan solution when it comes to Medicare and Social Security Medicare is going to go broke and eight years\nSocial Security is going to go broke and sixteen years so it needs to be a bipartisan solution I've always had Republicans don't have a corner on great ideas and neither do Democrats a couple of the Democrat ideas\nThat to help protect these two programs that I like is lifting the cap on the income that you pay into Social Security and also perhaps a means test Social Security we should look at those ideas as well as some of\nOur ideas that were in a kind of delve into the health care a little bit more here and then we're going to take a quick break I'm On the issue of opiates congressman\nThere's been some legislative efforts on this growing problem but the epidemic has taken more live every day here in Iowa and across the country how can Congress not only to tackle\nThis issue from a legislative standpoint\nBut hold those responsible for this accountable\nYes we have a when you say some legislative action has been taken we passed over sixty six old bills in the house of this year on this session or to do with opioids are everyone I think now in the medical community recognizes how powerful the drugs are and they also recognize that people can be addicted to them in as little\nAs five days I've even heard sometimes three days so we need to look at I I spent six hours you know with emergency room physicians that Alan hospital in Waterloo windy and is is very evident when I was in there with them we need to look at\nMaking sure we don't over prescribe opioids to people who have pain\nBecause a lot of some folks came in that six hours as an emergency room and wanted because they want and pain pills\nAnd they weren't in pain so they were shopping or emergency rooms for opioids secondly or we need to do a good job of a better job of prescribing things that are not addictive to control pain nobody wants their patients in pain but we all understand that we'd all agree with that so there are alternative methods\nTo deal with pain that are that are not so addicting as an opioid does so we need to look at that but we passed over sixty a bills in the house this year to help fund decimation of dissemination of information you know amongst the healthcare community and also to research and help you have access to those types of things that are not as addicting as nobody leaders\nAnd represent affected our same question what what does Congress need to do moving forward to address the issue\nWell I think that there is one of these issues where I really believe that Democrats and Republicans can get together on and get something done and we saw that on the house level or there's always more to do I know Congress\nHas attempted to do something here and I know ... you know the president through that I think a million dollars toward that it needs more funding we need to actually make sure that we're supporting our local agencies as well that are fighting that fight on ... on the frontlines here on at the same time\nWhat we have to do as well and make sure that we released the grid that big pharma had\nOver Washington DC right now\nI'll tell ya I've never taken a dying from big pharma I never well Carson's on I don't think you can say the same and in fact Congress is on actually has a investment\nAnd pharmaceutical companies you know if you're looking at getting serious about that we've got to take those influences out of that care about the people here in the district and ah find something that's going to work and I really believe that listening to our local folks that I can have been on the frontline give them what they need\nCongressmen would you care to respond to that they do take money from those girls that are you in this this is one of the things the swamp doesn't politics when selection near a they look at a person that has a stock portfolio and start picking on the stock that you own so beyond Exxon Mobil\nWell then you're against renewable fuels if you own a pharmaceutical company which might be a good investment well then you're in the hip pocket\nOf pharmaceutical Abby I don't vote a certain direction no matter how much money or a company gives me never have and never will at sixty three years old I didn't go to Washington to be for sale\nAnd and I and I do agree with you though that big pharma we need to look at big pharma I'm One that supports a Democrat idea\nA which is having Medicare and Medicaid go shoot the prices\nFor a pharmaceutical and also the re importation of drugs across country lines\nThank you very much part well with that we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back with more of the final first congressional district debate in just sixty seconds so don't go away [noise]\n\nElection in the race for governor of Iowa the Republican Kim Reynolds is facing democratic businessman Fred Hubble Reynolds is trying for her first full term as governor she took the job after former Governor Terry Branstad was named ambassador to China\nDuring their debate put on by the Des Moines register rental said she's running on her record of job training and low unemployment Ireland\nBlack eye to stand by a rosy weight and make them that we have to make sure that is a health uh when it comes to women health issues the same thing in the state houses were going to the in Congress as well that you better make sure those decisions are between a woman and her doctor\nI'll tell ya I heard some heartbreaking stories from women um who are coming under attack in the state of Iowa who were especially and you know face the some of the hardest decisions of their life\nWhen they found out they are very want that baby wouldn't just survived a station\nAnd they were watching their government put themselves in their doctor's offices making those decisions for them and again that's not how this is supposed to work I trust doctors I trust women and these decisions should be made between the two of them\nI truly believe that that is something that has a respect issue I respect everybody's police on the issue as well it's a touchy subject for a lot of folks that means a lot\nI get it where I met with it and where I stand is that there should be between a woman and her doctor and he should have respect for those decisions and uphold roe v Wade\nCongressman sixty seconds same question on the broad topic of abortion was\nWhen you're saying between a woman and the doctor or there's another person involved in this there was a a beating heart and said that woman the woman and a doctor in yet another human being this'll be real simple I'm pro life and I have a one hundred percent pro life voting record in Congress my wife is pro life\nWhen I look I look even to uh the constitution talks about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and live the life first for reason about life\nYou can have liberty without life and liberty you to pursue happiness um we talk about Planned Parenthood\nA I voted to defund Planned Parenthood they get about five hundred million dollars a year of taxpayer money they don't need that from the taxpayers we have unbelievably awesome community health centers in the first district goodbye when I visited all of them I Believe no at least one\nAnd uh we have twenty to one is twenty times more community health centers across the country than there are Planned Parenthood clinics so I'm all for women's health that they can afford it on on for them getting it for free gloves due to a community health center where the job perform\nAbortions representative in thirty seconds\nYou support roe versus Wade which has the viability boy talk about what has been called late for because statistics show\nThat something like fifty percent of those babies survive that twenty four twenty five weeks so does government have a role in some limitation or do you support any limitations\nPluck when it comes to these decisions it should be between a woman in her doctor and this is something again I had to deal with on the state level\nWhere you know I was receiving all these letters from women um who we're hearing again the most horrible news they've ever could imagine when they're going to their doctor and finding out that their baby would not survive gestation\nAh the the way that the state has taken this guy is extreme on you know it's one of those things where just this last or was it like this last year\nUm you know there was a Republican lawmaker from Dubuque county Shannon longer and who literally said\nThat if you're a baby died in the womb and then and you have to carry it to the station I mean that's not what the bill did but that is what she said it was okay with that and again this is one of those things\nThat you are so out of touch with the district if you don't believe that these that as citizens and walked along between a woman and her doctor\nRepresenting dinner yet but yeah and I wonder is directed and please do but in the in the time that we have the thirty seconds per the rules\nDo you support any exceptions to abortion and if so explain to me what those are and under what circumstances would want\nTo point out that my opponent uh she ... she is or she will vote for abortion in the ninth month\nThen also and in most countries in the world after twenty four twenty six weeks as you mentioned you're not allow abortions and secondly geo voted against the bill in Iowa that would prohibit other selling a fetal body part\nUh so uh we're your question please\nTalk to me about the exceptions\nOh yes yes I'm not a you know if it if it's rape or incest certainly that's a horrible thing to have happened to a person but I don't think two\nWrongs make a right and I've talked also do a lot of women who were the victims of a rape or incest and the greatest thing that came from that as a child that they love and they cannot imagine that child not being part of the life and ah if they don't want the child ah there's lots of adoption agency today that would gladly up put the child the production\nOr thank you both can I respond to that we got hit\nYou I'm like what Congress than blondes just talked about there is already federal law prohibiting sale on this is again just politics being played in Iowa when that bill was drafted in the Iowa house it was one of the most poorly pieces of crafts\nThis is again to politics game played in Iowa when that bill was drafted in the Iowa house it was one of the most poorly pieces of craft that legislation I think they were apparently playing politics in fact I voted for an amendment upholding federal law on the issue\nUm I support federal law on the issue\nAnd that Congress men again it was so poorly crafted that it was putting lifesaving research at the University of Iowa on the line here and that's not again what we should be doing with our politics I again I support the federal on it and it was\nOne of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen\nAll right thank you both but I Want to move on to a topic that doesn't get a lot of play lately with with the economy everything ahead of it and that's the war on terror bomb congressman ward and Seventeen years ago Congress authorized then President Bush on the use of force\nAgainst those who attacked us on nine eleven um every president since then has used that as justification for attacks somewhere\nIs it time for Congress to revisit this authorization and if so\nWhere where would you come down on on authorizing President Trump for every any president after him to use force moving forward\nWhat you're referring to the U. N. F. authorization for use of military force a and it had been abused by most presidents regardless of Democrat or Republican stripes uh with the last I Believe legal worn out I mean constitutionally legal war we as World War two\nAnd I believe if we're going to use military force other than if if the threat is imminent okay that when we we don't need to meet in Congress to vote for them and said we have an imminent danger but that aside yes when we get militarily involved in these foreign countries that needs to come before Congress and we need to have a vote on that and we need to debate that\nUh my daughter is Nineteen years old since Sophie has been born all she has known as war\nWe have been in the middle east and war since she has been since he's been born what are we still doing in Afghanistan and I am one that says you know we need to get out of Afghanistan we need to stop abusing you M. F.\nAnd and we need to take a look you know it's easy to get into wars\nBut I I Would always be asking if we could actually debate and vote on and what is the exit strategy a and B how do you define victory because we never seem to be able to extract ourselves I don't believe in nation building\nWe shouldn't be around the world of sacrificing our young men and women the nation build installed democracy and other countries that don't want democracy so has been abused and uh I think all these words would get into should go to a vote of\nCongress representative thinking or do you agree and do you think it's time for the rest to leave Afghanistan after Seventeen years\nLike when I can send military action anywhere\nWe should make sure that our troops are not in harm's way one minute longer than they have to be on anything that we did decide to do should be thought out there should be strategy\nOn and we should have a plan and and unfortunately you know I think that there's something where again the U.S needs he needs to step up and be better about that and make sure we have plans moving forward as well on you know I I Do I Do think that it's something that Congress and he'd say it's a habit than and make sure that\nYou know we had all the facts that we can't possibly have and make that that's possible decision for our troops and for our country\nAnd a representative or I'm Sorry congressman bomb or you you said it's time for us to leave Afghanistan or is there anywhere in the world right now that you feel represented enough of a threat to the United states that military force should be considered by both Congress and the president\nNo there is not currently anywhere in the world I think we should be using military force of different than military presence of other countries where I think it's okay to maintain a military presence as we have done in other places after World War two but as far as military force no\nI was on the budget committee for two years and we debated\nA for a long time what's called seal over overseas contingency operations the billions and billions of dollars these wars cost us just what they're off budget I said what is off budget when I first went to Washington DC\nAnd sounds like a second set of books [noise] so so these things aren't even in the budget and we end up spending spending trillions of dollars on the other side of the world and sacrifice our young men and women's lives thanks very much\nLet's talk now about politics you said we need to not talk about politics we should be more bipartisan and I'm going to have the audacity to ask you a very political question but it ties to the leadership in the chamber and I'll start with you representative\nFinkenauer\nThe first vote\nThat any member of Congress takes at the beginning of a new session is for the leader of their party\nIf the Democrats take the majority in the house you'll be voting for the speaker will you be voting for Nancy Pelosi and if not who", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "16"}
