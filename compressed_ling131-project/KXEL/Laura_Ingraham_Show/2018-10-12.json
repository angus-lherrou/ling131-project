them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically they didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nMaking you know those guys they can get to see that all\nIt was something about like put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made\nFavorite superhero in your mid ... case for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nAll said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that ah the Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the other productions that Trump would lose and a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think as a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we now he hasn't none of us do but I think that there was something profound and what he's\nA friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we now he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course there's a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow\nIn someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nOf the the do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that Conyers brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West let's listen to\nGive me the other thing to have someone to help them and to guide him and he's a hug more than anything Conyers back away from the cameras do get some help and then come back\nAnd make your case nobody if you want to be a conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so ... and beyond say who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be on and on human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomat and all the people devoted their lives to this oil I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room Katy\nPerry running around college campuses ... trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy if a bit him in the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls

it was nothing like that it is right now nothing it's it's much worse and it's much more hate filled [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean the Democratic party that I used to know has gotten hijacked by people disrupt hearings are normally mild mannered senators Cory Booker probably proclaim I'm breaking the rules by releasing confidential information during the hearing\nAnd then you see a senator's being assaulted in airports run out of restaurants with their spouses and or just people being threatened and you know it wasn't a stage college should Rand Paul can probably\nJustify this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence ... Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[noise] what was you know the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nAnd they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now porn or two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as our confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the president Xi I'm a quarter\nSupreme Court as well as our confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the presidency\nI'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a a ... a unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly\nI mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was a interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we need a Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care and ensures that she can stay fails the bar on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed\nIf he or importantly she can make those qualifications\n\nYour reaction to that\nWeb based do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area mildly suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats in the heart left\nUh who were who were uh we're seeing a Korea the is the sort of mob rule\nAnd Senate or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n[noise] well I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout\nWe know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen and mid term elections we usually see a down there and the turnout but\nUh I think the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said while he would have voted for a cabin all but I'm the truth is\nIf you elect a Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to confirmed more federal judges and a Chuck turn the senator over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not I was speaking at this back on account of an issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pack\nThe incentive to me seems\nTo be still there for that type of circus we saw\nFor cabinet and namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report\nOr or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions elite town there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter and then a leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee so much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or I'm most cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this ah I pick up they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this 'cause this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward\nThat names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there's nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it\nAnd someone's lying someone dying here\n[laughter] well I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal jurisdiction whether a federal crime was committed here a ... I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nA Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator or for the next ah you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much I mean just like this is not a fan of the presidents he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said\nThe president will win re election you have Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty or what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time Laura I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\nA has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh uh to the right\nAnd so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who doesn't support either Gorsuch or a warrant cabinets or some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill McCaskill exactly in Missouri I'm did not\nFor one cabinet or at some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill McCaskill exactly on Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents than the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other\nCelebrities on the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and uh I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was at their reading poetry so and now with everything that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump as a near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty ... pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up I'm married to the Democrats does he not I\nWe level we do we are and will remain farmers of ...

yeah\nAnd I think ... may have tipped off something there again political optics political and cultural sensations drive the end result of politics and this if there is indeed a red wave and these midterms\nIt will be driven in part by moments that we saw yesterday and moments and observations like this it's something instinctive people don't like the way they feel when they listen to some of this stuff and this is why I Believe Hillary Clinton's campaign fell flat it\nFelt like you know men were being forced to drink soy all day and they felt awful about themselves the me too movement has also had many victories it's great that that accusers can come forward and tell their stories and if they're true the\nGuy should be thrown in jail if there's statute of limitations not in place\nBut it is also unleashed a kind of toxicity between the sexes and the feeling that all men are predators and that all men should be somehow beaten into a corner and are asking girls or dance or a offering to take her out for drinks is somehow an act of sexual assault\nMen do feel that that's part of their conversation every day to Tony Texas do you want to say what\n[noise] oh one thing I think that as being overlooked protect or the by the mainstream media is is that Jim Brown or they're supporting Conyers Jim Brown is a highly respected individual in the black community he is opinionated and outspoken\nAnd the fact that he supported a car gay and some very nice things to say about the president after the meeting is something I think that is\nPerhaps as significant or even more significant that cognac because of the impact of Jim Brown throughout not only the black community but the white community as well\nMhm well the you know for ... yeah I agree I think that you know both of these figures represent in the in the arena of sports as well as the music and and pop culture\nThese are two huge influence there's huge or let's go to David Illinois why do you think everybody so up in arms and angry about this but meet and greet and white\nRaymond I\nI think the dams have gotten so filled with hate and anger and that's been embraced by the media they slipped and they've exposed they ... they really believe that you're supposed to be have if you do not preach their point of view\nYour racial turned cool\nYou know it's it's a I have to tell you I was imagining as I was listening to this what if someone were directing this kind of think toward me and using such personal term your house slave you're negro who's not reading they set of him\nI mean this is it's so personal and nasty and beside the point so you can't have a black person sit\nOn an e equals footing after resolute desk and have a conversation with the president of the United states for your derided as a house like\nThat I found that ... and on any other day and the other person sitting there that's what the reaction would have been in the media but the moment someone makes another political decision for themselves and decides to talk to a Republican president in this case someone they deeply\nLoad all the tables get turned all the rules are thrown out and you can hurl invective racism or hatred mental deficiency you're a lunatic you're ugly and your music fan we ate your wife me throw that think that the guy we\nWill get into all of this more of your calls and as I keep promising Connors rebooting without Roseanne will you watch and I'll tell you with ABC executives is saying behind the scenes Raymond ... sitting in front of the great lady Laura Ingraham be right back\n\n\nTo used to be forty ...\n\n\nTonight tonight central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady the\nLet's go to be in Colorado you wanted to say what about Kanye West\nBlaming I was watching the clip of comedy on Laura show and something struck me as a possible truce cheaply reached a point\nOr CNN's ratings are higher on the secondary media market than they are in the primary [laughter] meeting you're\nMaking the anger and point Laura always says why are we playing Don Lemon he's getting more viewers on my show that he's ever had on his [laughter] that's the point you're making right\nOnly take about forty seven seconds Josh and and I see more of your show you know edit it down to the nuggets of hate and bitterness and envy and ... and the things they despise so much on other shows I think they've reached the point where\nSo few people are watching but they're paying attention playing it elsewhere\nOr just show exactly how hateful they are and how out of touch their ratings are lower than for network\nPeople like tiny are reaching an inch and they're bitter and angry about it but it's it's quite amazing\nYeah no that that there there is reality there there is truth there um I thank you for the call but there there's no doubt I mean you look at the ratings CNN it's just\nIt's tragic I mean it's really tragic and on big nights like during the cabin all battle and things that they ... they were really hurting I mean in comparison to Fox Fox was having four six million people watching and CNN had a half a million people\nVery interesting what's happening out there but again if that runs been exactly to what I was saying a moment ago\nThese elites think they will tell the public what they want and if they keep doing it the public will have nowhere to go but to them the public will eventually get the genius and keep watching it doesn't work that way programming\nNo longer works that way and there are no longer three networks that\nHold the monopoly on all levels\nIn the country and whether it's the people programming ABC with this Roseanne rebuild or the folks at CNN shoving Don Lemon down people's throats I just don't think it works\nIt ... it doesn't matter what I think it doesn't work they've demonstrably probably does not work Chris New Jersey wanted to say what\nI call it a a Democrat and who\nDoesn't agree with their train of thought on the phone call on it\nOr not on the on the young or is American or whatever I\nWas like oh my God how did that and get away with a certain way again like well look at how you know oh it's just that it was a ... like a lot\nOf work is that like over ... ... and he\nSaid oh that's all they got a\nGreat point great point Chris and it's great and important that you are thinking for yourself thinking outside of whatever identity a stick you were supposed to be exemplify and because of your race your sexuality or whatever\nWe all should be thinking for ourselves we all should be free to move to the right or left\nBut ... to ... script a whole race of people because of the color of their skin I'm Sorry that wasn't Martin Luther king's dream that shouldn't be the aspiration of people a free people\n... and and frankly listening to the hatred the racist hatred coming from even members of Kanye West west own race it's appalling what Don Lemon said yesterday and I'm In a play it for you um he invoked Conyers mother\nWhich I thought it was particularly egregious listen\nWe need to take the cameras away from ... and from a lot of this craziness that happens in the White House because it is not normal this was an embarrassment Conyers mother is rolling over in her grave and she would be terribly disturbed by this in Congress has not been the same sense as mother dive\nThank you Dr\nNow he's a psychiatrist now you can plumbed the depths of Kanye West's mind and heart and his grief apparently Wendy Georgia you wanted to comment on this your reaction yeah\nEven more so to me than the other thing there is another ... down limits comment and it was take the cameras away from ... and the White House [laughter] because I Believe what happened yesterday was so powerful can build upon what dominates ... and other people\nThey it started to pull back that courting and twenty five minutes yesterday 'cause I watch the whole thing I wanted to\nAnd candidates heroin and other people [noise] they started to pull back the curtain and twenty five minutes yesterday 'cause I watched the whole thing I wanted to know exactly what went down and twenty five minutes and then that cartoon about twenty five more fake\nMhm well that's the danger here and I do think\nHe was he was being very vulnerable in front of all those cameras and ... to ... Don lemons point CNN was running the event live to just like everybody else they were desperate for every moment they were not going to miss Kanye West meeting with Donald Trump\nIt was a big moment it was a big moment\nSo to say take the cameras away spare me okay thank you you go back to talking about you know the trade surplus in Indonesia on CNN International and we'll watch ratings continue to create or lower than they are now but\nI you know I see I Want more cameras I Want to see more I Want to see the other side of crazy I Want to see the cameras on Capitol Hill and the lobbyists shaping our our our every bill and pushing legislation that the American people don't want let's see that you want to public service let's\nShow that crazy see we we hyper wheels hyper focus I think all things like this and this is important to the African American vote as a bloc it's very important because a major influential are agents of influence in the middle of that community\nHas decided to come out and say you know what I think differently from what I'm supposed to think\nI'm going to right outside the lines here and that is dangerous tall dangerous talk but beneath that was something else there was a cultural critique about something happening in the black community about father listening about what it means to be a man and not only in the black community in the wider community as well thank you for that call um\nI Know I wanted to talked kept in Kansas and our cat you're in the mid west\nOr the Roseanne show was originally designed to appeal to people like you and that is where the heart of the the viewership for that show came from and I think returned when it re booted some of the highest ratings of last year without Roseanne will you watch the Connors and why not\nFor now I Will not I I Can't do that daughter ours all I'd like John that one and I don't mind her sister\nBut I Will that rose and she was the whole tour of the whole show with her that shows ... when I felt bad for a job that ... for staying there I feel like he is still of the\nOil lives up there but I I Will watch it basically because of how they they did Roseanne and they I don't I Can't stand ... bought our first\n[laughter] well I think you know John Goodman in in um\nInterviews has said you know I think my character is going to spend most of the season moping around a you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife and I think that's probably right that look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality\nThe only reason it ABC was already out of pocket so they were either going to do some show would these people or they were just going to be right paychecks these folks who go off and have a vacation\nBut they were on the hook so that's why the Conner says going forward but is it going to die you bet I think it'll be canceled after a few shows\nThat's my prediction will see thank your cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what then we'll go to a break in a moment\n[noise] yeah right I mean if you recall back er during Katrina gone way kind of in West spoke out against Trump\nOr I'm Sorry against so shy and that the ... but yet of black people and uh now it's just amazing the ... and that he's a for crop of a sudden now it's a mental illness and I'll sit down believable\nNo no well this is the again that because as as one of the caller said earlier it's almost like stromboli in in ... when the puppet is doing what you wanted to do yes yes this is great when the puppet cuts the strings then it's a problem\nLook I ... and this is why I'm not saying Kanye West is you know a a ... this is he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves I think there are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of\nYou know African Americans in in Republican circles will look to somebody like Clarence Thomas or a ... you know Walter Williams was somebody who really has a\nFull flashed philosophy on politics and race that is informed impassioned and thoughtful I think that's where you look\nBrown was shot it much them this is Gary rhyme a joined me this Saturday afternoon as the one I Panthers around the road and looking to take down south Dakota we'll start with the home of the Panthers dot com pre game show ... or ... is that\nHe is on the way you got another one I get up and that thing is\nFor the games they do for the lie call in show horrible\nYou and I versus South Dakota this Saturday on your home with the Panthers news talk this game forty K.
