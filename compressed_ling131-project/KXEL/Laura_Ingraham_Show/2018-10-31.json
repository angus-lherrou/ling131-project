New Jersey at the short of the stick for so long it's time for the people in New Jersey to get pushed first and and not some party or politics\nAnd in New Jersey is lucky that we've had the economic revival in the country because it's being dragged along and [noise] and it it would need to do things in New Jersey are going to focus on putting our state the right direction and higher taxes more government spending\nIs absolutely Dr ... not the solution to New Jersey it's the problem in New Jersey and and and and I tell you\nYou know we think that your children your grandchildren I have three kids my daughter works at your body over New York and my two sons are station to camp Pendleton California in the marine corps I Want them to be able to come back to New Jersey when the time comes that weren't raise a family et cetera\nThat's the role models that you want and and the and the policies make his own affordable\nAnd it's disrespectful to the people people chose are good people just deserve but it's time to restore honor and dignity integrity the office and that's where we're going to do on November the ... the\n... you get all kinds of you getting enough help from ah outside and I know New Jersey's like my home state fairly liberal even though there's conservative\nElements in conservative kind of pragmatism and in New Jersey but are are you getting enough help or you need it and if not and what type of outrage needs to be done in these final days to connect voters with a ride to the polls and so forth\nYou know ... you know\nPart part of the reason I'm I think we haven't gotten support or the Democrats have gotten a lot of ... Schumer's put about seven million of Senate ... an hour is a democratic senatorial campaign committee in his own majority pack into New Jersey and\nI think it's about ten or twelve twelve million dollars of outside Washington money against me we're up and we haven't had any any positive support financially and in terms of our campaign from the Washington Republicans but that's that's okay with us this was about the Jersey is\nBob Bob so they are as the whatever that's called didn't didn't give you any money or the or the or are in the lead in honey\nI'm no no virtually nothing I mean I I actually think it's like I think they did make a contribution to forty seven thousand dollars that I that I really like us ally that goes but for now but you know some but\nIt was you know that's a tough market in a New Jersey because he got ... in New York media market you know bleed and said you got any cash I mean the Democrats are laying out the cash and look at look at what you're doing with\nNo support outside support that'll just stunning that year within striking here\nWill tell you the truth Laura the last poll and we stopped pulling glass last night for the last night 'cause you don't want you to talk of change I think it's just it's just for curiosity ...\nActually last poll we had we trust because it had me down twenty to start Downey dumped five of them were were up to is the latest one that we really believe is the great poles so you could told us just testicle tied\nDid people were actually Neal you were pushed ahead here now and that\nMomentum is so clear you know how how do you justify voting for a guy who has had this track record in the bottom of the industry ... his best friend is convicted of sixty seven felonies for the ...

persistent\nSplitting opinion on what to do with this Iranian man that's where is Germany today given the fact that Merkel is out as her party\nA leader she's in our last term clearly opposition forces in Germany more populist a ... anti migration\nOur political on\nLower so far the German government has not changed his position that still wants to stay inside of the Jaycee pie away [noise]\nBut nearly every German company folks with real money at risk ... made the opposite decision they have fled they have left there beside of they're not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday [noise]\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I'm convinced that overtime or all of the European countries will come to see if that Iran is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the middle east and that we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that to fix it\nSo the sanctions going place on Monday correct\nYes ma'am Monday and they'll feel them immediately or will it take so little time to settle on\nUs or they are already feeling them but a mess the days go on the pressure will increase we will substantially drop the amount of crude all their primary revenue source that they could ship around the world a treasury will put back in place sanctions on financial institutions there [noise]\nAnd we hope that the things we put on individuals and in other places will convince the leadership we we walk the Iranian people to be successful we want this will be a successful country wants to restore democracy that we we think the Iranian people want that same thing\nAs our aim is not to harm the Iranian people but to change the behavior the malign activity of this regime\nAre just going back to Germany a boy have Merkel's fortunes changed obviously she'll be finishing up her last term but she's been there for Thirteen Years or so\nUh and uh she's leaving as a head of her party or how will that change our dealings with Germany and the in the near term and what do you see as the political climate in Europe with the rise of self ... in the challenges that you use facing\n[noise] so we have many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some more um we don't share the same view the president has been direct with respect to the European staking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that\nThe primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia creates hum a reside in Europe locked in America [noise]\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments evaluate system sees that America is with them were happy to assist them but they have the

cannot afford to take care of everybody in the cold it gets easier\nAnd if we do it's a crime against our own people\nOr a congressman or our back or the ... is the sad thing I think for so many Americans is how it's become a point of controversy for you to say or any of us to say we want the border and forced why that controversial that we want a border\n[noise] uh that uh we're gonna have to come to grips with is the ... people [noise]\nUh I Hope we're are observing this trying to figure out what's going to happen with their lives as this situation deteriorates having columns people

major issues but most things like that on the plus side\nThat I admired the president and the good job but he's been doing so that is an issue here\nHowever the the most important thing is is that my opponent you had a choice between my soap or the other person in the Democratic candidates are bureau and she or he basically\nDoes he was a newcomer to the area and he doesn't understand any of the things that go to the heart of what it's like to be just a discount this part of the country\nAnd I I grew up surfing along the beaches here but uh but uh I I went to high school here uh\nI'm a

announcing the reports of some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today it is\nTime we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless study right\nNow who could have been talking about his Nineteen Ninety five but there is no Fox News ... some of the airwaves or this is where he attempted to blame me everybody at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nBut at the White House felt some have they had their share of corrections say no we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network vessel we meant by angry voices on the

extraordinary one more by this is Wolf Blitzer and Jeffrey too but in the last night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI with the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the

remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests say\nSo now there were no protests for a bomb and there's no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of
