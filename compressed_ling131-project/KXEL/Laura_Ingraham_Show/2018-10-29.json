safety and prosperity a sound fiscal policy sound foreign policy that's directed to the betterment of the American people\nIt's fantastic when the world is doing well it's great when a other countries' prosperity is is rising but the president point when he when he says you know America First of all he means is all just like with other countries are policies are going to be directed to making our lives better\nThan anti Semitic not racist it's pro American\nAnd for a lot of folks out there the idea of being ... you're pro American itself as offensive\nThey don't they don't like this idea that you're pro American they think America is the best country in the face of the earth because that means that you by implication are criticizing other countries and that and said we need to be

with the ... it's just a desperate last minute push for voters in mid term cycle where the Democrats might not win as many seats as I thought to me that's the cynical play here is bringing Trump into\nYou're listening to your healthy radio addiction we continue\n[noise] ranger you actually are\n\n\nYou guys can do the outrageously expensive little blue pill is now generic which means you can get the\nI'm supports students for justice and Palestine is left wing group a nobody does anything about it so you know\nBlaming Donald Trump\nOr just exposes a the bankruptcy of the left and the Democratic party in particular but I think the more they try to blame Trump for everything or the less credibility they have\nThe more people will listen to what Trump is saying that's my view\nThere was a um we'll get to this moment they were trying to drag the former rabbi and the current rabbi of the tree of life synagogue into you know political conversation I'll get to that in a moment but\nThe the never Trump of former conservatives I don't know if they were ever conservatives again on CNN Today use this as an opportunity to trying to smear the President Bill Kristol spoke let's listen\nIf that's the president wanted to come to our synagogue this week and make some talk I Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate and that's you know we don't need him\nWe don't need him to help us overcome this right here we don't need him but they're still in office there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think there is an opportunity for him to to speak out a and to anticipate accountability for\nCrystal ... these people and there are truckers are just desperate to justify their positions says Trump has done everything that conservatives wanted them to want it actually not only am but Republican presidents to do fridge that their numbers\nThe thing that conservatives have wanted them to want it actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done\nSo the only thing they can do is uh assassinate his character which is what they\nCall it simply do this is ridiculous\nThe uh you know ... one one comment oh and I I've I forget it was in response to her question which elicited the smart one could be done you said it would be ... have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue there were security guards and lots of synagogues\nPerfectly wise recommendation\nGovernment attack by the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh the forward magazine which is an extreme left wing Jewish magazines blame him he said that Trump blamed the synagogue and blamed the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point\nA they're a nut cases out there uh who will kill\nA and a synagogue and other other Senate schools should be defended but the Democrats than the left or so the reins over gun control issues that it practical steps like this are hard to take\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue a tree of life synagogue\nWas also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset about the media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view\nThis evil anti teams an anti Trump\nA fanatic the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify the airwaves you hear ways but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me on the synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen\nTo welcome the president to Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hey things\nThe hypocritical um where'd that come from hemp ... tell me nothing um we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is leaving values not just curious how you believe in values and those are not the values of presidents and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh or the current\nEvent that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say that is in June the Jews are out to lunch with these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\n... Donald Trump ... ah you know is of counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate yet for any group nothing like I mean I\nTurn on MSNBC the other day a on the coal law set a panel every single there were four people on the panel was the Trump and said I I'm a nationalist and\nEvery single one of them linked that adults Hitler why because ... and every one of them said nationalist this dictator\nWell actually no I chose this mess see any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who claim nationalism is a Democrat they just won't find any pretext\nTo link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC you said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that's translates into Hitler the hate against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump\nTrump Trump this kind of actually funny and as a tax 'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing well but these people they have dug themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party\nHas gone to war against the legitimate ... elected president a resistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy for political party ... we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon the Gallup\nEstimate is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds there were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi who insist\nOn demonizing the president of United States which is something that hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush too they called Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control in off the rails\nAnd a ... you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are some ... silver Democrats but there and intimidated by the party left now um but that they will come out of the closet\nJeffrey ... I have one and ... yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier ... yeah Jeffrey Myers says the current rabbi\nOr who of course is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people he's worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like this\nRabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of the team for him to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome 'em\nSome citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome\nThat's a good answer Neal you know every time I go I go to a synagogue I look around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause the universities are teaching June hatred\nThey they ... and our university the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally\nIs that you know the Jews stole land the Arab land which isn't to genocide ally\nThe land on which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the

one of the president\nCan't talk about the caravan President Trump can't criticize the [noise]\nThe media a President Trump can't do any of those [noise]\nBecause to do so and stoke the acts of an anti Semite [noise]\nPresident just earlier this year was cold called anti Palestinian\nUh when he decided to move that embassy to Jerusalem us embassy to Jerusalem how could you do this\nYou're now you're insulting at their core the Palestinian people and there's going to be an uprising as a result of this and not have been out there wasn't an uprising as a result listen to some people are unhappy some people are not unhappy\nBut I think this happened before where ... and I said it's been one of my angles last week on Fox that the goal here is to turn Trump into a conventional politician\nI don't think that's going to happen\nJust not a conventional politician he's going to do things the way he thinks they're going to resonate that's where the people are going to advance his agenda consumer spending by the way way up consumer confidence way up\nA three point five percent GDP last month even with some of the head when this economy it's faced a it's all very good news for this country All right we're going to take a break a with a lot more to get to Rhonda Santa's going to join us of course he wants to a win that Senate seat against Andrew Gillum and uh\nUh well no I mean excuse me the governorship obviously against Andrew Gillum and focus on the bill Nelson race against a former governor part of the current governor outgoing governor\nAnd Brock Obama is in the state this weekend so he's going to end this week you're going to be campaigning for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson the both the gubernatorial and Senate seats open a in a tight say they're\nBeing forty injury I mean\n\n\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to call the airbags in their vehicles\nWhat issue right now at this moment in time or is motivating the voters in Florida many are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important I think it's\nProtecting Florida trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase that I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problems solved which require consultation with the federal government or if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime\nThey've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee when he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in Tallahassee history\nAnd I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because at the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked\nLaw enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities in abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow in a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection the Senate or in Florida how concerned are you about\nThe allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\n[noise] some I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me and he does for for\nAndrew because I think folks will ah who may not otherwise one vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak or when it comes to the ... regime and Venezuela\nSo I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down and don't forget you know we have the president\nOf the United states coming down on October thirty first uh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida\nAnd then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz and Texas\nUm you know that put the race away for Ted but I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is um silver Tunde order I mean it's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice to 'em\nAbout how about our by political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tested he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does I don't think he doesn't do it in nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen my grandmother\nUsed to say I have a dog will holler\nMissile defenses has spoken first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at racist conferences not calling miss the dissenters races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the our ... our\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today\nUm there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel these anti Israeli organization supporting Gillum the ... and you know he sign sign this pledge called dream defenders hum I planted my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers\nAre of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of\nCourse I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond [noise] oh yeah\nLike I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew is the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott digestion sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they have special trips or just the target Israel on and so\nWhat we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a boycott it Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and presidents have no place in justice\nUm and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he said I'm In terms of the pledge he signed on but I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner and of course that's the FBI agent as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks but want to Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nThat's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message just showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton was actually paid for by and undercover FBI agent who he thought was a was a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago\nThat that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote it almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nature then governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nUm disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigated written being investigated but\nI Would ask the question what other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its palms with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting of pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating Gillum that'd be\nDid you have for Greece and its palm a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting of pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating don't that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation you've been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith policy I only went down to some really simple in these last closing days it's just lazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politician jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurants it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida than definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed uh Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled it's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership it's not\nIt is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nOr you heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you've got ... diagram that sends\nBut the but it looks like Floridians and the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life and the state better thirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent\nSaid it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states ah thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants and the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on they care about\nWell this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstances near its refuge they've they rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday that we need to welcome in the Caribbean and in the United states um and so you couldn't you have a more stark difference um for borders Andrew stroke and borders\nIs Donald Trump the Rush Limbaugh show live today at

that is it it's a common sense issue someone's truly are of a religious refugee that's completely different than people just saying it's crush the nails and said I'm coming because I Want a better way

on and another that I'm behind on about five thousand dollars like interest rates have hang between Eighteen and twenty two\nNot supporting conservative causes and that's led a state attorney general West Virginia Patrick Morrisey\nOr to ah be on the verge of defeating the ...\nBut we still have a week to go he joins us now uh it's good to have you on Mr Morsi how are you\nI'm doing great Laura thanks for having me on your program today\nAbsolutely a let's talk about the effort to blame the president his rhetoric his language for this horrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all fall you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's basically on Capitol Hill and the house\nAnd in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton who says she's incapable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this president down and they're going to take\nThe most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have\nRespect for this president who has done so much to restore American credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had the guts\nGo and follow through\nTo make Jerusalem the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but they will find any way to pick at President Trump\nFortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support he won the election by forty two points when I get elected I'm going to be a conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda\nAnd separately the reason why people are fleeing from Joe mansion\nIs he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be a first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWell why um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance and the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why ... is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast to let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some ... ... ... is not pro life a match and supports Planned Parenthood\nNatural supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all is that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe mansion and the more people learn about his actual record not his rhetoric\nFor what he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest Washington liberal ... when they move away from 'em so it's an educational process\nWhat about the um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the Kavanaugh um hearings Joe mansion or voted for cabin on the end but a man that I think most people just saw that as just an\nExample of rank unfairness and treating some time treating someone who's ... says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first call on the Senate floor\nMaps and took a powder and in fact he only came back to vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia should cast a vote there should be the leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe Manchin could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier
