an alternative we're all human efforts fail it's not given to us to be a final option but a first step but it's a gift approval is given to us by our great God meant to be our go to in on matters of life\nPrayer is a having a relationship with the creator of the universe connecting with him\nWe were made and redeemed for communion with him through prayer it's an important part of the process of walking with God and growing in our relationship with God and serving him in this world\nYet sometimes we struggle with prayer don't why perhaps out of disappointment from past attempts at it we set it aside or maybe there's a lack of discipline in our lives are just plain old forgetful mess life gets busy and we get distracted\nAnd we're all the poor for it\nWhen we do that\nOur series the is a a couple of great reasons to pray for answering the question why bother with praying in last week's message we learned a great reason to pray is because Nehemiah prayed and look what happened\nAnd today the answer to that question is because the early church did\nEarlier we read a story from acts chapter twelve\nRather exciting story it's a time of persecution and violence against the early church in Jerusalem it was now not only under attack from a a Jewish population that didn't want them around now it was under attack by the government\nIt appears that James the brother of John was arrested in be headed by king named Herod why because\nHeritage approval ratings need to go up amongst the Jewish population he's run happy times there was a family they didn't like the Romans anyway and he was looking for ways to keep the Jewish majority happy and peaceful\nHe knew their dislike of Christians so getting rid of one of the leaders of the church would causes approval ratings to shore among the population\nIt works so well we see in our story for the day that he had Peter arrested another leader and scheduled to go on trial and be beheaded\nRefined Peters surrounded by sixteen soldiers in a prison he's in change things are in a bad way the leadership of the church Jews\nOn the line and the future the kingdom cars seem to be\nIn question so what did these early Christians do did they panic and scatter no the church gathered and prayed for Peter it says\nNow the night before Peterson trial and execution while the churches prayed for God's help and this and in an intervention of some sort we're told [laughter] theater sound asleep while they're praying\nPeter sleeping but God wasn't\nPeters so showing with a bright light suddenly and an angel pope Peter in the side woke him up and said get up let's go get dressed and three miracles occurred the chains fell off his hands and feet\nAll sixteen of the guards that were supposed to keep an eye on him left is Peter walked right by them\nAll the while thinking that he was just happy to dream big iron gate open all by itself and Peter and his rescue we're headed down the street but Peter turned to say something to his escape partner\nPartner disappeared and then Peter realizes\nThis wasn't a dream the Lord's rescued me\nHe runs to the house church it's been praying for him and the doors walk\nHe can hear the praying inside I imagine Peter knocks on the door calls out\nA little servant lady named wrote or who would come to the door here's this voice as he's calling out and she's so surprised and overjoyed she runs to tell the others but these Peter standing outside the door she tells the other's\nAbout this and they tell her you're out of your mind you're out of touch with reality\nThe door she tells the other's about this and they tell her you're out of your mind you're out of touch with reality you're just seeing things maybe it's ... or maybe he's dead already\nIn the meantime Peter keeps knocking on Mary store looking over his shoulder I imagine sweating bullets by now because he thought there'd be a search party out looking for him to arrest him again\nFinally they listen to road and they go to the door and they open it and their stance Peter and everyone there is shocked\nTo see Peter standing there alive and well they start talking amongst themselves and then he silences them and he tells them about how the lord brought him out of the prison\nAnd he's in instructed them to go into James the brother of Jesus was also a big leader and the church at that time like Peter and tell other believers as well so that they might be encouraged by it\nThat they might be renewed by the thought that God\nReally is with us and for us in all of this even during dark times and then Peter went on his way to do ministry elsewhere it's an amazing story\nBut this is more than just a great adventure story to entertain us to\nCause us to enjoy and marvel at how God used to do these sorts of things it's not safe for entertainment friends it's safer are at a vacation is God's people in Christ is part of his church\nBecause first of all it serves as a wonderful reminder to us of the great lesson faithfulness of the gods to whom we pray\nThis God here's an answers prayer he is active in this world there is no hands off approach on the part of God\nAnd as the him says this is my father's world he is in charge his will will be done with the wrong seems also strong God is a ruler yet\nYou see this little episode is part of a bigger story\nRemember the beginning of the book back when Jesus said to his disciples now wait in Jerusalem for that power to come from an high and then you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and today and all the ends of the earth\nIn other words he told them God has plans for this good news to be spread all over the world it's going to happen\nAnd then this story as we find guts church under duress with a cane thinks he's in charge and going to shut this thing down at with the league leader Peter being captive to him God steps in\nIn the end of this story as you read on Herod dies doesn't he ends eaten by worms and Peter is alive\nThe gospel continues to spread to the ends of the earth and more and more people come to trust in Jesus Christ when all is said and done by the end of this episode God his one\nAlways has always does he always will his purposes will not be thwarted the gospel the good news of Christ life and death and resurrection\nCould not be silenced and cannot be silenced it just keeps going on and on\nAnd we see that God loves his church that's a theme that comes out in this story\nAs he involves himself with his people so the first thing is is great picture of a faithful God who's in charge\nThe next thing that comes up in this story I think it's meant to it's meant to encourage us to pray more boldly to anticipate God's answers to be on the lookout for them\nThe surprises these praying Christians in the story when Peter shows up the house church shows that they weren't expecting anything to come up they're praying maybe they just thought this was just too impossible of a situation so when they hear that Peter's at the door they go you're out of your mind\nBut they were again taught that our God is lord of the impossible didn't day he's specializes in great escape so I mean look at the empty to him on Easter Jesus was dead behind that to mend the door was open\nAny walked out but let's not be too hard on them don't we perhaps sometimes prey with pretty low expectations\nPaul's Waterloo, Iowa area down to seven seven zero nine or [noise]\nWe're happy you chose to worship with us this day and pray you will join us again next Sunday ... station conducting

way\nWhen I entered politics I used to think that uh [noise]\nThere are a lot of analogies between politics and sports but both very competitive things go if you have to do a lot of preparation a

to\nGo on line I Will watch dot org\nDollars and Ninety two cents per thousand dollars that you borrow for your principal and the interest so hundred thousand dollar home you're looking at a five hundred and Ninety two dollars a month payment\nFor principle an interest in the course do that you have to ask for your taxes and your homeowner's insurance so kind of get a price point in mind that you're comfortable with and you could share that with your with your here at exit when we're helping you look for a whole\nAnother thing you might want to consider doing is you might want to say your first time through their homes maybe not bringing in a whole entourage are bringing the kids all but I like it is my ... and say okay here's the deal we got ten homes that were going to look at we're going to have ten minutes and each one when I don't want to know if you go to buy that house\nI just wanted was worth coming back to him and that way will pare down this whole list of homes or looking to so hopefully we can get into your favorite home maybe two or three times before you make a decision and on that final time if it's meant to cut\nHer that third and final time that me the time to bring your parents through maybe aunt and uncle's and the kids so everybody sees what you're seriously considering that stays everybody a lot of time and they'll make the experience more enjoyable because you know what if you can't have fun working with\nUs here in age if you don't want to work with anybody you just want to have some fun to be relaxed and know that the confidence that you're with people that know what they're doing another thing I heard my wires to do is respect sellers privacy gay\nSoldiers are still living at home it's okay to open closet doors and covered doors and check for space and stuff but there really isn't any reason to be opening dresser drawers are spending a lot of time looking in their personal space\nOkay or the other thing is I always enjoyed some buyers right up front and the real estate agents always assume when you're in a house today with modern technology like it is that you're either being recorded audio early or visually or both\nSo you may want to be very careful wanting to drowsy and only say positive things\nThat's so true [laughter] the only thing I Would encourage all my viruses take lots of notes so when I meet up with a buyer I'm going to have\n... seats in the lifting sheets gave you the explanation and description but the realtors have put in for a house\nAnd I also have a populist and she's for buyers that way you can make the nose right on those seeds and I just tell people that if you want to come back we'll put a smiley face on it if you don't put a friendly face on it and we throw that went away and that's how we pare down from down to three and a one day showing experience\nSome things that you might want to stay away from is you may not want to look at houses that are above your budget there's no sense of falling in love with something that you can't have or you don't qualify\nFor at this point it's always best if you get like a twenty four hour notice before you want to get into a house that gives both the sellers and the agents time to get the appointments set up there just sellers time to put their best foot forward because\nYou know showing the house is like a job interview sure a person to only get one chance to make that first impression so if you were selling the house you want your house look very best to so let's give folks and a chance to make that possible to make our experience and their experience a lot more enjoyable\nAnd speaking about given the chance of being respectful of their time\nReally kind of touchy to cancel it the last minute okay so if we've got to cancel showing or rearrange the time the more notice we can give that summer the better off we're going to be and then of course we don't want to stay in the house too long I mentioned one time earlier that I told my folks ten minutes is all it takes and decide you want to come back or not\nSo that will be your first showing and then second or third showings in those houses we may stay a little bit less time than the normal so that's why I got real estate wise we have time to talk about what's going on in the community\n... why do we got a October here\nThat's what I got real estate wise we have time
