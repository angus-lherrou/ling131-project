they can turn Georgia to fully\nA Philly blue and that will be a wall against Trump in twenty twenty what's the key to turning out voters and getting them to see the great a danger\nOf a democratic takeover of Georgia\nWell I think they're waking up now is one of the things is concerned about a third base wasn't as motivated as Democrats were but with the Kavanaugh's confirmation with states statements like these people are finally realizing the wrist Stacey Abrams you know when somebody is going to\nHaving fundraisers in San Francisco\nThirty days out from election you know doing fundraisers with Cory Booker made she said this crazy statement about the undocumented folks being part of the only way if she was with Elizabeth Warren of all the overall folks in the state of Georgia campaign for governor\nPeople are realizing that that is not our values that is you know we're we're literally in a battle for the soul of our state applied for our future and it's not only about Lee and twenty a day and that's about our state it's about our country\nAnd we're going to die hard I Will say that we saw a great turnout on our from our base yesterday and the first\nThe first of ballots that were cast it early voting songs Kurds and all that ... you know and they even put it all of the road Georgia's don't agree with on citizens boating in our elections they don't agree with given free college tuition citizens I don't agree with given\nHOPE Scholarship so it is our educational scholarship to those that are here illegally when folks to stand up or it's a better word literally as you said by the rest of the country sixty five percent of her money has come from out of state this election\nI have to ask you about this caravan situation a because once again the Democrats are trying to play the\nEmotional manipulation game on this issue where the victims of illegal immigrant crime and the United states get almost no coverage in the mainstream media but the you know the tails and the lows of individuals who are making a long and dangerous track from Central America to our southern border\nAre you know their catalog and then they're chronicled like you know something out of a Charles curl a Sunday CBS Sunday Morning you know special\n[laughter] well and and that's what that's what people are so frustrated on all at our state but on our country they're ready for governor it's got to put them first of the special interest that meant a former\nDirector for ISIS force but under the Obama administration called Stacey Abrams to get out of the race after this outlandish comment that she made and you know over the weekend she was doing the Sunday talk shows up at the city or New York or wherever she was\nYou know I was down in southwest Georgia on Saturday back again this morning where we literally have are farmers that are family suffering for her ... you know that's what this race is about them about the Georgians versus about put our country first\nA head of those that are here illegally and no no no one has or sympathy for people and their their flights in their country but\nYou know we have to protect our own we have to have secure borders we cannot go to other countries and get free government healthcare we could not go to other countries and get you know free education I got three teenage daughter so you know it it's going to cost billions to do all these\nRadical things that Stacey Abrams wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on artwork George ... like four and people are tired of that they're waking up their turn it out and we're going to put that red ...\nBut we need conservatives across the country to join the fight like others are doing to help or\nYou know drive the socialist radical liberal agenda go to jail for governor dot com and helpless if they can't or with their prayers also their pocketbooks and they were in the ... of our life is not only about ... about twenty twenty as oil\nYeah camp for governor dot com camp for governor dot com go to that website\nHealth about Brian because he has American first on the brain which is where what we need it to be we need the situation handled in a humane and smart way but your your focus is to care for the people of Georgia people of of this country and we cannot be good to anyone\nIf we'd dilute what we have\nWith a porous border and absurd immigration loophole ... essentially results and catch and release which is what the president is so frustrated about uh Brian I have\nTo play for you something that Stacey Abrams is a beating on pretty hard which is the claim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course complain both ways but ah we're gonna play this and get your reaction much less than\nFifty three thousand people that are being forced to go through\nUnnecessary hurdles to prove their bona fide east but the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine county thousands of volunteering paid coworkers who are going to be asked to ... verified that these IDs are sufficient and the challenges there is this this is the subject is standard\nIt would be much easier if he actually did his job and ... people in a popper fashion and we did not have the ... system\nUh your reaction to that uh the the law that's being matching from a license driver's licenses to voter rolls\nThey claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising are suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell no this was shockey law but I'm following the state law that we have is Georgia for clarification process because we believe that we should do not support this that we should clarify who individuals are before we register to vote that's why we have a stick like the\nUS citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state\nOr this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand for a reelection governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout of Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most votes cast in our state so I don't see how that voters suppression\nRight before this outrageous claims came with an ounce that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before the state of Georgia\nBecause we have things like online voter registration I pushed the general assembly and implemented a secretary of state years ago we have eight thousand more people on our roles now that we had when I\nTook office she voted against online voter registration she does not support our common sense photo out the lawsuit voted against our citizenship to\nThe counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because they have permission from her local groups is not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location show there\nYeah but the vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license\nAnd they can vote so that is not a hot hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper type or register to vote\nAnd if they had used our own line system they never had any of this problem to start with so she's blaming me for problem she created a and she'd blame it made for following state law and that's why I think\nGeorgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen this all they're doing this to dry out their base out\nBut it's working in reverse because the Republican base that conservative base and hard work and Georgia is going to reject a solo on November the ...\nAh well the the argument is that well if you have a letter missing in your name ... methods like Laura a Ingram versus Laura

it's it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nWell look Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always thinking moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who won ya um and and so you you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's list right that's a joke but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house and maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nWell I mean like the upside you know\nThat the Republican white act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but\nWhat I said except maybe we'll give them some courage right you see you see leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now\nI fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in its speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in twenty eight teen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but\nI was going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnd Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change\nThe stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then heart and ultimately released because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWhoa that's prosecuted for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the Clinton emanates real Salvador\nOh that is why they're saying we're feared alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nYeah well again I think that's you and you seemed ... you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people are like we we got cities with with homeless a villages tent villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ooh we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that you take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with a with rage about the situation\nA congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV tone will take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate\nUh against affirmative action I don't go\nTo\nBill O'Riley here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nOf it uh uh this uh this weekend I spoke at an end to affirmative action Rawley with Edward Blum he's the president of students for fair admissions which is suing Harvard\nAbout basically diversity has become a justification for racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites at Harvard according to Harvard zone admissions data or they reduced Asian American ... for forty three percent to Eighteen percent uh through a complicated ... a\nDiverse if a ... nation scheme and in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nA an eternal team back looted they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury the report that's on trial right now and uh one important point I Want to make your audience today is that\nHarvard receives billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you well\nI Am so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism type of racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I end the Supreme Court's Fisher decision or you know\nAffirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism [noise] um and it it has a huge impact on admissions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the\nBelief that diversity is the founding principal of America a is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity is the founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\n... founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and their law in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be a Supreme Court and then the Michigan formative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to be one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got it to medical school and dropped out\nYou see it leaves a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education you just\nLet people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that now you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete ah based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well uh this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nLaughing is not about protecting America and bought by an anti civil rights act of that scene had were well mine rights activists who was trying to bring down marrying someone writes accents and American society how and ultimately about him\nAnd go home and bring down some of the nation that is\nActually designed to increase their angry containing increase there are the guys that are for everyone which is kind of America as well\nUh your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder\nTo get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard clause like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard or lose an Asian American there is an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America\nWho got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those sequels spoke at the Asian American coalition a for educations rally or just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in\n... there was a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down uh\nIt it it comes down to a ... it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court ah we have the Justice Department who is on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action uh so because we have this powerful la ... who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nAn invasive as this is how they're going to go on for some time\nOn the federal district court level then to a court of appeals and ah if they determine the circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating are we going to get you on TV you gotta come on TV with us soon a v J in them now his book almost black a true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black or what\nThink about this the the it's racial been counting and the words of some it's contrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society\nA and does it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others are instead of just respect for talent\nDoes it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others I instead of just respect for talent in individual merit aid five five forty Laura your reaction to this and a lot more coming up\nWhether or\nNot you're for or against affirmative action still important how many of action negatively and get Asian American groups and you can be for me that I can tell the critical and high rate and this\nLaura Ingraham show\nTalk to\nThem\n\nAnd auctions trading and bump

if\nSomething happens that'll make Donald Trump\nSelf destruct they've been telling us this since prior to the presidential election they've been telling us since the campaign since Trump came down the escalator\nThree years ago June of two thousand Fifteen the media has been telling it ... noted the experts in the Washington establishment have been telling us and its Trump just got a self destruct\nSomething's gonna happen and drugs going to blow up everybody's going to see who the real trumping is and everybody's going to be shocked and surprised and sad mood and then everybody's gonna want Trump's swept away but it never happens\n\nIt never happens in death [laughter] we keep watching his his critics self destruct Trump's opponents melt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump is melting down\nThey melt down over to the fact that they can't make Trump melt down\nWages example Pocahontas herself you want to talk about melting down and self destruction you are looking at it\nElizabeth Warren you don't want I think I think there are there are four women here that attempted essentially an October surprise against Donald Trump they've all bummed out where the Hillary Dianne Feinstein focus on us and who is the other\nThere's there's one other woman they mounted things these are in October and all of these I think we're\nDestined to to to destroy Trump\nAnd by extension the Republicans of course Dianne Feinstein running the balls the foreign scandal as an October surprise a Hillary Clinton and and and her constant a need Lincoln products out there she's got something planned and always has happened it always blows up on her face\nAnd now Elizabeth Warren ... is is melting down over this claim that she is an Indian\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can set the terms\nBased on their level of expertise that experience or whatever it is they're applying for none of this\nIn the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote and yet\nThere isn't a federal Lipton band of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six game presidential election\n\nFor those of us shouting at me why but what was known for Sylvia when we won the popular vote by three\n... yeah but two things about that most of those votes came from California the second thing is that we had a story yesterday that there are three and a half million\nRegistered voters above the number of bodies in America have been about orders are three and a half million more registered voters then there are voters\n\nMeans there's all kinds of voter fraud potential fraud taking put but even those who thinks throw them out it doesn't\nIt doesn't cancel a fact of the Democrats have been losing elections left and right now we have they couldn't stop cabinet every October surprise that they tried to mount has blown up in their face and Elizabeth Warren is just the latest one and this one is a giant\nPresident here's somebody to build\nSome thinking I'm going to expand on this of course but but I I'm thinking nothing is chances for rock Obama ruins the Democratic party but rock Obama is no reason that they lost twelve hundred seats nationwide there hasn't been anything to change that they lost the Supreme Court they lost Kavanaugh they did everything they could\nThey mounted October surprise they trying to destroy the lights the career of the past the future of Brett Kavanaugh to save the court nothing\nIs going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate earring it's something you'd never Trump person but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen the Democrats attempt ...\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up probably the first standing out in his career\nTo get the kind of crowds would they want that you may think rush to enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest\nFolks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton according to draw fly just do a book selling\nParty she couldn't draw applies to campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would've been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons\nCompanies not waiting with bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the Google data analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he\nWent to five thirty eight and then he went to Vioxx and back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells them for example Nate Silver on election night two thousand sixteen five PM\nGave Hillary Clinton calling an eighty nine percent chance of being elected president so they were all thinking it was over in the same thing is happening now Democrats Seventy three percent chance of retaking the house of representatives\nDemocratic voters breathing a sigh of relief Nate Silver is continuing report that he was on\nUm the FiveThirtyEight dot com politics podcast and the host was Jody ... Oregon who is a guy\nAnd the question has the gender gap increased since\n... a lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in almost social\nNetworks right especially for Republicans wearing the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male test hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit of improved to the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of some of the cabinet nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats and all of these house races the Democrats are assuring their voters are locks\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of them are too close to call this isn't it in the bag for them but they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base and they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten Brock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump won once they found was ...\nBetween two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen they continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they bought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand four teen midterms Obama won\nWell didn't even get when he was on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year\nWe're not the grand sweep\nFor Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss upstaged by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency and the Democrats have the least amount of electrical power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\n\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... and the Democrats the comeback show up and re take everything they lost all the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else Democrat Party\nThat much more bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obama Karen all of the spending that\nEnergized but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along ... there was nothing Obama was doing the economy was a flap line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had the vote against it they did except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component two thousand twelve now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever happens to those are the Nineteen twenties\nHas suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaves it's hatred for his hairstyle it's hatred because of his mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us all gr this massive Democrat blue\nWave there is no trend that suggest Democrat blue wave\nPlus Trump is do you live in the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver life here from the same podcast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual were also I always says what are in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nAnd both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there is a forty percent chance that one of those two productions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nLike this for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he told me he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitting he's never seen a split\nLike this he's talking about Democrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate\nHe is never seen anything like that he'd have I don't know how to factor is that we consider it a toss up pits forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's telling because he has a good way to find out what's going to happen this election and he and there were you nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea\nWhat's going to happen here no he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the time of the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns\nWhen they start throwing their numbers around and their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever had a split in the forecast is\nPretty unusual yeah a lot of things are on your shoulders time aren't they need to be unusual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it to predict is likelihood of a split as unusual we um you know I always say uh when we're in the eighty twenty zone\nAnd we're now in the eighty twenties on in both places that makes me nervous meaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when my house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous\nThat we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there is a forty percent chance that one of those two British was going to be wrong [laughter]\nWell there is a pretty good education the Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't win a Senate ah when how he doesn't know he's nervous\nHis analysts telling you if it's a twenty both sides but they don't know it's fifty fifty fifty fifty\nYou might not even show up and go to work folks have all all of your analysis in all your data collection produces it can go either way then why is anybody paying you\nRush Limbaugh going the way I used to be more\n[noise]\nHeard and this is this the stock market report staple wealth management at investment banking much
