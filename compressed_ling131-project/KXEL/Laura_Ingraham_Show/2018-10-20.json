said okay then I got the other room and the first thing that looks like they're crazy things wrong and they're still at odds with each other that they're not missing that just plain these highly against each\nOther and you see from things\nThat he had the insight to have access going on\nThrough different political parties at holy station it's the same dynamic foods just blame the other which is so you're the top and we've got to change and hit on change with it has some serious problems says his first inside with the same thing that goes on between two people that are going on\nAnd then the second thing that he did that is a great faith in greater was to say All right we've got two for housing for us\nAnd then the second thing that he did that says ... faith and said it was to say

understand one another and find where do we have common ground but in that\nBut it's not where they make it very clear these guys heard over and over its not when you say when you come into one of our workshops it's not when nobody's change their views\nAre not try to make everybody a moderate or ... we we respect your view is what we're only thing we're asking at the start is listening to the other side was an open mind with using the tools of marital series yeah\nBut if you're doing that was the goal of that because just listening again each other doesn't move the needle but when you're trying to get some sort of agreement to\nAffect policy ... that's a very good question\nBecause I'm saying is that when you ... and just finding the other than you saw in ... so that you're open to new possibilities to find to generate\nNew resolution we'll suggest since ... we do have common ground and that's built on that and see how can we make this work\nSo that it does help people when they can come together instead of an antagonistic and mine said that when an understanding and openness okay we have all this and come and how can they brought the cat\nShifted you have something that\nWell the way you framed her question I think reveals kind of a misunderstanding of what I was a fundamental problem in American society which is really not so much the political process solutions but the\nThe fraying social fabric where the American people are looking at one another as enemies or his adversaries versus as friends and neighbors\nAnd so the way you pose the question how does that move the needle how does that that that will benefit is just the release intention that benefits just looking at another human being in the eyes and talking about what's most personal to you and that alone relieves a lot of attention that we're feeling\nAs soon as I was like wait until you're talking about is almost a neighborhood of community building and getting some of\nThat fact

listen and have the humidity gauge it in a respectful\nDiscussion especially if there's contention correct and you know as soon as contentious and I'd like to take a just a slightly different angle on how I got into it because for years I\nHave been raised a daughter and gone through you know it's like have political discussions with her and\nI sort of always took it as prior to be able to say you know there's another side it's not all ... everything isn't one sided and I always say there's another side and and I we would get into this and for me I ran across the book\nCalled the three languages of politics by Arnold clean out of the mighty\nAnd he made it observation at the beginning of the book but she says as a ... in political cartoon rotations or political discourse there's three goals you can have one is for your side you can try to convince your side it's you're good you know what what's good about your side you can try to convince\nYour side the other side is bad\nOr you can try to convince the other side that you were site as good if you take it you know two sided thing and is it unfortunately Ninety percent of everything you see\nIn ... products that number who knows is look how bad they are ... and you know\nExaggerated example of something on the other side and look how bad that is\nAnd when you're demonizing the eat each side nothing is really happening

even after a few weeks and Wendy ground or in favor of it either but the are the most part what work than there are getting everything and the and the box or hang together stole or making Congress about why\nHow what is the uh the quality of the corn that you're pulling out is a pretty decent we've had fears that the the the quality could be suffering for for the weather we've been having\nWild for us to northern Iowa qualities that you know maybe one or two for ... uh the one thing we had a um a majority of our heavy rain all earlier on your lap back to the air to wear\nPark that paid had over six to ... and I think that's where your stand war the great quality issues\nNow are you seeing a it was just basically field conditions of the drying out enough for you guys to ... to do a decent job or are you still battling somewhat spot salt in those fields\nOr yesterday I our rights are being killed I did I actually went up through boxes standing water um it was all the ... and a

importance of having the proper air filter in changing it on a regular basis a lot of information Whitey known yet today's homeowner dot com\nAnd this little um it it um indoor air quality to brought to you by her own\nNew Tom ... right now let's see if we can get right to the phones Evelyn is in Washington state Evelyn welcome to the ... radio show\nOh thank you for having a good what's going on at your house there in Washington\nWell [laughter] oh really oh it's a lot more than I ever notice any my own and I've been in about five or six calls\nHa ha it's accumulating in the\nCarpet in the bath tub which I think and just all over all over throughout the house now and usual\nLarger mouth\nWhile our our our listeners across the country are you going to think we stack to these call up here but I was just talking about uh this very thing well let me ask you about your house um is it up on piers so you've got across space underneath\nWe do have a space it it's ... it's actually carved into to heal part of it and we do have a space however if we can walk up\nUnderneath that they actually and I actually went under there today women today\nOkay so so you have a fair amount of space there and I'm now do you have any plastic on the ground\nThere is some plastic however I notice that there are areas where it uncovered\nOkay because you know what happens so often I'm is when you have\nIt happens with very dry soil as well as wet soil in that\nThat water can migrate up into your home causing moisture mildew problems but along the same type of path you can have a very dusty conditions and what happens is your house some ... let me ask you in a more questions um you have central air and hate system we do okay\nDusty conditions and what happens is your house a well let me ask you in a more questions you have central air and hates us some weight you okay so so you have a return air system in your home that is polling air into and through a filter\nAnd then it's being filtered hopefully whale and then going through your ... system to distribute the heat or the cool throughout the entire\nHouse so that creates a pressure that that that a suction this polling from all areas of your home matter of fact a lot of people are surprised to know that every cubic foot of air in your home\nPasses through that filter\nTwo to three times per hour\nThink about think about that so Iowa cubic foot all this space all this air you have is going through that one little bitty innocent filter two or three times an hour now but it's also because of the pressure if that duck or if like your return air\nIs not sealed completely under the house or in the attic or wherever then each polling whatever it can grab\nInto the duck or in spreading it all throughout your house so that's one of the first line of defense is first of all make sure you have a good quality electric static filter costs you twelve to Fifteen bucks\nSure you're changing that at least two to three or at least every two to three months and okay and and and and then\nReally need to inspect that um have a air conditioning guy tell them what you're concerned about tell them that I mentioned that you might have some dust this being pulled into the system and can they please make sure that it's sealed properly because I'll bet that's what's causing that distribution of dust and\nAnd the ... of dust\nThroughout the entire area that's usually what makes that happen\nOkay okay I Do have it in a nearly a we'll ask him\nThat I mean I really do think that's probably the case there and I like I say that filter or will make a big difference in trying to cut it down but if there's a branch or a leak somewhere else and I called the ...\nArea of the air conditioning system that so that filter won't help at all but a check that out have them check it out thoroughly and I'll bet you'll be able to cut down on your dusting time\nOh okay All right [laughter] ... s shape your Evelyn\nThanks so much for being with us here on today's homeowner if we can help me any other way just to let us know\nOkay thank you very much I appreciate\nAlright are pleasure wow we're talking about um indoor air

decker ... and I think you'll see that it will hold it better than it ever has before that make sense\nIt does he have a preference between ah latex or oil based\n[noise] well I'll tell you I've always enjoyed using the um oil base hum on something like this but there there's a lot of um\nArgument or discussion in that the acrylic lake Texas have more um let's say he left his city so when you have those cold mornings and hot afternoons because of the sun you got a lot of movement in the woods so I Will say the acrylic late taxes that are available in the porch and decker\n... right now are better than they've ever been before\nSo and it's a lot easier to use 'em and you don't have so much of a dry and time issue so I think either way he's really good I'm I don't know I I I've been using

home office where I can either use my Mac laptop or even my eye pad and iPhone right yeah\nSo I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do a selfie check to see you know if the lighting is okay maybe the background to the position that a camera\nI Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen writing things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before you actually get out and start seeing ...\n... you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on ya okay and in Chicago you have sunny days and you have cloudy days right\nYes and you have a cold winter days okay I've been there and like get so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a Ringo light I don't know if you've heard of this\nAnd it's a it is a ring and uh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portrait that people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a Web cam\nIs that you have a tendency to be washed out okay with the ring light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lot of people say oh no I live better in a dark restaurant\nNot not so much K now when you're faces illuminated within the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall\nMay I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them I Want to see\nAll your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'd like to be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as a person but you know we've interviewed people before like\nThis guy you know for jobs here and you know and you look and they have this like they're the hoarders behind them and you're like ... what is that pile that too right so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have face time for example that you can hit a button and was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just record say a couple of seconds and then you don't have to worry\nAbout just taking a picture so if you can record some video of yourself for thirty\nSeconds the big thing too that a lot of people don't realize by is that you want to smile OK okay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know race or because there's a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors and I I hear a lot of the bad story but I also hear the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality come through\nHave you ever done this before\nAre only on Web in ours but not actually as a patient doctor saying\nThis is so cool I'm so excited for you um the ring lights are about sixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it\nMakes total difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point and say yes\nLittle extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because uh you seem to be a little bit washed out even if you do have this spring light and again thank you for your call [noise]\nHey speaking of let's talk about Sarah works ring leave like

somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at that so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register\nNo of course you want but and bad but as ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and and he was using square and I got gas and he said\nIn and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at a Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something in common they had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right\nOne was once and for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One didn't have anything\nYeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks\nTo appear if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order on my sister's kids came over for dinner throwing ... get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars sounds like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on twenty five per cent tip\nAfter also charging me a delivery fee okay that\nThat's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and you know door dashes and it tore us for that and also overeat because they'll say like pricing search\nOkay and so they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever maybe\nBut maybe it's like\nBeing a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods the delivery yesterday and it was probably I think it was

popped up and I'm telling ya I should have thought of this is a product\nThat if I ever wanted to create a product it satisfies the name it's private it's secure I think it's too pricey right now but let me tell you a little bit about it [noise]\nThe idea of a whole personal email server it kinda got a bad rap with Hillary Clinton and her emails and that whole fiasco\nBut the whole idea is that your email is safe it's not handled in a cloud you actually have a physical drive now setting up an email server used to mean calling in the nerds calling them again when you need to change up some settings and calling them again what had just died because it would happen\nBut there's a new product called ...\nAnd your emails no longer floating in the cloud somewhere and\nSays it's actually physically in your home the server like I mentioned the expense of five hundred bucks by the size of a book\nAnd has a hundred and twenty a gigs and storage or trade can go to five terabytes there is no fan passively clued cold rather um it has a security Kiev physical key because also the emails encrypted so it's not just five hundred bucks and there was a hundred dollar a year subscription\nFey and if you think about it this way there's other downsides and one of them primarily is that you're not going to have all the latest feature saying gee male and auto complete ten you know taboo auto it's going to fill out all the census for you but at the product that does have a niche does have a need\nAnd when the price come down and I think is probably worth like all taken a look at\nGo to

Kim\nWe're going to start with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania ... spring\n... that sounds like a nice place to live doesn't it doesn't really horrible place I live in spring grows right next to a garbage\nTown Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas [noise] and she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless countries immoral and she has her for her so even while\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to using the rising towers so she's like oh well they use all the same stuff was going to be all the same connection I mentioned rent [noise] what if it is whatever it's worse\nFor two hours I mean to call him and it's so frustrating though isn't it\nI mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right now if a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial here and I know I think I missed it by yeah you're right on the edge is that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't\nHave say a fiber optic next I mean that is now requirements like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and a fiber connection so then this way\nYou don't have to worry about what's going on so I don't care and you don't have all bars in all places that's\nWhat I'm hearing that is correct [noise] and there's no way that you want to move to the big city uh now now we're going to stay right here okay so so when you complained varieties and what did they say\n[noise] um\nThey really can't get many answer I've been I've been with anything twenty twelve okay\nBut the past month is just so slow here\nThat the Internet's almost useless [laughter] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast\nFor my Internet and then ... can't say well we also have noble and so I thought well that might be a great don't care of it but I'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same price and towers and would switch between ... hours and Comcast hotspot [noise]\nNo I don't know what I Am I I don't I don't find Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise]\nYou you know what you okay ... you know what you could possibly get and I don't know of arise and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs they may be able to get a little what's called a ... for your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself and but the thing with the ... and this is why\nI kinda went and robots Comcast is ed is Comcast\nIs using other sent to sell to increase your reception and you're in bars I don't know if I like that either um\nSo my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that low repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest me so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers that even though like varieties in and Eighteen T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often used different frequencies in technologies so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay um\nAnd they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe uh the towers and they don't have to carry that that and they can make more money\nSo the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with say you know which frequency is Comcast on the tower and how does that compare variety so that there's nothing you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different enough that one service might be better\nIn ... and Comcast sense as a cable companies some of this ban with maybe coming off the cable to now there is on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on poor gee you're talking about one gig Abad a per second speed versus on five gee you're talking about multiple ... and so\nYou know couple of solutions that she might want to try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I can try that we don't have a real real close to ... I'm afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage made very right [laughter] you know if I could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is have Comcast to turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works and\nExplain to them I don't want to sign a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or see what I'm getting and you don't let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep the current costs more to get a customer so again you might have to escalate it's a little bit up higher\nBut it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation\nAnd Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on [noise]\nAre you doing on looking or an app that I can secure Lee's son among to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car accident and rather than go through the ...

you have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly because they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the

you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it saves me getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call stay right where you are we have our money to him coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the ... do show [noise]\nMemory marriages digital\nJust leave it works and whether I Will yell dot com\nOver the years I've tried and tested every way that average people can and should back of the data on their computers I'll tell you that I drive it's simply the best climbed back upstairs there is for big reasons why\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nAnd then you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things or you have what would I have is the next year up okay and then within the next the a ha we're this where\nThings have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's bear\nSo at least illuminates maybe less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nAnd that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charles what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started thinking about OK what more can I add to that right\nYeah so ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that that's awesome idea\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when\nYou start looking at different products the smart things down this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave and ... and those are different standards\nAre well and that works with the smartest things next to the ah everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next yes that's\nSo ... that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons so once we had the hub what else can we do if that\nLaw took place yeah exciting I mean it's really cool but\nGoing after the actors on stage with\nThe holograms turning around and her don't you think that you and I would I be excellent at doing like a theatre version of

I'll take a look at the ... to ... cents and connect\nOK okay the next thing you have is about sixty bucks the lock is going to set you back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month\nAnd then it allows you to program all those codes and get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set it for twenty four hours and then if somebody does do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code and killed it automatically there's no delay\nYou can also un ...\nYeah you can set up a code it really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really make sense that you start looking at smart and stuff and order to be notified and get alerts and things like that hey Charlie thank you for your
