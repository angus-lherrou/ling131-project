great\nTo talk to my friend how are you I'm fine thanks how are you I'm very well um so your your take on this reopening of the FBI investigation background check into Kavanaugh there are some Republicans\nWho say well this is a good thing because it uh gives cover to people like flake can Collins on to actually vote for cabin on in the end\n[noise] you know this has been about I'm ... from the get go and I'm\nLike I watch most eloquent here is the treatment that this got from from Diane Feinstein said well this person asked for confidentiality [noise] um [laughter] this could have been investigated by the FBI honoring all request confidentiality from the outset if that's what they want it\nAnd um I think everything has to be judged in light of that [noise]\nBut it it would to me it seemed very obvious from the very beginning when they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the hearing screaming at him\nWe're interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the air and screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the left believes the Supreme Court just another\nA super legislature and it's not really a court it's more of a social policy making body to the left in for them it's all abortion and and various social issues and Kevin ... even though he's a Bush guy or doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\n[noise] well um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be who gets appointed came to be so important I mean there's one judge has started I'm putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement from the constitution that happened a long time ago when when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's from a number of surrounding the other amendments\nI'm quite clear that some people on the court for that were that they could make it up as they went along [noise] and so then I guess it very much matters who whose head is popping out from beneath the black great [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I've never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who\nIdentifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but\nThen so be it neither now so she she she know express something\nThat I began ... beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race\nOf Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here\nWhich is I'm In title to this I did the hard work and school and college and I deserve this was the end of that is not the case no one is titled to vote on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed the waves of did on Thursday\nDeserves to be even an judge\nA reaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race um I I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow\nHow one appears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan ... you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYear high school\nI don't know why why high school when I go back to sixth grade wise just high school the\nLimit here but it it it all reflects on your\nEar character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know useful indiscretions pass\nAnd they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well\nWe saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive and respond any of the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't have the temperament\nThat's that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know it's if he loses either way\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right a president said FBI can has free reign and that's the phrase you gay free rein a\nWell free rein to do presumably what\nThe Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check\nAnd background checks are are not about you know are not about ... I'm not criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence less occasions their background investigations\nAnd they interview witnesses lay out what they say and present it to the Senate which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president [noise] now\nThe um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on\nOn all of this so that you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying oh there and he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation\nYeah well again if if high school and college drinking is now is now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now yeah what we're going to be judged on I I don't know who want want these\nYou know these nominations I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly you didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just to\nHave it for a fan right yeah no nothing nothing stupid nothing new\nBut at all because you're you're you're him UK is all the rest of us did\nNo um [noise] I if there's anybody who um it would be willing to have every day of of his you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um\n[noise] the American bar association a supposedly it was a it was of course it was improperly reported early on uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you\nKnow highly qualified to be on the court and turns out that\nThe president of the of the NBA pick up

now one eight by by forty Laura\n[noise]\n\nTo sexual assault hotline have increased two hundred percent since ... testimony senators on both sides and even President Trump named her credible it is now the default in America that accusers must be treated seriously and respectfully now only the willfully ignorance don't know why women don't report abuse ...\nWhat is the strongest memory you\nAt that level and the campus is the last ...\n\nYears we are here's where we are in the me too era of a hyper feminism\nMen are all sexual abusers\nThere or potential [noise] they're potentially going to sexually abused you [noise]\nIf both parties are blood oh drunk [noise]\nUh and there's no [noise] I mean there is no cooperation then it's definitely the man's fault if there is no cooperation\nContemporaneous or otherwise\nThen you have to believe the woman always I mean this is on the face of the ... break a case\nLacrosse case the ... case and so many other cases over the years where people are wrongly accused and this is in in wrongly accused any kind of narrow timeframe this is thirty six years ago more contemporaneous timeframe this is thirty six years ago\nBut that was John Dickerson kind so again men are trying to prove themselves the eye care I care I care Alan Dershowitz was on CNN this morning had some very interesting insights and a Fox and friends excuse me with some very interesting inside but listen\nIf a liberal Democrat president at a point to the first Muslim American to the Supreme Court and somebody said oh yeah I remember he was a terrorist when he was Seventeen the ACLU will be all over this case no you can't presume guilt of terrorism but when the shoe was on the other foot\nWhen it's a white man being accused by the left\nOf sexual offenses all the rules are called off the rules of presumption of innocence okay the rules of due process we know is guilty 'cause he's a white man she's a woman she's a survivor that's the end of the important thing\n\nThat I I Can't agree with that that any more than if you're a white male and you're accused of something you are presumed guilty not presumed innocent you are presumed guilty\nThere has to be a a a happy in fair medium here we don't want all we don't want women to feel like they can't come forward of course they should come forward one hundred percent it's a serious serious crime sexual assault doesn't norm is damage\nTo a woman psyche and her future life\nBut at the same time you cannot do this to all men either say\nTheir\nNews talk routine for\n\n\n\nIf you're tired of paying maintenance piece of the time she can't even use you need to call resort relief now so many of you who\nNo you can't and I think it has either one of two of facts I think half the country is going back to their own history and saying\nIf I have I reached a level of affluence or importance or status or visibility in which anything I did in the past now can be used to destroy my career and the other half so as\nI Am on happy and is that unhappiness due to an event by somebody\nElse who's now pretty important and should I use that to express my on happiness and take out here\nSo it's a very polarizing atmosphere they've created I think they don't have any understanding the what the Senate does\nOn national TV given the traditions even if it isn't a criminal case but when they dismantle the protocols of due process of a they say it's just a job interview or whatever they call it that dismantling affects all of our other institutions whether it's you know kick you know a little league coach or\nSaying the teacher and in schools should be fired or your neighbor uh shouldn't have shot a gun or where your how all of those disputes when they even when they don't reach\nA level of criminal a status nevertheless their educated on the spirit of the constitution and these guys said the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual assault [noise]\nWell when we when we see the\nFew moments of honesty from the Democrats are when they really talk I'm candidly it's about the fifth vote on the corn not about whether Brent did this someone that they're\nAnd none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote in the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said he admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have\nA he never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation vote\nFor I mean [noise] yeah it is about the fifth vote but there isn't a symmetry there and that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after\nOne ... said I Believe that a wise Latina mixed better decisions on a white male they didn't go scour and say you're a racist and we're going to\nStop your they didn't go after Elena Kagan's so early college years and they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland and they try to use protocol use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote they would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions and say you know and this guy's taking us down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after\nThe person's high school a teenage years on the way they went out that's that's a progressive idea of it but noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know it's also interesting I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white or but listen to this um tower of intellect Donny Deutsch than MSNBC necklaces and\nNow for an entire generation women going forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way actually post\nCapital of the forms that as a man I was in Dallas fan\nWho was who was an ultimate display of white title met\nThe man who made his money in part by opening up you know the our NPR from selling selling snake going all the people and also um you know hanging out at strip clubs by the way and self Donny Deutsch\n... I think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that\nThey've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being the vow or do you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear adjudicate who we are that is race class not class excuse me race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's ... who's running against white Kevin daily on a person quote unquote of color and the same thing is true\nOf Chuck Schumer and the ... things through cones there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy but they seem to think that that\nRule doesn't apply to them because\nThey're liberal and they're joining this new wave but they're also doing it out of fear because they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny dory or you could always other people's very old white guy old white guy old white guy even one\nDay and Errol like they're all old white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nHave Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exempt shoe from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecture and everybody on walls where you have this huge wall around all of his ...\nAnd all these old white guys have privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch she would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV let's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities in the world that you've\nFound [laughter] I Would love that that would make me very happy very happy and he'd\nNever happens don't expect that\nUh the we have to touch on that Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in uh in California there has to be female representation on public points\nAt which point at which point I tweeted out none of the Pacific islanders the Latino is in\nA black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be on a lot of these wars on there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want to mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look will be a Jew would be the case who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and\nIndeed and percentage fashion of the population than there are so many different tribes with claims of victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're going to have you're going to see a woman say well I\nI Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino when you're a woman but you're only white therefore I have\nI have greater credibility as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on this war a war going down there and I don't know where the ultimate project Korea's but either people are going to say you know what\nYou know deserves you know set aside on the sport or we're going down there and I don't know where the ultimate project Rio's but either people would say you know what it's getting chaotic when we go to stop this go back to the melting pot\nJust look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're gonna we're going to go into something like the Balkan [noise]\nYeah well I think again it is this all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good practice identity politics but you see this event and and the entertainment industry\nWhere we have an African American hip hop or by Kanye West he he's the guy who has some guts man I don't really agree with us and I don't like his music and I I'm not here not my not my cup\nOf tea but talk about breed going out on stage on ... ... s Saturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive entertainment and wearing a make America great again hats standing on stage and this is how it went down\n\nKnow\nI Can't hear it that way with a plan that version of it but he was actually on stage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got food you got ... got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump says the laughter will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans that have been over look\nLike a lot of people in the inner cities suddenly they have leverage that may have worth and that's the kind of a revolutionary messy so west\nAnd others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people that will be patronize wide government the title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics we always got to have the after its identity politics but it's all progressive so if you're west\nIt doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison 'em and you're charged\nWith sexual assault well it doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's in most cases or gender or your race you have to have the proper raise the proper gender but you also have the ... out to have the proper ideology\nWell how do I mean one of my time but how\nHow do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and they in group same thing all the rage man how do we\nGeorgia van gundy the Iowa
