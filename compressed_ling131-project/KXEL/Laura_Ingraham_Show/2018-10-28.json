that's your God then the doctor and theology and looked up to see a statue of Jesus on the cross as of\nJesus for just one God among all the gods\nIn that man's mind though well intended he believed that you could be Buddhist and Christian you could worship whatever job you wanted or as many as you wanted\nWe have heard often in our lives and doesn't matter what you believe in as long as you believe it's them confess it sincerely and we live in a culture of the time that says all truth is relative to the individuals perception and conviction\nBut I don't believe that\nI Believe in a

especially hated he lied they searched every inch of their kingdom they even threatened neighboring kings who might hide him\nThey treated the lives that are like the number one criminal over the world they wanted the profit ... dead\n\nAfter three years of drought with God telling you lied to hide from me ab now God told ... go show yourself to a lab\nIn that context of direct\nEndanger the lives of boldly walks into the palace and issues this challenge to have to end the priests of bail that they have a contest\nOn Mount Carmel and made the best God the real God the God of power and glory\nWould win so the priest to bail go first then the gods\nOffered their off ox as a sacrifice\nFrom morning 'til noon they pray louder and louder they prayed dancing around the altar of sacrifice

sports our bodies the pursuit of beauty or long life\nWe also worship in the temple of power we make gods of success money\nAnd achievement same positions of influence and power\nOr we worship at the temple of love and then we make gods of romance even elevating family members above God and then of course\nWe make gods of ourselves\nIdleman writes that the gods at war clash for the throne of each person's heart\nThe moment we make something more important in our lives than God it becomes an idol is that our source of security is it the object of our passion and affection is it the purpose\nOf
