I I just wanted to say I'm I've been on both sides I've been in in a doctor for the position and I've been in jets Kevin a position where\nHi I just wanted to say I'm I've been on both sides I've been in in a doctor fourth position and I've been in judge Kavanaugh position where I was a tax\nOn lasted a in a doctor's office in fact and then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation\nAnd so I Would have believed her if she had come out with Kavanaugh's demeanor and said you creep you did this to me and if he had taken her demeanor and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was in high school I Would have quickly the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I want to start a match on your show right now Dianne Feinstein must resigned\nNah I appreciate it eight five five forty Laura oh let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\n[noise]\nUm I I just wanted to say I think um everyone tries to say so many people said a doctor for testimony was credible but that's because it's the polite thing to say it's a politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists I I think\nAnybody that looks at her testimony objectively which say it wasn't credible\nAnd Mr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social law and he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up\nAnd and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here\nAnd I I appreciate it a five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history is not the most difficult\nAh but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous cooperation\nWho have some type of axe to grind can't do it and same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it\nWe know people who practice emotional extortion a political extortion this is a this is like an emotional terrorism\nSo conservatives need not apply because if you ever had a beer and high school never partied too hard you can't get on where you ...\n\n\nIf you're tired of paying maintenance piece of the time she can't even use you need to call

you\n[noise] logging morning I don't know what the word ... means but I think I'm work 'cause I'm pissed this morning I Apologize your listeners going there but this is a sham it's a new low in America this level of character assassination I didn't think we would see again in my lifetime but I'm disgusted with the process this week\nUh the the fact that President Trump comes out yesterday and starts talking about it a and says look this could be your father your brother's son she's getting excoriated and the media or they're saying he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the pros on a hundred percent but you know the war on women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case\nYou know a doctor for whether you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they didn't expose it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who was putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple of years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nAnd I think a ... year exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense and everyone out on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake like our in the elevator\nYou're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense and everyone out on their heels all the time like Jeff\nFlake powering and the elevator and then you get these things are yelling at me it turns out the woman is a co executive director of of the Soros funded group as you said Center for democracy and I think it's sort of turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that uh and maybe a good lawyer the plaintiff lawyer could do that or just good good litigation attorney can do this this is kind of a\nIt's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there are inherent\nCivil rights and I totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what these senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nTheir absolute get up and absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans were they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and it it if it doesn't do anything else that should serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing office for the last hundred years it's time for Republicans to stop being a minority party and low and and grow and grow up and you don't have to grow up and become\nA you know stop playing defense is is this is the time right now\nA senator for do ah there's so much a that it's happening a which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been a ... ... only negative or because that's just one of the media are they're not going to that I mean we've had this NAFTA deal path okay or or your beyond a dose you'd have to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big of a ... a Obama ridiculed I'm going to made it meant way this magical I'm going to renegotiate all these deals well didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work\nI and and you know unless you're nothing on this huge alone milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it is part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the way it did under President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in denuclearization of North Korea this president's agenda is working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the office talking about what's working in this agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant okay\nThere's a new I tolerate that anyone comes in my family and my kids\nThey they they better be ready they better be really ready because this is I'm not intimidated by some rich kid who lives at home with his parents and in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your three square meals a day in your ear\nYou know your your activism on the side of it I just it's just I was impressed me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be ... this week and it starts right here in the United States Senate people who are supporting this\nActively encouraging and signing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from from Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people were answer for out\nOf Dr Ford or anything else they are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them and stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nDo you think we have enough Republican money bags types\nTo counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars and ... into voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nOr this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and lay on the line on them like oh Trump hates you and you had to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this tight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams ... sale\nAsked why or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's awakened the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race in Georgia is drawn thirty million dollars from um [noise] uh Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia steal that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of of the remarks uh the initial a defense to judge ... capital and gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were\nA if I felt that I was unjustly maligned\nBut then it went on and the interaction with some members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... face of all the ...\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations that presumption of innocence has been a\nTrashed in this whole process it gets not convenient for the Democrat\nI mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again calls him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just the ... the tip of the spear of what their ... activity I actually\nA Center for do in

doing it across the board and so we we've got to get the word out to voters and so folks out there you know look up Dave Brat dot com and help me out it yeah\nYeah Dave rent dot com everyone go there ah contribute to this campaign because Republicans are being outspent because we have mega billionaires led by siren George Soros is the Washington Free beacon pointed out a few days ago\nRolling out huge amounts of money for state focus donations for campaigns excuse me and\nThey know it it just ... it comes down to turn out in the mid term race it comes down to turn out in energy\nAnd Donald Trump demonstrated I think very well that it's not just you know it's not just uh how much money you spend on advertising however uh it it ... it matters that you get air time it matters that you are fighting\nFor the people against these type of fungus tactics are on the left or this these vicious intimidation campaigns the demonization of boys and men and brothers and fathers\nAnd husbands and I would stick to all those issues congressman because I think this I think this is Brett Kavanaugh issue even though you're in the house and it's all determined in the Senate I think it cuts across party lines and I think it is an awakening for Republicans this midterm election cycle your thoughts\nYeah no you're you're right on the buddy you I I Want without wandering it a path\nBut this one the millions and billions being spent and then the tactics that you mentioned my town hall there they seven hundred activists came up from the lab swearing a pastor as he gave the opening prayer at my last town hall it's all all on video people go Google it but that people just slip door walkers for spanberger\nA campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter is home alone for people show up at the door looking at my windows taking pictures walking around my house I leave a piece of ... health day that my daughter has to retrieve you know half hour later she stayed in the house it go out that God\nUh and then the young man that was busted wherever you of all of it ends up talking to spanberger within a half hour\nAnd so I you know I ... what do you conclude from that uh it it's not good out their their their you know chasing people at a restaurant\nOr no due process or in it it's\nThe leftist fighting with tactics we've just never seen before and especially on the fundraising but it's a get out there no matter where you are in this country and support does support the good conservatives are that are out there running because they need help right out there is a lot of folks\nThat are deep down in numbers I'm running a tight one and so all the help do what they are just ... you're right or we just need to stay on message if\nOne of the biggest thing Iran I was immigration and the left there's nothing that separates that the mainstream voter writes a Seventy eighty percent issue the left right and I was ... open borders\nA sanctuary city is no rule of law that they are they running as moderates but they're left of JFK by a mile and so that's the big new change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have ... real results and this Republican a majority the results versus radicalism\nIt's facts feelings it's information over intimidation results over ... over and over and over again\nYeah GDP is four point to right now it's going to be over four and a half but it on her to grow what Kennedy a shitty but you did your Kennedy did supply\nBut I Will tell you David or they don't tell you this and I tell us on my Republican friends running numbers don't make it numbers there's a reason your opponent is doing a commercial with a a with a medically challenged child\nAbout a motion of ... so you have the emotional argument is your father is your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault\nWell have been a have been you have ... are in jeopardy because of what's happening in Washington and ... and that that's right that's what you need I mean I ... the numbers are you know that's it's great but you get people out on a on a motion to\nDo with that my my opponent said don't do look at the numbers are skinny number and my response to that air go look at a hundred billion Walmart shopper who sales are through the roof and then at the kitchen table issue right everybody's life is way better off now everybody geared\nThousand bucks back in the pocket in it it's a family issue it is a kitchen table issue until they are they're they're running against the good news ah I'm I like where we are but uh\nWe we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing messaging together and like you said we've got to type stories that's where I ended up people\nIs Ryan and raising money for ... for me the money just for the a congressional campaign committee but is he ... raising money in part is getting money from them\nYeah Yup yup Paul Ryan's or helped out a ... a bunch of other outside groups are coming in to help out\nA thank goodness and so what they're doing that around the country\nAnd ah we were we can win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not just the numbers the optimism every small business that go meet with or buying a new truck or buying a new little piece of capital equipment or hiring one more person that but that's a huge deal most of where I live or just regular small businesses\nAnd they're all at a good mood so it's like you said that the key is they have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need\nEverybody out everybody not vote until your church your church your business is your sports clubs just all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nForward not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward what this was optimistic pro American pro American worker pro manufacturing\nBase and thank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a President Trump President Trump by the way I was in the rose garden ah yesterday uh oh was it yesterday or Monday started Monday during the NAFTA announcement said that\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they want border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for a different reason 'cause I have some very find people that are running in close races in may affect them and or may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually right in this political calculation is he is he right to put this also in the Republicans' until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with the problem in the budget process it we've lost our lab rich right we we let it be known nine Senate Democrats will block us into right now we don't at the beginning of the cycle or after the election our laboratory back to ... percent\nSo he's probably right on that call and we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rallying cries up his election and of mine and the people want to see it and\nA nine Senate Democrats ... uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole parties gotta come behind the president on this immigration issue because it is the issue that just\nDivides the crony elites up in the city from the average person back in my district that everybody I talked to\n... do you want a wall you want to seal the border you want to get rid of\nThe gang activity and it it it's not just immigration is tied to the opioid problem Fenton all three hundred billion lethal doses of no him across the border this year in one year\nThat's linked to human trafficking that link the gang activity down to the family mental health depression of the kids is up Seventy percent\nThat's all tied and we've been working like crazy with that on our with our share of\nThe immigration is intimately linked up all these other fundamental social problems we had a if you don't get it right or we're not going to solve these problems\nAre Dave Brat here in the lower income show go to Dave Brat dot com help them in this race he's one of the finest US Congressman than we have serving in America today he's he's with the president on all these critical issues and we need more Dave Brat and Congress and we need him to return to Congress will take a break don't go away\nBut from our world travel I'm Rudy backs up their
