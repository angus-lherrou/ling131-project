because it's one of two things\nI'm simply going to say I support Senator Durbin assertions\n... I think they're just they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things is going to pan out I mean they the stall ...\nI think it's good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans are more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they've been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's what I really believe or let's go to a JC Florida on line one Jaycee\nLaura I'm I just wanted to say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful Lindsey Graham said what he said and continues to call up a left but\nWe've grown so accustomed to our representatives not really doing their jobs and pushing back not fighting left on a consistent basis so on one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like a hero you know this should be the norm and not the exception so this is Lindsey and the others were sent to Washington to to\nThe world wedding ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame\nThat saying okay we don't do that\nThat's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think that when people tweet around things like look a man helps an old lady across the street [laughter] you know or look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps than autistic kid and they and the seven eleven\nOr the other video of helping him stock things which is nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that's humanity that's that that is what we all should be doing\nSo I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keep saying negative thing for people so that it is nice but it's kind of an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we have to know that when someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no trouble\nSadly like there's so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your job on while you have to look Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room\nPeople are voting machines walking down the halls and hands shaking him like he just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that is what he did\nBy the way the Durban let her just quickly it says no where there's a Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of these six Kevin ... FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wants some of that\nReally she thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out miss characterize what's in these FBI find\nIt's a it's each casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in this FBI report\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three Scotty\nThe uh the\nThis FBI ...\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three Scotty the\nUh the I think a lot of people I've lost an appreciation for actually our poll found through all the political saturation of all you know the back and forth\nProfoundly positive the exposure of the left or they're they're I mean they're rabid aggressive approach to New York to need need for power um it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they'll do literally anything to get and what's happened in this capital earring is literally from what I you know for I'm I'm fifty three years old and from what I can see\nThis is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness the you know that that they it's their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I mean I've got plenty of Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything they're loving it this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very odd\nYeah that was the uh that was the open to the show last night now if there's any doubt anyone's mind just how out of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos\nWhere we should have calm or they want to rebel route and intimidate instead of show results intimidation over ideas\nThat's where it is I think about it it's intimidation tactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports intimidation\nOver information\nAnd insights ... intimidate this was all ... they're the biggest bullies in town they're intolerant other of other people's views well they claim to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful they say that you're anti immigrant when all they do is talk about white privilege\nRacist and you're they're obsessed with race we won all people to be treated\nThe than the rule of law should treat all people the same doesn't matter what color of your skin is when you cross the border illegally that's the that's why the law so important doesn't give preference over one group or another shouldn't a five five forty Laura glass half full I Believe that are coming up next a former assistant FBI\nOr a staffer from New York has interesting insights on what we're about to find out or not about these reports\n[noise]\nWe've seen for\n\n\nThe ... but a real life story from trinity debt management and I had a lot\nA supplemental background investigation\nBut first of all the the original background investigation was at a public document data so why should the follow up investigation be a public document what I'm going to be very interested in St Louis how long it takes a for that information to leak out of the skiff\nThat's where they have to go to look at it and who's gonna who's gonna lab that it's going to be ridiculous but it will come out sooner or later during the\n... what a skiff is I Know what it is that my\nWell basically the skip is is a real much a soundproof or you can't hear you can Erin as you walk and they can't carry in the cell phone you you walk by watch or anything like that you can sit there and read it like a lead enclosed room so nothing gonna traits that they're considering they're read a recent report\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and um and then they can leave it for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before ... like the lake so bottom line is money and if you have to do are\nAs many it takes the delay this past the election watch\nOut like they're on a card so the the current mayor coming down on this don't you don't even get that sense there's no there's no more delays are gonna vote on this this weekend\nI think those should not be any more delays you do the best you can do\nIn the bottom line is the only thing that the ... the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to allegedly offer and only to the way of looking at a a vote\nI think this is a is going to be voted on I Believe but the end of the week [noise]\nUm [noise] the complaint is that they did not\nThe a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week [noise]\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college or law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that\nThey know that if they haven't read and how do they know what's in the supplemental\nThey they don't know what questions are asked for who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the judge has some beers with ocean yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just sent my thing that they just want to keep the pot stir it up in order to the you\nKnow continue that the alleged doubt a contrived out I look at it is but those that are opposed to the ... we have an update\nHere that Bill Bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that ah the FBI ... ignored testimonies from former classmates of cabin all these are people that went to Yale with him and are they the the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read into the story you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo it wasn't the FBI pro those people are they just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and and bottom line first of all come from Ronan a secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses to that\nThey're not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind the doing this and you have to make that cut off someplace into what is you know\nAnd what does make sense to do and none of these people make sense than anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody [noise]\nMhm well again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense Laura and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here\nUh the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out in the ... the Democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all Trump Trump bands from the bureau if it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and its credible uh\nThen you know I was going to take a black guy from the other side of that was\nI I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded\nAnd done and let's get the vote [noise]\nWell I think again in the end people want to have\nPeople have faith in our our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect sealed agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nA broad ranging ... brought us this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so ...\nAnd not reporting properly what they're all the FBI us but if you if you see the ignorance that it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better\nOr who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you said or bottom line is these some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that does anything going on that's wrong here it's because they support they have to say well I Believe that does\nThat a judge Kavanaugh was guilty you can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion but they do ...\nHere in

that gives Washington ... [noise]\nYeah their their bottom dollars that's for sure\nThey don't care who gets slime they don't care who's reputation is forever marred uh as long as they can retain um power or get power it's by any means necessary and that is a sad sad lessons for our country\nAnd I hope we have parents who are educating their kids on what really happened during these last two and three weeks eight five five\nForty Laura I'm much time we have James\nEarl right when they're thirty seconds are coming out Mark Penn uh he's going to give us a snapshot unaware the mid term election cycle is and I'm going to ask him whether the Democrats played this\nGame way too long of delay and whether they really they just overplay their hand there's overplay their hand here and extreme do they look too extreme for the American\nPeople now and how will that affect a midterm election turnout if at all eight five five forty Laura\n\n\nTalk between four to\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Ginny cell sunspot correct or she says she loves it it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age sponsor can see a definite difference in her skin since using it\n[noise] so I see that the American public is pretty sensible or as you suggest you do they say well look we saw this testimony\nWe believed Ford and we believed cat and I also and so what really makes the difference well does the FBI find cooperation are not well what we find in the polling is that sixty percent said well look there's no cooperation then\nIn fact the nomination should be confirmed and that included eighty six percent of Republicans Democrats or do you look Democrats even after there is no cooperation sixty percent of Democrats [noise] you know would oppose the nomination but you see that sort of the center\nOf the country says hey if I could see that there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no cooperation and that's certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree uh and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took\nWhite limited task after the Trump election who's helping him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\nSay faith focus her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent home of whom voted\nFor Trump sang chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said well now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support\nAmong Republican women had dropped by Nineteen point\nOh that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people\nVoting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the geo pay\nBut I think that is the the biggest but both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and victory points to the Democrats so far which is that the closet what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women\n[noise] who voted twenty points for Romney's who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think this Kavanaugh nomination never help that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominees for what might have been more conservative [noise] what would actually\nHave been the right strategic choice here\nI think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters\nTrump talk but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to win them back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and\nAll those issues that Trump has focused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six\nUs see uh LA Times poll counted twenty per ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage\nAmong married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five point\nThey had a much bigger or they had a much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as\nWell um this is this is a substantial block or the\nMarried college educated women and that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone\nWomen like things calm things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and they seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know [noise]\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof\nWomen who as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy and its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day every day that to the national question is is she\nRapists or not\nThere's a day that do but it's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states and show again the races are hiding in do you think that they perhaps Donald Trump busy data that shows that this is driving conservative the conservative voting base\nBack home of course the the Joe\n... is exactly to Donald Trump signed the one thing he is an expert in is resent specifically in this case\nWhite male resentment\nWhite male resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even more men now to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that the Democrats have gone way too far or not [noise]\nFor ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare and and the politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that\nThe Democrats were completely energize\nThey were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump\nAnd the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized\nAnd I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately uh I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading\nAnd and now I think you can see it kind of a balance among turn out here\nBecause the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again\nYou see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who now are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination\nWith the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party when it's United is pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so [noise]\nYou know it's so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nBut see that's ironic thing that I can actually see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTighten up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted forty courts for Trump you know there's no question that it's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would work she confirmed which are in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job at the end didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message\nWhen we're we're McConnell or you say has stepped up ... maybe some people think rightly maybe some people here are too harshly but as you said you stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I Would have to read or less\nIt throughout her lessons and at the Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing and be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now a Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nA five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think it people said Trump was embodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have you vote for some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote or you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in this basic principle of fairness and would as mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nAnd political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote get a get out there and vote and vote Republican don't go away\nAnd a\n\nRepublican year will be a Democrat and Republican

manufactured right to an abortion so\nThat they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting like pre announce that they would reject them and it's despicable I'm sick about\nOur side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll\nPut the nail the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the most qualified and and one one of those things I worry people find judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big\nGift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of resistance and intimidation rabble rousing and chaos and meanwhile Trump\nIs slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is if Congress this fall\nBut we did read it NAFTA he's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again it's not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than a seventh of all federal judges are Trump appointees\nUh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed that means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long past Trump's administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nAnd and some people say well the reason you guys want Trump is just because we're ...\nNo they're not just because of him is because all the other judicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes\nAnd regulations\nIt's better trade deals would say it's standing up to the left and\nFinally we have a warrior in there to\nFight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity\nAnd realize that we're in a in a serious battle to preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is that in where mccaskey and all the others are college but I'm hoping\nWith this FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the\nThe audacity to vote against him at this point\nUh David you have immerse yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian

occurring\nIn our society they they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's\nThe conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which is faith then

to\nUnderstand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves [noise]\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law and when he was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were a new competing religion but that they were perverting the religion of God and\nWhen it was Judy as was a religion of God's ... and it there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be them aside because they expected the Jews expected a military our political\nDeliver from the the forces that

and in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the same ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road blind them with light and converted him\nTo from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelists ... Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and that in the periphery of the Roman empire and establish churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest

forge testimony changed any way in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or Kevin always listening to talk to Kevin off or how many times from we're having a years\nUm but they testified under oath and so the the thing is no reason to talk to them to go out and talk to people they claim corroborate what they're saying the FBI couldn't find any [noise]\nSo I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it and here and it was probably ten minutes ago ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\nGet the impression\nThat the Democrats think they've lost because the little CNN reporter only looks a little to me\nHe was describing Jeff Flake\nJeff Flake said this was a very thorough this is this this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today actually sounded like a Republican and that presents a problem\nOkay so Here's NPR doing a report starting out railing against me and my comments productions of feminine season and\nThen they go to Frank lunch and Frank Luntz explains to them why there might be a little backlash occurring uh not just among them but among people on the rise in general and now here is the payoff NPR without they pulled it themselves and they found that exactly what I\nHad been saying has come to pass the capital hearings are back firing big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they plan to support a Republican candidate in the coming midterm election right now\nI'm so this this is happening and they only primary change your difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and lay down the left reaction to it\nI've even seen stories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will see about that but clearly there is a reaction is and and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you\nKnow even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people a day that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran the operation to destroy women who surface saying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or rape lamb or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and he got booed because the millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people are not live to Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this was their first\nAnd that means it is the worst smear campaign ever that they've seen could anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact he's been vindicated by evidence even vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life where I Lived when\nYou boil all this down I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican to vote against the guy\nAnd in fact I don't know this but I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats Senate Democrats\nAre privately behind the scenes urging recalcitrant Republicans go ahead and vote for capital ... way this is backfiring on him I\n\nDon't know that it's a wild gas and only time will tell when we get to the vote\nBut the FBI investigation at the Democrats want it appears to have provided cover\nFor both Susan Collins and Jeff

meaning is they're coming out many they're depressed or there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy in a stone faced their shell shocked there's something or other now\nWhy would that be why well did the Democrats on that committee\n\nActually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying\nI don't know how anybody could honestly\nFolks that went out and I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't remember\nSo I don't know how anybody could honestly folks that went out and I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't\nRemember where when why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although forbid did the Democrats and that many really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days was going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nominations\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that this ... nothing other than the ... this is all this has managed to all they've got if they really fought\nThe FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations and countless other interviews and written questions hasn't produced\nWell that is shocking honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but I thought this has\nBeen a scam from the get go and that they're all in on the scam and the gamble was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter detailing all of this so they walk out of ... office and they're all stone faced\nOver who will become the next McCain who will become the next conscience of the never Trump or she'll become the next conscience of whatever they never traverse think Trump doesn't have that they do have that the Republican Party needs to reclaim and here is what Ben Sasse said last night on the Senate floor\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through the time\nWe know that his disposition only unable to restrain has impulse to divide his mockery of Dr foreign last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and the not going to presume that you are listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senator Sasse you and numerous other say that President Trump mock\nDr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggest that they come knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this is who he is he can't help it\nMr Seth I'm thinking the other way around I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has a behavioral patterns of strategic ... it's called pacing and when he briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\n\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford won any set compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's ally and it's definitely going Trump said all of this and everybody's a wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the proof of the Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter you can remember countless times we're in the president's initial statement on an issue of seemed to dovetail with what the swamp things\nBut then a few days or are we go by him and the president becomes a way he is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways he's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he know right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff on Dr forge shaky uncorroborated among provable test them on to the drive by as we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the drive buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the drive buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally must be cause he said when he said about her he forced the drive by its cover what he said\nIn the process that Dr buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving the paper's given their papers on my got Trump is always uses horrible humane he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did wake counting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump\nCalling her out on everything has been play now on all media on all day yesterday\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies in Dr Ford's testimony the drive by media did not report on it on ... none of the cooperation being possible they\nDid not tell their audiences that the foreign people Ford placed in the room when her incident happened claimed they weren't\nThere nobody knew that folks other than you but people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying that people watch the mainstream media had no idea\nThat the four witnesses foreign claims where they're all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends drive\nBy it's we're not reporting and they have to drive my eyes were reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned the woman was telling the truth they had backups you hadn't cooperation and Kavanaugh\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets in on the record the drive by half to report it and for the first time in our lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way thinking for the millions of people who had never heard\nThe truth about\nDr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of ... millions would never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterize that for everybody think of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\nDetail that for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no collaboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest mediate millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protest today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous the people in these protests\nThinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's got spoiled they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democratic senators haven't told them only Trump did some other reason why they have it\n\nBut we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christian balls the foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that\nAnd the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asking about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying no corroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump has do literally insane but if Trump had in the Senate nobody would know at the Trump did say at millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report\nWe couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right drive by media wrong Democratic senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff\nThis is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing of how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nI have wondered and this is the ... stock market report sinful wealth management
