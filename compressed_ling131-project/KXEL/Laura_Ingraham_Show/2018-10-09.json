All right a five five forty Laurel talk to Steve Bannon a lot more coming up\n\nTo stalk Fifteen warning\n\nOr your word your identity could be held hostage there should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio a biology teacher making every American safer from the effect divided up as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and where does the back of your computer often\nLook you're a constitutional lawyer you're going to court you know\nThe highest levels how how much that he was going on out these uh these people are across the board it's it's outrageous you know judge Kavanaugh has never been looked at it I don't think is is cutting edge social service area of the law he's very much a show called the construction industry to state is really\nA a a a second horse harness what's what Judge Gorsuch and that's the point it doesn't matter\nWhat their what they did with judge Kavanaugh is the politics of personal destruction they want to destroy people that stay in their work and I think it was very evident uh of what they did they try to destroy him and his family and it doesn't matter to put a moderate Republican\nUp there that they will try to do this\nWell and again this is and ended up showing us that you know when it when it ... when when it's needed you can have Mitch McConnell actually stand up and fight and when the Republicans are unified\n... they can do anything I mean that would be nice if they were that unified on the wall and all these other things that the president wants to do\nKnow maybe this is the irony of this or maybe it's the first woman as your listeners though Laura up in the crowd of being at the cutting edge of this kind of anti establishment a effort I've I've no battle Mitch McConnell for many years we disagreed on on just about every topic\nBut we gotta you know he he stood tall normally Republicans cut and run the first down to the gunfire offer the social justice warriors they will work because they're afraid of their afraid of being called sister afraid of all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually ... and I think it was a seminal moment inflection point in the Republican Party now I think we've got everybody you know it's like that's just\nFall and actually shut the distance or\nThen I think it was a seminal moment and inflection point in the Republican Party and now I think we've got everybody in a fight that said nothing but great things about ... for the last three or four days of the reasons he deserves the ...\nHe really show real leadership and did not cut and run a judge kept if they've cut and run judge kept the fight for judge Kavanaugh for his confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency and I think it it it it who's everybody to really\nUnderstand that the Republican establishment and the populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts and all the you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want\nAnd that's what it's going to take this November and quite frankly I take that going forward so hopefully law schools the beginning of people say you know we've got to work together this is what happened and six to know when I step to the campaign in August\nWe'll quake fracture everything pull together and wasn't me it was ... it was many many people that killed together to bought the grass roots again that people like you with your show that brought the grassroots effort together with establishment and we won in ... that's the lesson well where's the night it\nPut our differences off to the side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the stakes are so hot look at what happened at the look what happened at the vote objects capital on the floor of the United States Senate looking they people have given their lives to this country\nThan the rule of law at the center we have that that behavior of those protesters were just unacceptable and what happened afterwards which are really kind of see the model that's coming so if you want to make sure that they liked the senators were harassed\nOr an attack in the Senate and if like Ted Cruz and his wife were basically a costume or by people at a restaurant and the chase down the ballot if that's what you want the future will be built up\nBut if it and by the way you may have to vote for somewhere and I was in their district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about President Trump going forward that's all we got to pull together\nWell we're talking about the ban in here on the ... show the ah the generic ballot has shrunk somewhat\nBut these distill the Republicans' biggest hurdle Steven these house races seems to be women voters women strongly are still supporting Democrats and some of these key races there's been a four point lead\nIn what um the the post Washington Post in uh the shower school and they pulled a Mrs districts as of August twenty four and a lot has changed since then but apparently it's about a four point advantage Democrats hold I think that's actually good news said it's only four points\nI think it's great news is really down look when when when Paul Ryan ... just keep in mind when Paul Ryan decided not to run the we're talking about sixty votes or than it was fifty I went on Sean Hannity on the hundred day to go and I was saying it's thirty five to forty now within\nThe kill zone this is very winnable this all of that she was an agency\nEven the post story to days a little dated 'cause it doesn't really talk about what happened at the Capitol I think what we're going to see as a member of President Trump won a white female voters fifty two forty eight which done Hillary Clinton won a high school educated white voters female voters sixty nine\nThirty one ... President Trump does resonate with women who who understand national security and women who are concerned that law and order a woman who are concerned about the economy\nOr jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out I I Love it looked at the trend is in that state it's trending which trending to to uh stopping this blue weight\nAnd and people have to understand if we stop the blue what\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other in a vicious way between the Clinton Wall Street hunter and these kind of social justice a basic cultural marks on the left tear each other apart and I think leaders to a massive victory of two thousand twenty that's where it such urgency\nFor people really the focus on this house districts in the in the coming in the coming three or four weeks that we really this is all about\nYou know one of the great things I Love about being a conservative Republican at all or is that people understand it's about self reliance inspect getting up and doing something this is a hundred percent\nIn our our zone right now to to turn this around I think you can look at every number the trend is that our favor\n... uh I certainly hope so see before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe I Know you have the movement is called a in Europe or maybe you've done some more akin to Italy we see some beanie there\nAre and other leaders but kind of saw Le Pen was meeting with so many yesterday the day before a into trying to again and recapture the European a\nCultural understanding that it's been so threatened by poor leadership\nMass migration at center and where do things stand and in Europe I Know it's an every country's different but where things stand now\nBut you know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a disaster you're ahead of where we are in the United states that's what great kind of came before a brags it\nAnd the two thousand six to victory Donald Trump are inextricably linked just seeing the same thing\nIn Europe right now ... basically what it is it's the same kind of Tea Party grassroots revolt\nYou know ... ... evangelical Christian revolted too soon over in Europe what you're saying is people that want their sovereignty back of their countries are tired of\nThe EU is really a global organization has tried to take their\nTheir national sovereignty and take the value of their citizenship away from that whether it's a migration economics a whole host of other issues and you're seeing leaders like Le Pen in France or the alternative ...

it was CNN a congressman Gary Monday who also I think they're trying to downplay this\nWhere they were trying to downplay the impeachment after they've seen these polls\nAnd so this Congress and it's

to that little ear cup they put on her ear for the translation of simultaneous translation they wouldn't provide her with a hyper allergenic our ear cups so she has to just\nI really think it's time for someone else well here's a story I was talking about earlier\nTrump Administration disowned hit Nikki Haley's plan for a un meeting on Iran\nDisassemble September seventeenth during the Kevin crush\nThe Trump Administration is disarming a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting\nAt the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from an may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to the to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward and contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran\nSeems like the Trump Administration was right about this one say their\nStock fifty forty\n\n\nDid you ever look at the stains and your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to your teeth\nAnd what it is really about organize all and I'm really thinking about that worth for game ...\nActions that really bring together a ... strategy of putting pressure on the shoulder and for the only focus a little pressure on fire 'cause you're really ...\nThat's a really interesting thought okay I don't know what she just said we played a shorter version of it on TV Now wishing we played the whole thing because it's funnier\nCan you can you can you using her phrase can we segment some of the James so I can listen to it again maybe I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept enough maybe I'm just a little tired last night with the big night\nNo it was a very I mean I'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night and we were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped Brett was there\nAll the justices were there everybody was there who\nYou know who who really was instrumental in helping this nomination confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody but maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the brilliant and incisive logic of costs the court to\nWell I think a lot of it has to do with changing our strategy around we got her hand you know there's a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway who now you can only say that term thrown around\n\nOkay these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategies inside baseball\nI'm a forgive me but she at least what I've heard she seems like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person she got people to go out and vote vote for her she probably a nice person I don't understand what you're saying\nNeed more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there but you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay on top of the u._s. understanding\nAs it has to be like all abortion\nAll gender fluidity\nHigher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalize drugs pot all\nAll of it has to be fully sit on the American people [noise] so like Obama she never really will leave the organizing world\nThere are very few organizers will Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if all different kinds of strategy\nYeah they they they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and oil and moan and claw at things like the Supreme Court big brass door\nThat Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did last night on the angle every time I kicked off a Trump agenda item winning agenda item every time I did that\nWe played a snippet of of the protesters clawing at the door to make a point the better things are getting in America the more than happy they are\nBut the ... I just found that to be a ...\nBy the way there are a lot of different angles that people got with their cell phone videos of the protesters clawing up the door so you can see like the the hundred and twenty pound guy\nLooks like he's wearing skinny jeans he's banging then you go you see the woman that was like this this liberal woman who's trying to pry open each of these doors if I Walk through them enough\nTimes I Know these doors probably way their their ceremonial doors they probably way I don't know four hundred pounds their giant clawing at the door is trying to open them\nThis is kind of a metaphor though isn't it for what they're they're trying to their clawing and banging at the more traditional understanding of America\n[laughter]\nShould America down this\nShutting the traditional understanding of America down to about ... and then they know they're not going to shut the Supreme Court down scores of course going to go on and heard oral arguments this morning they continue to go on\nBut it's about shutting down you your voice intimidating you so you're you're back in the corner of an elevator\nIt's about shutting down this idea of traditional families it's about shutting out the idea of understanding of American history shut it down polling statues down with ropes and the middle of the night it's all a piece of what they are and what they've become\nAnd its public schools it's private schools and colleges it's\nIndoctrination it's the mass migration of the country of people who are here legally who are not brought up to understand what makes this country so great in our in our history\nTo understand ... why this is so important to preserve our country you really do have to understand why how it was so hard to found in this country the American founding against all odds we founded this great republic\nAnd the term rent tremendous sacrifice of our framers the original uh signatories of our constitution great sacrifice they meant\nBut if you don't understand any of that then\nYou kinda just arrived here in America ... you can make money here boys is so great\nCan make money in China make money and you know Qatar and make\nMoney a lot of places and why is this place so great why is it wise is special so we can see what we saw over the weekend\nPurchases find ... that protest is is is ... welcome under our First Amendment I'm Talking about the way you protest the weather is dignified or undignified\nNow we're not seeing a lot of Rosa Parks out there today we're not seeing the classic non violent classy way of protesting this is a ... approach to protest\nTo run the senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that is ...\nThe gutter approach to protest\nTo run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that ... that there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated but what is going on is what happens yeah and then they because when you look at life ... and all that and this is what they're coming from like in our country and\nShe went to the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez school of logic apparently or\nHer on her own uh went to hers or ... I went to her own knows I Can't tell which so in other words Mazie Hirono God help you in Hawaii Mazie Hirono wants more of this\nPeople people are upset that I keep saying this but I'm going to say it again imagine if conservative activists\nCornered Kamala Harris James imagine what would happen Kamala Harris gets cornered in an elevator with conservatives pointing and screaming at her and she's she's backed up into the corner of an elevator imagine what they would say what's the life what do\nThey say it was anti women it was intimidating it was harassment\nThey would claim that all Republicans who didn't didn't out that type of\nOf ah of behavior and conduct that you were anti women and it would be a thousand percent Trump's fault it would be all do you think you'll be all Trump salt in this case why don't we hold Democrat leaders responsible for these type of protest they should be held responsible they're not condemning it\nAnd and they had their moment where they said well maybe Maxine Waters went a little too far that lasted for like five millisecond\nBut they hold Trump responsible for Charlottesville I say they are responsible for the Democrat leadership are responsible for the lefty is running the asylum in these protests\nAnd teeth and all of it\nEight five five forty Laura will take a break a lot more to get to Nikki Haley resigns at the UN ambassador Trump and Haley ah are going to be speaking of just a matter of moments will bring it July stay there\nFor what it is really about Oregon article and and really thinking about that word\nThe Laura Ingraham show ... actually ah find\nFeel\nAre you a stocker options trader looking for real training strategies that you can use immediately why my name is Scott ... hours the proper training academy and I'm On a mission to become the number one options coach in America I'm a former vice president of Goldman Sachs\nI over twenty five years of options training experience and right now I'm giving away my most famous one guy was over twenty unique outs and strategy that I use every day for free you can find this guy anywhere to claim your free options training guide we call it five five eight four four\nThey are limited they didn't win Ohio they still can't believe it they're not telling each ... each other on the back talking about their moral victory they are living David when the Rush Limbaugh show live today at eleven on these dogs ...

to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't\nGet it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy in there get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the paths and just get a

the stuff that got hooked up at the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all in favor of the allegations from high school they're going through what is your book I said what do you think they would do to that guy but he literally thought\nWell just get a new guy in there that he'll get a fair shake if it will move forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh um\nAny of the most I think of other guys who ran against Trump in the twenty teen twenty sixteen primary\nHow many of them was stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of ... knew that this was something you could not backed down from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam though and we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\n\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches CNN and MSNBC

done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in\nYou follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that it's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin other

Kevin on they are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives is not a fire the or the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is the word over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and until you folks this is crucial we don't I I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it's just as important that Trump do this as it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained to the American people what the American media has not told them\nWhen he resigned the essence of her testimony\nThat when the drive by said that he was mocking laughter malls before he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nAbout his image intimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIt takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nAnd that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and they have their for doesn't deserve to be\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history on at the child's life wailing

here on the periphery but do not tell me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nHow do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try

pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\n\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean their bodies accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels of governance never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the cabinet or a family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise]

Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks\nAnd firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee in every member of the media tried to ruin the capital\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that was in a corner law he does with no but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI'm going to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine ... boarded written a letter to die and find so I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... forge privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or she was also a storage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the U.S the and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out\nAnd they would never get as far as ... as it got Perry was\nClearly\nIllustrator jihad no evidence no cooperation no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought I Would go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise]\nIt won't work nominate we can't
