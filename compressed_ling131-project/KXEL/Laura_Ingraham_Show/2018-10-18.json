of these jobs\nI think you hit the nail on the head we need people to develop skills in this country the trade how many times you read articles that the that we don't have enough tradesmen\nAnd what can you say tradesmen any more people who do trade [laughter]\nWe don't have enough of skilled uh labor's hand on hands on labor as we need that and that's where people from all walks of life all walks of life can learn a skill in your you can learn a skill after you left your your current career\nAnd work I'm not talking about being up on a roof and roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy\nI when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more and I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty ... let's go to Evie in Florida heavy\n[noise]\nHi Laura I again I think you're on the Spanish American states that Jewish or the border but at the you know an American citizen here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do well the border\nAn American citizen here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the voter has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are getting better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has that extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns or criminal element of gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population\nWho are only coming into the United states to hook up again contact we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets is like no one else how many have you saw the frightening frightening display last night on the anger mango it was called meet the chairman remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's going to happen\nTo the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee if the Democrats have their way by five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\nI Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the ... for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nUh being able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make if that they need to put up a barricade or anything or whatever\nAnd with the uh that are already having a priority on any old studying at the open up your could wind up with a lot of our own study which would be helping the American and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall dollar\nA than other interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go I\nUsed to be a actually a\n\n\nThe ... is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nJoining us now Michael ... of course former Trump campaign advisor Republican political strategist he's involved in some of the key races\nIn New York he also has a great a podcast called still standing radio dot com to just go there still standing radio dot com\nThey can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in this midterm cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation and embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country find now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I thought I'd Chris chrome or a prime time last night stick or job as a warrior oh or your for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his president as parents\nCame here legally and he and doors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know if you're on CNN often as well but I Will be the model\nHe I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats arms certain team gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the time because I'm so proud of him and your um but uh the ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their ...\nAnd pay for it I think that again people who work hard for a living\nTrying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to the president's leadership and then on the other side they see chaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been the case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders if it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up and the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\n[laughter] to learn the now with ... and coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met last just\nBack during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country\nAnd and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump that ad backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd you saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam anymore we Lindsey Graham was a hero\nOf German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength and the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they started to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work\nYou know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumps the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nNow you're listening to healthy radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been down in the last few years on immigration shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same that's a million people a year and a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain the same that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration\nTwenty nine percent want it decreased okay\nTwenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and now those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration as it doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a different school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo in a lot of people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area and a ... and ... year a year or so we've seen truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven on their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen\nA chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of our whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them in paying them cash on he just got a found guilty to the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell ya in\nWestern New York and buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs me these jobs and and they they know who's taking the jobs they know what illegal immigration is all about\nAnd the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre ... immigration as to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're conflate is illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration and and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if it got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nAnd the problem she sees as its surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now ... those etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] again I say this repeatedly ... it's you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and ... was one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country\nReagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but look the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets in the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh\nA and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings the uh the people running down the uh the always based out of the United states Capitol screaming at senators\nBut the people trapping senators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed of people trying to literally ... with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building if life that\nThey're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today\nThat they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measuring well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call is deplorable right the people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like\nIllegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion in Donald Trump someone base for a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks tend to think well I got my guy yeah I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a skip the burn the birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and that this time around they better do it because they think

reason [noise] so it's much easier for me to do this and it was when I was campaigning\nWhen I said this will happen\nThis is a much easier situation [noise]\n\nEight five five forty Laura we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them as Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat left the Susan Wild\nAnd has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as a person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist within the two thousand\nAh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nOr first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every quarter of this district which is now a new district that's when the seventh district has everything from the urban corps of Allentown ... eastern to the\nCause of farming communities in the northern tier worked district what we call this late though\nA region now or what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our presents been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people are going to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a ... in Congress\n[noise] what what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what a traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nI think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just the radical a resistance we're seeing from the less\nA rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nOr we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive of that\nI'm so immigration up here and uh we high value in seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she is part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because of the me too movement the women's march and so forth a so they would\nThey try to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\n[laughter] well that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are lap now she's trying to move to the center but a result speak\nFor themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and bureaucracy you\nKnow for impeaching the president teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she wants to say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nOh Marty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American people\nIt's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks\nAnd smashing car windows and and I'm In raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a a safe prosperous nation or security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nI think it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up and mobs uh we uh we announced a campaign uh our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which in my opinion I was\nBorn and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is is is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd did it funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty notes Dane a\n\n\nFollowing is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nIt's already happening federal services to illegal immigrants soaring across the United states\nBecause of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating rights to this er rights that birthright citizenship\nAll of its ate it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country or the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans\nAnd now if it Barbara Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nShe loses I saw someone on TV say I guess it was certainly hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the ah African Americans and Latinos and\nPoll after poll will tell us that\nImmigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has so I'll give you that a stat just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity and he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from\nTurkey wearing Saudi counseling a Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nAh is ah was murdered and apparently it's on Donald Trump's falls Dr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story midterm voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're now it affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me for the ship the local community and and you were right when you have a party that is that on by by them and ah ah you know those old the guards that it looks like they are often from inside when I I think actually this um\nYou know story about uh the reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on the election if we are not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that is that when you know many people actually don't understand you know ... between the states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd try to point out that the Trump is ah you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the good as it goes in and also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to throw him in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East so uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the south is because he loves loves to dictate sodas all for personal gain because this is nonsense [noise] he's doing this because the Saudi Government the government Saudi Government is doing a good work that helps to the states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those but if you spread all over the states and why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um going prince and the Saudi Government is doing\nThe hunting and many fronts their number one is\nThey ought to hunting by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThe fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they are hoping denied states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east they're hitting big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how an on Trump is putting those on\nBy living the oil prices and then on all the stuff also the current administration look on leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever being imagine before and Donald Trump is about to announce that the a video very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's in Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the gun on\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons I Know and then all of those\nHesitant not states not that dictatorship and ...\nPlus adding to all of that we believe in this country that everybody's innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue\nAs when we have to follow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the United states but stripping my wishes of that and my ... in my home rule which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much over the race about this\nYou have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark in America and I'm In the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about this thousands and thousands of people\nMany of them this is an adult men for young a military age men who are have joined this caravan an or being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against that total lawlessness\nA die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats\nRachel and Americans have to stand against that total all it's not a die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the mid term\nWhen there's a crash and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas which is why do you always go to this year's men's and all the end of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing\nBut when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democratic vote for Donald Trump in\nA historical way and then right after that they start talking about the current events marching to the world that have denied state and what they're trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVote jump into the vote a boost and try to both would have been so this is a very well organized by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that everything is of the night you pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanic vote in Fort Drum in a historical way and then all of a sudden we have an ... you know a problem on the on the all that and then we have to figure this out and Donald Trump's days we're not going to let that happen\nAnd I think Hispanic votes watery and Americans\nCan see through this because I trust that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll give you that you have you're not going to be received by the uh the Biddy filthy works of blessed and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in or been in countries that now we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy get Donald Trump out there on this immigration issue and
