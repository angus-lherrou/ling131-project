my view but I'm not an expert on you know\nTracing bombed I I don't know I'm not a profile or of these situations that's why we're going to speak to profile ers who will tell us what this seems like people who know what bombs or when they're designed to go off look like and what they must contain\nBut at the the the list of targets are all Democrats than all outspoken critics of President Trump [noise] eight five five forty Laura we'll talk to the high camp challenger in North Dakota coming up\n\nUsed to be the forties K. I. C. uh\n\n\n\nDoes your dog it scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro order in Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nI'm along comes to Brett Kavanaugh opportunity\nTo demonstrate in a substantive way that you stand with North Dakota and with President Trump when he's right for North Dakota and of course she not only did she bought against the confirmation of of a great judge who's by the way very good for North Dakota\nOr many of his his opinions and dissent a defense became of course the majority opinion and the Supreme Court over things like EPA overreach and and in many areas ... land water air a just a brilliant judge for for North Dakota when he's on the DC circuit [noise]\nAnd so she has this opportunity to to prove or brand and she blows it by voting against him and her whole brand what right out the window and then\nWe're campus is like ... ... if she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota code a mindset in the the spirit of North Dakota which is one of a hearty courageous\nA mile still still has that frontier feeling or the the ... not a very populous a state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet ideal just wasn't fair and I think most people just want that and I and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw\nThat broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and and I think the comparison was already resonating which which North Dakota and she just pulled up with the cabinet I think because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed\nBut I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota never showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for\nA for opposing capital but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty six sixty four percent favoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him\nAnd believed that prevention port then she didn't believe him but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor you know it just it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the bail removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota law that the independent spirit that they ...\nThey frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be\nAnd now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been my own they've been exposed during the Trump era\nMy media have had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias\nAnd it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide frenzy and fury and upset and and the left always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but people have a lot of theories there um and\nI and the left just they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than\nA one lesson that you you know assuming un what's it looks like you're going to um congressmen in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride in last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and I you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the the thing I Would share\nIs let's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states at places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up\nOkay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but\nI I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what ... what a gimmick but cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find the federal government is far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressmen finally or most of the time by your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of his leads before we create something different than than the reality that it that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior and what contribution that any we make to this this discourse that's going on this lack of civility in a without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nNow it's a great way and I'm putting it um and we really wish you the very best in this\nElection coming up on November sex Kevin Cramer I think it'd be the next senator and the great

actually are\nIn\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nA victim actually the device or something like the ...\nThe FedEx bombs um that took place not too long ago I'm\nSo those those are the turn of the things that we're looking at I'm In my office here as a some indicators of there was this a sociable device or non functional device that the X ray coming out at least of one of the delays I Can't speak to all of them but at least one of them you know you'll get non functional devices here just to instill fear in people\nWell it seems again that we have a very odd and yet obvious kind of list of people from a political standpoint all of them\nAre are critics of the president or all of them outspoken critics of the president of course you have President Obama and so forth but does that tell us anything the kind of obvious nature of this last\n[laughter] yeah I I mean I guess it speaks to uh some some motives behind why they're doing it I mean\nIt's it's detracted from any other news is on the on the TV right now this is a great view of everybody now so I don't know what political motives are trying to establish here what they're trying to ideologies are trying to push for it but the bottom line is there's\nA clear cut a destruction of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about how this individual would be track what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to establish the person did it or not to give away all the investigative techniques but I mean the way to break up front you'd be looking at a fingerprint\nAnalysis from a tape of device or um you know the other other a ... that you can use to to get um DNA evidence off of off of the device if if in fact it was left I mean you're never gonna have a completely sterile\nUm uh item there a specially since this wasn't render safe by a I'm a bomb squad um there's lots of entry a value to this um which they should be able to ascertain a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a uh they've had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nThat's all well ... yeah it is odd and you would think someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person you know who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean\nAre there has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who you know where they picked it up where they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate calm another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something and\nAnd and you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb like this through the\nPostal service because it's too easily detected us or anything to that\n[laughter] well I mean if you look or you know historical data they uh bombs have been used you know through the mail um\nEspecially when you have like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what you did it or do the Unabomber stuff I mean you can use the the post office or you use other various means\nThe courier service FedEx or whatever but I think in the day you're not going to use what they used in the last few days but you're going to use something that's not detectable\nAt this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we are where the the devices actually went off um those were intended to all these ah these are intended to be found in my opinion\nThey were meant to instill fear in people that's the bottom line or a ... and then again that is just my opinion\nUh Brian Morris uh Ryan we appreciate your insight here and we'll bring you the latest as a press conferences will be taking place throughout the day on this issue with these\nAh know that there are terrorists are ... they're not attacks and that they they didn't\nAchieve their go if they didn't achieve a goal of violence however they're terrorists and that they do terrorize people\nAnd they're meant to intimidate and dominate the news ah and get attention a and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what one town a with a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign\nOr is heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santas and Andrew Gillum on now is tightening Gillum had opened up a sizeable lead over on the Santa Congress then so that all important governorship\nIn the sunshine state and now it's you know was about six points and Andrew Gillum is now having to explain themselves are given the fact that he\nLied on TV about accepting gifts or from a lobbyist well it turns out that the land developer that he believed wasn't land developer turns out it was a a FBI had been surveilling him\nAnd it looks like he had walked right into the trap and I guess I thought he could get away with lying about it I don't\n... to me this whole thing is very strange with Guillen claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits are from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so

credible fear they give a few talking points that are already given to them on the way by immigration activists and then they get waved into the country they get a driven to a bus depot they get a bus

deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then\nThey have sanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked\nUp by ice and deported\nWe're

some of them criminals and the lion share or not but they are here\nAnd they're not going anywhere so the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border disappointed by it I mean you could see the art and it's just easier at this point so we don't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a great\nPiece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday and the reason for this is that most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work\nIn the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector of the same urban areas where illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlapping competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skilled black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers'\nWages are under caught by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fake Social Security numbers and African\nAmericans are in other poor Americans are\nLeft to deal with us it's wildly unfair uh Bob in Florida on line four\nAnd I will tell you this ah ... is the only choice for Florida or we're gonna play the sound from a last night's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum\nCompletely and played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and\nThose who seek political favors are political consideration which that should it ended up itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming race of course for any question about his ethics so we'll play the race\nCard or a soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome\nTo or do you bring it up is Andrew Gillum gets elected up without a leash Florida with but she'll that's that's just the first point but\nDon't get excited about all these people are going to be down there at the border walking and people are taking them into is all\nBut if all those people are ... states and they want to be

... for us [noise]\nWell some excellent points Mao carrying the Honduran flag other blue flags that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flags\nOn the Democrats know this has trouble uh ... why haven't authority has given us more information about what's in these packages that's a good question people are asking that Lou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or were actual bombs\nThey were clearly what the timing in in the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talking about election meddling\nI mean a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempted terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserve information's probably faster than we are getting it but I think they don't want to copy cats and so forth so I understand that as well\nOh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma Theresa welcome [noise]\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly ask how much of your personal time in your personal many do you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man I have ideas it's not very much\nIt's just the soundbite for them and they really have no care for those that are around them they don't have a charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again if you if people are willing to sponsor individuals\nWho apply for legal of entry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit financially accountable for them and also civil reliable\nIf they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up\nI mean we know they enforce their their perimeter around their house with alarms and fences and gates and and servants [laughter] I mean these people have more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair\nI don't know how many people John Kades that has taken into his own uh his own you know governor's mansion and Im sure you

uh what they're about which is a lack of any message completely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold him accountable ah I think the Kavanaugh hearings for who's yours would have been part\nThe point where our race changed and many others I think enough was enough for him they related back to my race and many others that I saw something Fox dead on across the board the negative advertising that just swamped you on the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone on in the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or grow our prosperity earn forced the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to personal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade\nHe won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in
