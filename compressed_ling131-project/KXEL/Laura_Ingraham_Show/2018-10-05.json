strategies that you can use immediately why my name is Scott Bowers seeing your proper training academy and I'm On a mission to become the number one options coach in America I'm a former vice president of Goldman Sachs I over twenty five years of options\nSenate numbers or congressional members that means which I didn't even know what that meant until two days even know what I meant and publish their home address and small they're vitals their cell number and everything\nAh so that was done they find out who did that and then a anyone\nWho decide to serve born\nPerjury getting people to change statements under pressure or even a other types of you know illegal activity are leaking information from the Senate to a reporter confidential information\nOr it looks like that happened but what how do we prevent this from happening again being in a defensive crouch or actually saying no no no no no we're actually going to tell everyone to preserve the records here [noise] any reaction\nLaura I'm I'm a I keep thinking about the uh I guess it's an old song right if they if you let them do a treat yourself to blame 'em ... by my to my mind\nWhat's happened here in Port and only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh my my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the into roar um effect that it creates for conservatives and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nA toe the line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you that if you try to crash your party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that\nIs to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that are out to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nWell and I I really mean that is not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president in a campaign but coming from a lawyer and a long time to serve like myself I really believe Trump ... the Republicans\nHow to fight and thinking of simple formulation but\nHer longtime Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all like in an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination\nIt well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes to the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means there's going to be accessed from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYeah [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to take it up because\nI I've seen you say this what are you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these Olin ski I direct action tactics and they say you know there's some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants to sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein she's a liberal but she was fairly well respected until I think the last\nYou know a couple of years where she's been especially the last year where she's really been pushed left I mean she because of course their primary challenge and the and the California has become more and more left to go on more or less and less left the country almost [noise]\nAnd yeah well she is now ... now a new person\nYou probably know this better than I Do but didn't California instituted some system\nHold on we just have breaking news Lisa Murkowski is voting no\nThe Kavanaugh cloture vote so that means you know for the confirmation so that's one person or the Republicans have already lost\nA and Collins could be a yes but Murkowski is a no I'm flake is a yes on the cloture vote a so that's a I don't know anything you want to say about that Andy before we\nGo forward as you I think pointed out the cloture vote just means we're going forward I'm ... and this is not over until it's over I mean I Know people\nThought that finally we had this buttoned up yesterday a business and there's been so many twists and turns to this and that and the other side is so rabbit about it this is not over until it's over\nAmy Coney Barrett Raymond a royal has said you better get the private jet and childcare\nReady for her [laughter] frame and keep saying that Andy\nThat's nine line there they just I mean there are some trials care in the long way flying out of Indiana are you going to need it yeah yeah Notre Dame right like they don't\nNeed to double time childcare right she's like I said my mom at six she's got even more than that I think\nI've got seven no amazingly by the way\nBut you know then ... will be back in back on right\nNow the I'm going to ask an unpleasant question what is this nomination goes down this weekend what would you advise the White House what should be the next step here a blitzkrieg very quick nomination of someone else or should they or someone suggested doubled down on ... and ride it all the way to the midterms\nRight I I I Would have to ask I'm\nSorry I'm again I'm Sorry and you hold that thought Joe Manchin just voted yes for cloture then I think Joe mansion he sees his Senate career is over unless he votes yes go ahead sorry go ahead and to\nYou know I Would just have to ask the smart political people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not been I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say you know if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a a majority\nIn the Senate or then we're going to nominate cat and a cabin all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the politics of it well enough\nLet us ... giving you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking you're going to say anything is a legal yeah\nAll the politics of it well enough to let\n... given you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking you're going to say anything is a legal ... that you know he's a legal eagle he's always law you know constitutional law but\nYou you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want to do and actually be a good one handy because that's exactly it just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced the Obamacare is a law passed\nIn twenty twelve Romney kind of just drop dead after he did a soap box the thing on the at the hardware stores like one of ... ... they just drive up to take it out across the country and said it's going to destroy your health care\nAnd that would have been a great issue for ... but this is a this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah walk her to go from the Clint Eastwood in say a man's gotta no limitation [noise] um I don't know that I'm the political guy\nThat's all right the mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it's like Murkowski\nIsn't no let's just say about mccaskey\nWhy the whole family dynasty if senators has got the ... the idea that just because your father or your husband or your brother was a ... suddenly you're ... you should be in the Senate I never liked this whole dynastic approach to\nIt you know to the Senate and the house of representatives I I I remember her father I mean and then she's like she becomes a big liberal so I don't get\nThat at all I never I never understood that but now I probably the indigenous people in Alaska are therefore Murkowski because she does throws a lot of money they're way so they're they're all there for this\nOr any McCarthy thank you so much for having on TV I'm very thin and you're one of my favorite favorite go to gas and thinkers on all these issues will take a break\nA five five forty Laura boy were biting our nails hair the cloture vote it ain't over

Anthony Lewis and ginger Howard she's Republican National committee woman\nOf Georgia so we get a nice sampling of ladies from across the fruit at play thank you all for being your Cathy I'm gonna start with you your reaction to this what are you hearing and is this turning women off watching this play out\n[laughter] perimeter very engaged conservative women are very engaged women are outraged by this whole notion that believe lemon and a woman can accuse any man of their sexual assault and that limited to the police the guard lists of whether there's any ... um crab already evidence et cetera\nSo the women that I keep hearing from my end by my Facebook page and it's full of women saying can cabin\nAnd certainly sensitivity toward women that have been victims is at first I thought that this has just gotten to be on the plate\nPlate of being absurd and ridiculous\n... a middle of the I Wonder are you hearing the same thing in ah in West Virginia the from from conservative women there are some polls I've seen where the engagement among women and I'll share this with you uh this is a ... a poll released yesterday eighty three\nAnd among women and I'll share this with you a ... a poll released yesterday\nEighty three percent of Republican women claim the midterms ... the term elections are very important that is a twelve percent increase of the same poll conducted in July so they're up a ... Seventy nine percent of a democratic women are saying that it's very important so the Republican women seem to have an edge here what are you hearing military\nI'm hearing a lot from our men and women as well and the women haired our state and there's also have been a couple of polls down here just recently\nThat there was one that said there was sixty four percent of West Virginians that want Kavanaugh confirmed and then there's another one that says there's fifty three percent\nKevin ... farm so overwhelmingly for cap and all\nAnd I've heard people say that the party of JFK has turned into Marlboro and that's exactly what's happened people are really livid over this and this is really about the Democrats trying to uh go back to the twenty sixteen election and try to cancel the election of Donald Trump and it's about roe versus Wade as well\nWhere military you also have Joe Manchin as your senator in West Virginia or what do you make of his coming out and voting for cloture which indicates but doesn't always mean that uh he might support the Kavanaugh's nomination\nWell let me just sum up senator Manchin like this if you like to play football you see somebody that that makes a taco well Joe Manchin doesn't have enough leadership that are left courage to make the taco Joe Manchin towels on after ...\nMinutes just exactly the way he's doing this he string and everybody along\nOkay well we'll see how he votes but this is um do you ginger how would I Want to go to you you're the Republican National committee woman from Georgia\nI'm due to our women all seeing this as we heard Amy Schumer tried to frame this as we've heard so many Democratic senators or try to frame this as a vote for Kavanaugh is a vote against women vote against women who suffered some kind of abuse is that what your people are telling you\nQuite the opposite my people and not just melody shaded not just women that men to that name like when I have had more women come up today and say I\nWas in the Carter that baby toward the other day and the checkout lady with so upset about it when they are saying that this is my concern is that we played the politics of gender and women against men and all in the ... and I'm a woman and I\nAnd I it's been a front can aid that we did it it just makes me very angry that they are trying to play this game and the women that I'm Talking to the right through it\nYeah they probably about forty lore is the number I'm a ... and you know ginger it's not only women\nI think you know learn I just talked so often about those ... men and women watching this I was ... I live in New Orleans and I was in New Orleans the other day and they have the TV on at a lunch spot I go to and this is not you know hardly a democratic or Republican\nSpot it's a New Orleans what everybody's there and the conversation I overheard for mothers aunts sisters about ... and in many of them said look I I I don't I was against this guy's nomination but after watching the way he was treated\nI feel my gosh this could be my husband my son my my my nephew\nThey see they now it seems a dental finding personalized the um attacks\nOn on Kavanaugh and the ... the immorality of empty attacks that are just pounded in with no evidence Jody Smith give me your reaction to this year the Indiana State director for the Susan B. Anthony List what are you seeing\nAll week I can just to absolutely agree with what everyone else is that wave knocked over four hundred thousand doors in Indiana and overwhelmingly we have support here for a judge Kavanaugh\nI think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the\nUh the adage of thing innocent before proven\nThat you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged in America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution and that means that you are innocent until proven guilty or not the opposite way\nAnd that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and it's changed their mind\nYou know you you see a lot of that and and I think um the\n... ... again I think the American people out there who are here beyond ideology beyond anything they're fair minded people and had these allegations handout had a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but\nThe unrelenting assault on this guy in the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the you're the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be me tomorrow we're going to be right back copy very quickly just want to ask you this the polls are tightening of between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you were there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this to the polls for ...\nWell I Hope so I mean it's all of that turnout is those who are concerned about having on his part I mean you got to get out there and the turnout matter I think family can land so they all have to pull together\nOr we will leave with their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break them we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty ... the ... from show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news show\nThey\n\nWeigh three hundred and twenty nine pounds I was a heart attack we map it I got four hundred it makes me not so hungry I started noticing more energy they're noticed what do you were starting to see when we come off\nI myself am the mother of two children my daughter is Fifteen\nAnd I wonder is means so that you're saying you're worried about your daughter will not be able to what\nI worry that my daughter is getting a message from Congress said her experiences that her safety is not important\nBut is it about abortion so your your daughter or not feeling it and I'm also worried that my daughter not have the right to control her okay okay I just I just want to know what we're talking about things that I'm worried about\nYour reaction to the Jodi Smith the of the Susan B. Anthony Lewis the Indians the director\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of funds\nAnd I would be I'm very concerned about ah my daughter or son I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards\nUm towards Christine Christine but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and an Indiana votes have consequences\nYou know we have a very tight Senate race here as well and when people choose\nTo initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then every five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that\nAnd one of the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is mothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position\nYou know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family [noise] so it's really it's a fascinating to me that the women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and and upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about um women it really is as much about a judge cap and not having the right to um [noise] has his innocence presumed to be full and they've proven guilty so that's\nWhy I Love Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel ... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about Brecht coming on the same way the president's ... up until we can go to knew he was\nBut watching this play out watching that dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt\nAnd something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport and a man's reputation his family be damned we're going to take this combination down becomes the marching orders no matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down the political opponents at any cost with no evidence and shame destroyed his reputation for all the time\nBut in public and even force of of of a woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think is is\nThe Americans will get that and go man this concerns me\nJunior I Want to ask you um you you have the big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points\nDo you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that Governor ...\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearing is going to really play into that because it's making when I\nWas really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman but by and count is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I had thing just in the last week or so across the snake people are more motivated than ever now to get out\nGet out and vote and not only that but volunteer that I was at camp campaign the other day people were coming in to get ... times and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and\nHow we see this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist play and dirty and people don't want to see this they really are discouraged\nNo I I you know as I look out and watch this it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the\nElection where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs and confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think is what propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he called the silent majority\nI'm my sense is it just working Americans\nAnd Americans are not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working they privately have their views about politics if they spread over the dinner table or to their families and occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd ... today in Washington I have to tell you I've seen friendship shattered people simply you don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent things were once was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smashing destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans but particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the street\nBut moms wives working women I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia of your thoughts on we're we might be headed here in these midterms\n[noise] I think that uh due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote\nFor Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and do the right way to for cable because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them at all fifty five went for Trump in the election\nSo that may twenty sixteen so that means that we had had Democrat votes as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also our work or to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that the everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so [laughter] and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for military we now we need you in December so hang it may be my\nLast breath I'm so busy [laughter]\nWell you keep going great to talk to you junior high our last word do you\nYou're you're the you're in Georgia in the Republican Party in Georgia or given this enthusiasm wishing given the cabin I'll Fight and the and the way it's being processed by voters what impact will it happen in the midterms\nI ... I think ... more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about net terms because a lot of people don't get excited about the terms I think we're going to see it where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the way it's going to con people are\nSick and tired of the in the late ... around and they are going to stand up for their freedom so we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... not just going to be a way it's going to be a thing on it and people are going to a shot shock and awe as what I predict ...\nA Judy Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans were really bad at telling their story I always critique them for this they they can't tell a story to save their life\nIn this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how will this play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in as they project themselves on the cabin on his family and what they've been through\n[noise] while I agree with what the other gal says that in
