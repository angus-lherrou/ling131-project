I Would never put Pat Buchanan offer anyone except the president and I know he understands that have\nBeen put off by presidents before [laughter]\nAlright an\nInterview I guess he's been talking to the king of Saudi Arabia\nYeah I mean we have to get into this kind of show the odd situation I I again he walks into a a\nA its consulate in Turkey and he doesn't come out [laughter] okay so looks like something happen got chopped up or something I we we don't know what happened but of course he um he ... he wrote a column in Saudi on Arab newspaper that was canceled\nYou know the guys you know marriage was collapsing at one point and you know he now he's he's a Muslim is even though in New York Times today said look the guys in Islam asked\nBut also has been a path royal service now doesn't mean you should be obviously shouldn't be killed but there are people out there seem to want us to go to war over a person you know like the person being killed their snuffed out in someone else's conflict I mean how is\nHow does that make any sense that\nWell the this is this is a classic case of the question of morality versus state interest a ... is I mean it from everything we know could show that you went in there they brought in a forensic experts from Saudi Arabia where the bones saw\nAnd he didn't come out in your head Fifteen guys going onto planes and come out the same day and the Turks have a lot of tapes and videos claim and we've got some information that the prince of Saudi Arabia was trying to lure him back\nTo Saudi Arabia for some but not for some purpose so but the key thing here today is you've got the prince of Saudi Arabia crown prince and the king put the credibility of Saudi Arabia on the line that they did not do this and so you've got to America's checking it out\nAt the same time as this looks like a real atrocity in a moral atrocity at the same time they're very serious state interests and us relations with Saudi Arabia\nSo you've got to balance those things out you know I remember you know Richard Nixon and we're over there and try to toast and Mao tse dong at the same time they're going through the massacres of the great ... and cultural revolution\nBecause we needed to deal with the Chinese against the Russians and the Cold War it's a real conflict here between morality and state interest and it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out but it's undeniable that Donald Trump believes he is acting in the best interest cold national interest of the United states\nMarco Rubio a someone who\nNow it's much more of a neo conservatives of ... Russia ah on occasion with other Republican vilify him it just\nYou know I think acts like Russia's in sometimes be a bigger threat than it is even though he's been fantastic actually lately on China Rubio's been great this is what he said about Saudi Arabia yesterday\nWe've already asked for a magnets the investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision would be sanctioned beyond that there are other options that we can take I said that's something that needs to be thought through carefully but it needs to be very strong and meaningful can't be symbolic they can't just be words that\nI Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent [noise] uh you can't just brush this well if if the investigation points to the crown prince and the crown prince\nI don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia persona non grata and impose sanctions on him personally\nSay you can't come to the United states and seizes bank accounts or something like that she got a real conundrum here so I think we're going to happen\nIs they have the Saudis are now working with the Turks and the Turks a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest in not having a breach between Saudi Arabia and the United states so gamble or you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral decision you got attacked which is this is an outrage it can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions at least against individuals someone suggested it to the solution is going to be the inevitable road agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\nNow and they wanted to give the crown prince ability right I\nMean this is ... and ... ... exactly at our way again you know when I was running against are considering running against George W.

[laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny but Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before he took off for Florida let's listen to\n\nA ... no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least\nInteresting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting far right now the progressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did have video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it because Democrats keeps saying free health care free this free everything and they're not saying this well\nQuadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nA Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict

being carried out by this group of thugs and that's what ... is there not be a body meant of anti fish is one of\n'em I'm Sorry they're not the way they are they are the body metal fascism in America in defense of the a frontline officers of the Portland be they're under orders but I've railed against the upper echelon of these police agencies\nSoftness with which they're handling at the element of his shows up they show up prepared for battle they're not counter demonstrators they are not counter protesters they are in a search and see group an anarchist group and a police state to be more sort of early on to keep the peace\nDefend like to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on once the crap hits the fan so to speak but then it's too late so\nI think it's different strategy of more of a sort of strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states is necessary because we are at the states now and I I've been seeing this for two or three months using the term political violence of people in the ... and they laughed and said it was hyperbole no it's not no it's on\nAnd as a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago and it and it's a flip did the same damn thing they showed up prepared for battle they start fights they like conflict but like I said a the police are there to\nKeep the peace not let this stuff happened not been but don't break those or feel strategies\nAnd until they make it clear with a answer for that's antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protests because this is not protest I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentator is I'm not talking about you but there are commentators are on the right who continued to refer to\nAnswer the phone and some of this other political violence is when they're shutting down uh an intimidating people in a restaurant they keep calling a protest it's not protest\nIs insurgency answer for calls for the\nKilling of police officers they call for the don't fall of the United states lawfully in to the government\nAnd I know anyone who cause that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's intimidation uh it's\nIt's a type of of political\nExtortion too when they do it to the senators and and the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why this even allowed in the halls of the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to to get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them\nIn the in the halls of the uh the capital that should be allowed\nRight and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write you know senators to another congressman congresswoman too you know keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to a private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot for group or in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to\nThat we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does that look like and I could tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view turning the other cheek\nTaking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness and like you said Laurie you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to intimidate an insight fear in people to get them to alter their their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling as\nPolitical violence it's gone on for too long it's gone too far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is getting I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the\nThe anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and I also know that what they learned though the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those soft measures just lead to more people getting hurt more people getting killed more property damage\nAnd they we I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or in law\nWhich I agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment share park at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border or so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Donna Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and others\nResistance isn't that about mob about people who do not want they health care 'cause normally about women who want to listen to when they feel that it's time to talk about their promise Tesla so there is not about mob\nYou're running and maybe it would be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV or talking about is talking about impeaching Brett Kavanaugh\nSo there is not about mob that you're running it maybe the food would be about but when we listen for the Democrats were coming on TV or talking about is we're talking about increasing Brett Kavanaugh [laughter] talking about increasing Donald Trump I and the resistance is taking the feel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nI eerie action to that\nPolicy Montana Brazil you know but then to Brazil\nOr not too long ago we had a great conversation and she told me the truth she said the stuff happening on the left is wrong she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it up when I hear people like her and I hear others not denounce\nThis violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage she saw the backlash when she came out with her book that really took the uh the DNC and the Democratic party to task and she saw the felt the blowback\n... she better scurry back on the plantation and that's what she did it at the end of her her a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership\nPeople in the Senate you're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate\nMeeting exhibits leadership was called this crap out for what it is to tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know or their tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do say anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not just trying to to frame of narrative\nAnd a ... everybody knows with chef too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they tried to uh when they're forced I should say to say that Anthony ... and some of these other goons this I'm\nA feminist moment when they're pulling their crap you know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their\nSilence give tacit approval to this political violence or and sheriff Clarke before we let you go or the\nDemocrats Stacey Abrams in other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented um people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claim to represent a and now we have this\nIs mad a crash about to happen again on the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with the with children\nBy this is dangerous to continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on this stuff she doesn't represent undocumented any by citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and want citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges that are in the constitution\nOr belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing\nThe the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nOh and then again I'm this Congress must work with the president both on the wall\nAnd of course allowing for immediate turned backs at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening\nAnd it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America and to this country I completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there no one's in there and no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment of truth that really is\nA terms of his administration I support the president's policies on immigration illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out\nThere's an elite this broken or immigration system to\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else so that people are proposing follows sealing the border because if you don't steal the border we just saw last week was still a guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen of beating that's been deported six\nTimes lore six we heard stories of people who have been caught that have been deported\nThirty times that's not a made the number but the ... the border is so poor or easily or they can easily get back in Seoul no it's a matter of\nUm you know the eleventh hour and and I don't know we're going to maintain the house I I I Hope when I say we the ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're not going to fix this immigration system they're going to give citizenship\nOr through some measure of illegal aliens and let's see I'm Talking about and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that the Senate that will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and I'll squandered\nTwo years for heaven's sakes with a very a strong\nPresident ... arms of stealing the border and

street reporter he slit his throat in front of a camera I don't know what type of man it takes to cut the throat of somebody in front of you like that but I can tell you this is an individual probably were ranch rear end about having waterboarding his base\nHe never believed for a second year we're going to kill you know and let me tell ya he uses fingers to count the number of seconds because he knew that in all likelihood we would stop at ten it's doesn't sound like a person is afraid of dying\nWould you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your opinion on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and lacking or don't any more they understand\n[noise] so once again we have here the concept but just so half of the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this is confrontational\nAnd of course in the eye and for the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western socialists\nThey think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be integration anything ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say\nWhat you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring point that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it will review says he's going to do something he's going to do or\nDie trying we don't have a wall yet but not for lack of trying and we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying now the Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read burst issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of\nA sudden Trump wants to once again take away\nHealth insurance from people with pre existing conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants to do this there's no Republican wants this is the reason the Republicans ... going for a full repeal of Obamacare as pre existing conditions\nWhich they get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being coverage is not even insurance there is no way you can get insurance if your house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's going to sell your insurance was the houses on wire or after it's been robbed\nSo we're not even talking about insurance but we are\nAs far as the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house and the Senate wants to take away health insurance or brings\nUs thinking missions when did this happen no Republicans out there saying that\nIt's sort of like when Joe ... a ... at the doorstep Annapolis was interviewing um ah well questioning Mitt Romney in a debate and he asked and you think the states should be able to ban contraception Romney look the rest of what\nNobody's talking about that stuff and I I don't care for that he's talking about why don't you think ... states have a right to ban contraception Ravi looks around I guess what we're not talking about something you know George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wouldn't even think of this why are you asking me I just want an answer quit stalling you the states\nWill eventually Romney answered it\nAnd it didn't matter what the answer was it allowed the media Renee discusses states banning contraception [laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war on women\nWas reborn and that's what this pre existing condition garbage let me see

Republican voters no matter what other issues they have that is the issue it has been poll driven and tested in terms of being a very helpful to Republicans and of course the Democrats don't want to talk about it after stately\nThey're trying to gin up all this stuff about pre existing conditions well Leslie stall here is trying to do the same thing by suggesting that\nTrump is hostile to our good friends in your life it just you can't solve hostile why what you want a fence so hostile it's like when she was talking to Jose Jose Rodriguez why would you give them in short that's the stuff they give cancer patients so mean that's not who we are so you're so hostile and ... what was lost all\nThe way they treat us is one tough so we're not hostile\nShe says yeah but you can't deal with them without he says we have been the stupid country for so many years and that you find that you're willing to get rid of the western alliance no I like NATO NATO's fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO you know what else\nThey said in his interview secretary of defense\nMattis came up Trump's that I Know more about NATO than matter does\n\nHype man is as far as the deep state is concerned is\nNATO any army general wouldn't be NATO So Trump\nJust [noise] as men or the fair magazine says and it's a surprising admission\nSixty minutes was out matched by Trump the president talked over Leslie stall and read what was blaster Miranda rights that seemed more rallies an interview\nLeslie stall will not be happy all of a Vanity Fair they all live for puff pieces\nIn Vanity Fair particularly news people because the fair you know is is Hollywood star celebrity mecca magazine and if you had mentioned Vanity Fair\nHere I'm done massive crossover you've crossed over from news\nDo entertainment supposedly doing both not to be discussed by Vanity Fair that's not a bullet point that's not a resume and the answer sixty minutes aired\nAn interview with Trump rare for its status as having appeared outside of Fox News or conservative media appearing the same weekend as first lady Melania Trump on twenty twenty this would\nSeem to represent a new level of media blitz seeing on the part of it administrators shouldn't it's already seen its\nHead and get plenty of free promotion during rallies broadcast and cable news\nAnyway they go on to crash Leslie stall and trash CBS for letting Trump\nWalk all over them to just continue to dominate\nWith three little went lists rhetoric CBS let Trump get away with the same kind of persona

accessible president you've ever had this guy will stop and talk to you wherever your gathered if he's on the way somewhere and sees you he stops in talks to you and he tells you exactly what he thinks\nIt's not\nHis fault if you can't keep up with him it's not his fault if you can't play your usual journalist games and dominate him and get away with re characterizing what he says looks like or thinks\nVanity Fair is just admitting it is very very very frustrated that they can't treat Trump successfully the way they treat all other Republicans they want to get rid of\n... you know read
