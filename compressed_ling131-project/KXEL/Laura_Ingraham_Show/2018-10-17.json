the media obviously played a big role in getting people are very outraged about that a\nThat this was going to continue and get worse and indeed we had a thirty eight percent jump in family units crossing the border in the month of August from the month before a so this is no surprise I some deal\n[noise] no absolutely not a law and actually a sort of but it took this long for a cure event like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no cubs cuddly a spring the president's effort to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals' if your purpose would come to the United states has to live and work in the United states and you get relief\nYou've got to let you want it let's say it's the center for those individuals curve to the states we need to cut off his leg hurts the credits was tempted to do it but Congress has stepped up and you know frankly the polls is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to just have these families that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases ...\nExpand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families that their cases could hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated out circa ... cases will be the night and those folks can be returned United States but you can also uh you know they\nChange the asylum laws so that you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico that you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum Guatemala they should be applying for asylum let's hope it they're not in addition to the uh the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where unaccompanied alien a miners have to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in that they can end the floor as a\nSettlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they are ... and it doesn't matter how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter I said it's a it's an emotional manipulation game they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republican back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages you want to point babies how many times that we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults Barry briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into\nThe best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but\nHere's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders under the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw a National Geographic of all things\nI wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any cubs fan their child traveled through the night without food\nHow in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous during the United states is beyond ...\nWell when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nWho is paying for this like ... there's no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it costs to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expected administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for very brief period of time and unfortunately the economic which probably working their favorite this is another incentive again you went back you verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory verify that the keys the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so those are the cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case that that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we are talking that you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under five orders for local they received their due process law it's not like\nThey're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states will continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading end eyes just lack the resources to go out and find one season Tuesday's or people\nYou you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a file or removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries but everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work\nWith any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on ah with me last night aren't and he\nSaid that the folks in a Guatemala\nWho are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the called coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get in the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when ... when when authorities interview you so this script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nThe same and I fear for same for my family they were going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang\nConcern correct from the asylum a consideration he already has done that through a mind security bill I think it was attached to that bill yeah\nAt but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop about Seventy five to ... percent of all people who claim credible fear found to have credible here even though the asylum numbers are as well as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a planes into the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\n... chest needs to give that authority back to ... or ah the Justice Department needs to give that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make determinations whether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical\nWhile and also a as if he or someone else made the point when someone claimed domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nSomeone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there's no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it is it while it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse well it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nA local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place that actually prevents the United states government so it's as to whether or not that claim took place in the whole country nothing that's contain asylum application can be disclosed\nTo anyone outside of that asylum pursuing we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nI think everybody should be able to afford to sell shrimp treatment and the fact that we shift insurance mix it within reach for every guy\nTo find out more and our Cedar Rapids also go to low T usa dot com\nThey're silent killers invisible to the human eye and they cause three billion dollars in losses each year nematodes rub corn and soybean crop stealing ... along the way until now begs escalate powered by name is that the treatment offers farmers and effective way to manage nematodes and insects and providing control within forty eight hours\nAnd because escalate powered by any mistakes comes standard on all back the your crops have an added advantage and no additional charge visit big hybrids dot com to learn more today [noise]\n...

properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by these so called mainstream media and it isn't ah we went up almost six hundred and\nPoints yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in the economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore we do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk about myself\nAnd what about the your tweets herself for these people to say we don't want any more tweets everybody ever tried to stop tweeting oh\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port\nHandles disaster so

releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might that all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mahler

around during judgment on to the most explosive aspects of his inquiry into\nWhether there were clear incidence of collusion between Russia and Trump [laughter] believe me that wouldn't wait long ago there isn't any of that and the second thing is whether the president took any action as it comes to the obstruction of justice\n\nAnd Bloomberg goes on his face on things that I could look like they're pretending that there's even more being investigated besides collusion an obstruction but there is and then they say there's the question of timing is critical mothers work won't be concluded ahead of the midterm elections when Democrats hope to take control the house\nAnd and Trump's one party hold on Washington but this time line raises questions about the future of the pro itself Trump
