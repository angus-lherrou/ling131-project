thirty five by Tom would former\nAir force pilot a national security columnist for the Washington Times and the editor in chief of ...\nDot com it's gonna be talking about uh the national security aspect and getting into [noise] it is interesting theory now to understand a little bit more\nAbout me I have a background in Russian studies actually have a degree in what was Soviet Studies at the time now Russian studies and so following the Soviet the former Soviet Union or what's going on there and the U.S Russian relations is a an area of great interest to me\nAnd in fact I Am I'm Still very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians um about about one of them are putting them what vitamin potent wax\n[noise] and it's interesting because she said to me and and this is always stuck with me while I'm a ... does not care does not care who is in charge in America\nWhen a lot of reporting cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength in our Democratic Republic to use those against remember what am I putting some martial artist\nUp and so when he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about ...\nAbout a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about a someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact\nWe don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that you know so so that's that's but as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know what about what about the possibility what about the possibility that this could be a a a Russian effort and then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert he was actually attacked possibly by a\nA potent cronies present I I ... anti pollutant stances he he specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't an interesting I have it be if you're the Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to and designed to do what's happening out more of this you know and so in some ways we shouldn't were allowed me to lie to marry strange moments and and we have no idea where it\nComes from we have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything what that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy theorized and again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post marked on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's a very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's a very strange to me [noise] but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all the episodes from happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announced is\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by Bob uh signed by I'm a ... President Reagan\nAnd negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty why Tamir ... turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're gonna start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale if it wasn't remember there are some who are literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nWhat are we trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked the we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what ...\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\n[noise] in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five forty war that is a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew longer I Am sitting in for and grim\n\n\nNews talk for a actually a\n\n\nIt's your last week to get the genius of sunspot correct or for free for sunspots age spots and even read in plain patches Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sunspot director she says it's her go to product every day she had sun spots and aid spot can definitely see a difference in our skins into using it\nAs much to visit miss and chaos as possible in in American political circles this is what he wants to to do\nI mean given the fact that I Want to talk to you about your thoughts about America pulling out of the INS treaty 'cause you've written about this given the fact that we pulled out of the INS treaty last week um and and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed on the ground in Syria\nIsn't there even the barest possibility that this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the time he just to type for it to be that kind of an operation\nWell it was possible I mean look they just sprayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah field several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nFor you know the vice president's et cetera are of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my ... you know I have reporters all over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that it's just one and\nLet me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's gonna target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can lose the data on that\nBut what you know that he's going to target these countries I talked to what is it what does that mean and and how are you what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the INS\nAnd and how are you what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threatening you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with that person to is against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the court and it sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever\nIn the in the uh targeting a timeout holes that carry this\nTime and this is a ... it's literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before it and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can\nKeep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThe you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with I had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot or he is a national security columnist for the Washington Times on this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia\nBring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the ... show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\n[laughter] yeah well I Know I\nHave a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy their language I you know learned about the Soviet Union are flying through the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years focusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that\nThe west especially Americans and you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell on the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was always a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I'm also learn the language of you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for people to talk to us but the hottest show dog to how to show\nUp my but my my question unlawfully people what they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire and and uh you're exactly right and some things like me well thank you Buddy Guy ... [laughter] I think it was supposed to be able to\nClaim that a little bit explain explain what that means in the modern context of one of the modern Russian Empire looks like\nBut I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it'll exist today as a monument and so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union\nWas one of the most productive successful countries they said do you\nReally have the world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union pitch to them that destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet\nUm you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about that\nBut I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual that you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want colors and the Obamas or their their entire administration on down we're the ones that clear to Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you looked at a what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was an intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work you're doing and I listen I Want to get in touch with you want I Want to talk Russian when you\nSay oh well I don't you can always go to ... them dot com the S.

credit and their lighted tall live close to the election to God and yet the\nYeah I was I I I think there's this thing possible that's why this piece this morning and thank you very much for the call 'em you know we've got the situation MSNBC has been Collins us just in the mail bomb suspect reads the Drudge Report and Fox News or something that one of the earlier callers which was hinting\nAt which is sort of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call me step back I don't mean that in what I mean is that you have Democrats who will perpetrate these kinds of crimes as a way of raising the stink you know I'm a ...\nBut you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes\nAs a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a a feminist activist in Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened to turned out she was spending threatening emails to herself or the same thing happened just recently with another democratic activist or on a college campus up you know at this issue of\nFolks who who claimed to put up I'm the founder of anti Semitic graffiti uh only to racist graffiti only to find out that it was in fact done by the people who they claim that we've seen this happen before\n[noise] so that's why I tend to discount of these things let's go to a let's go to I'm Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the ... show\nThank you a question that should be at the one that we heard already gone over and it got five weeks ago by liberal under our during the cabin on hearing or not what who benefit from that other word\nFor it couldn't believe that if I if I can have it so I Would act even though I disagree with that on that it completely let's go next to their own ... who benefit from the delivery package\nA to anti Trump equal or course it's the lack of course it is and I agree with your caller there was never any attempt to hurt anybody it's odd year when the question has to be asked\nIf it's the Latin miss a lot in question in ... in in ... in the law cui bono who who who to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with the ... razor here\nI'm a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one\nI Know I I've said that a couple of different times but I Want to make sure that a hammer that point home sort of we talk about these things but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form does he want to have this conversation uh yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are not yet you know the cameraman and his brother up in your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained than influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that's the way that they built this they're bomb there pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet\nAnd so uh that that I found fascinating there is a real benefit\nA real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power I that's true to an extent\nBut the what the Russians are really want is they want chaos or my thank you very much for the call listen when we come back\nBecause I Do want to talk a little bit about the primaries in a couple of folks of Aspen to talk about the caravan and the chairman situation or we are going to talk about that in the last hour the show are going to be joined by Steve Cortez or because it it all fits into what's going on here\nBut we're going to be joined by state representative Katie Arrington uh she's from South Carolina she's running in the south Carolina's first congressional district\nI Want to talk a little bit about what I call the fly over effect\nOr how we cannot discount what is happening on the ground in these states in a whole host of areas\nI Am so she's going to be joining us we're going to be talking about the mid term elections where are we talking about what she is seeing and hearing on the ground there but in the meantime you can get you didn't it's we I mean at Andrew underscore line you're on Twitter you can call in eight five five forty Laura I'm Andrew ... sitting in for Ingram here on the lower income show\n\n[noise]\nNews talk ... J actually ah\n\n\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage there should be because ransomware does exactly that loses Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect divided up as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ramp somewhere just to back up your computer often\nHere's one reality right and again the thing that makes America great one of the things that make a make America exceptional is that anybody can come here legally and become an American it is the beauty of who we are as a nation that being said\nBorder security is an essential aspect of sovereignty if you don't protect your borders uses only McChrystal General Stanley McChrystal not some you know right wing bomb thrower was on CNN this morning talking about a ... he was asked about the caravan and one of things what he said was that a a\nA a border security is an essential aspect of sovereignty\nAnd your uh it's clear your constituents near potential constituents gift that why is it that but what was your opponents say about this I won't get away our our our the Democrats in his district taking this\nSo my opponent Joe Cunningham the mayor of Los Angeles Garcetti here to campaign wow do I need to go any\nFurther or do you really you really don't I mean that that seems you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a girl from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\n[noise] it just it because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right you know\nDemocrats don't have a platform is year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we had the best economy we've had in generation though yeah the lowest them climate\nAnd Burr and if people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe that Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country they are toxic they're all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody\nThe exact opposite of what an American should be should stand proud and strong to gather as a country\nMy ... my dose of South Carolina state representative Judy Arrington she's the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody ... obviously off the front pages today but this was we got to\nBe the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them because of um ah ah because of the other things that are in the news the suffix bomb story and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an officer we were never gonna see GDP above two percent of the Trump McConnell you're turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks are talking to they see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets are\nHow are they on those sort of uh the Trump ... tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nOnly all love more money in our part you know this from the you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path\nWe need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class get permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that\nThat is that's going to be a huge focused on going in that fashion but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area of bowling being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people [noise]\nThe terrorists no one likes that terrorists no one likes the tariff\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the world's best negotiator let them and do his job you don't regulate it got\nNo go ahead go ahead please just arguing\nAnd think well I get ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we do from in the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit because he told me and it's been part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republican believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it finally we've got Congress working with him on that and we have to keep them a mental going in at paramount as my ...\nLike far as my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove your walking marijuana and he's already been a little bit that sort of my one of my other Bailey works is is the isn't social regulation\nBut but you know and it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I called Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a ... year old when I was issue and roll number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight we're number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nBut you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself\nI mean this is this is the great folly of of of you know democratic negotiator fried negotiators of years is that they've always pre negotiated and eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we all you understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on mostly aluminum or see or what have you but nevertheless it is going to go shooting tactic to take the strongest positions don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day it's going to be a little bit cranky ... minute they're going to live a lifetime and never get sick\nWe have to prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it really is our country group we are the greatest nation on this planet because the hard work perseverance and the guts to stand tall\nAnd we need to do that right now China is not our friend they're never going to be our friends know that we have a president is going to stand tall against\nThem I guess you know I was going to ask you about about how your constituencies are looking at this this bomb possibly but I really want to focus more on substance here I mean what about what does your what is the sort of your points response when\nWhen he talks about do you mean he literally I'm assuming he's you know for the rest of the Democratic playbook which is on do all of the great games here what how does he proposed to how's he ... the economy jump started\nOn it or not that smart [laughter] the only thing he's the only thing he runs on as you watch it on and he says I'm for offshore drilling in South Carolina well yeah no one is because there's no oil out there [laughter]\nOnly thing he\nRunning on a platform of I'm going to stop offshore bit\nOh yeah no one is because there's no oil out there [laughter]\nOnly thing he\nHe is running on a platform of I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I said\nYeah and well number one he doesn't understand the job of Congress that's not their job as president work\nAt a time and then he took that what he the only one who's a bipartisan experience well the only thing he has experience doing is lying to still keep all about offshore oil and getting them to endorse him otherwise there's no one he has nothing I get dated him\nIt was it ever get your point\nIn your your you know in an argument with somebody and you're down

I have received things from the Mayo personally that are the things that are more into a calculator or something with stamps on there that have not been cancelled wow the region or not\nAnd Andrew is because those are called SP ours which stands for small parcels and rules they can't go through the processing machinery or\nWhen you get a letter that goes for the machine\nA machine just spray it cancellation on there for efficiency of speed doesn't do that with those types of packages had those packages had a pipe and they're not a PVC pipe but their actual lead pipe or something\nThat could do damage yes it would have waited too much and it would've alerted people that there's something wrong with this are just not a gun through clerk clerk at the counter will look at it ask a bunch of questions and cancelled ... stamp shore so\nThe fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nLet me ask you this and and when we were running short on time here but real quick so it without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\nWell I think that's probably a third basing it on the fact that one of them was mailed and then ended up with a ... million returned to Florida I'm I'm I'm not exactly sure how they got FBI is a lot more clever than right or a robot\nWell this wasn't a listen I appreciate that that is that is incredibly helpful information and in the end right I mean we can speculate I can offer my opinion I can offer my perspective but we're also in the business of providing ... so Sean thank you so very much for giving us that you have a a great weekend right\nYes I'm no expert but I think I Know enough from working weren't good\nYou know just enough to be dangerous and make us all more dangerous addition I appreciate that was when we when we come back\nWe're going to be talking more about these issues were going to be joined by the court as we're going to turn our attention to the Caribbean we're going to be continuing to take your phone calls or at a a five five forty Laura also your tweets I'm Andrew ... sitting in for anger him here on the ...\n\n\nNews talk between forty and chaos the or\n\n\nHave you ever take in your car for an oil change in your mechanic find something wrong and surprise your hit with a huge repair bill\nIf a Mexican comes across illegally a he or she can be repatriated almost immediately but if you're not from a continuous country shore um Central America that's not the case it's a crazy loophole that needs to be fixed um but in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across\nA through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of travel ban but I think ... here's the bigger point I don't want to have that confrontation\nLess incentivized Mexico and find something else to make kind of threatening or threatened Mexico\nTo take care of this problem because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like it on this issue and they hadn't gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilitated these care of ants to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them and protect me via trade\nSays it will happen I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration\nAnd you have a situation in which she'll have migrants refugees in the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continuous part is it's interesting you talk about this is talk of the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Wanna say five five I don't remember a notice on I think that that goes north south I think it's ten ... ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea of summertime plea walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me and I'm thinking as he was on the eve\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger laws for of course border here's the reality the president was far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know and this isn't conspiracy theory nonsense citizen from some far right a website\nThe Laredo station on the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred Bangladeshis are crossing illegally not why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from back then dashed I'm betting that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic hairs\nAre so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here\nFrom Bangladesh you know even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally to Mexico I think it's very eye opening shore and tells us you know that that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for national security\nNot fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop this and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part we need to use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way it it that doesn't work if it comes to do it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get ...\nBut I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstates and I was looking force interstate eight this south of interstate panic goes right along the border in in Arizona and California and my guess is the Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to the thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth\nIs offensive anybody can come to America and become an American right that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else you do just about anywhere you go in the world I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan in the same thing Korea the same thing\nBut anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you and you cannot expect if you're going to come up here on moss\nAnd and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border um there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's it's a clear danger to our borders and actually turn a danger so you know I don't think it does and I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning totally insulting to America trying to make this a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what do they do they just call this race of course and and trying to dismiss us but here's here's the reality\nAh America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become a legal immigrant and you're so right the second you are you're an American no questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship and it is about borders and it's largely by this\nAnd the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship and it is about borders and it's largely by the way I'm going to go on to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting\nAmerican citizens many of whom happened to be minorities a black and Hispanic Americans I Believe soccer more than anyone from tolerating illegal immigration\nWhy because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market against illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans\nPerhaps the most of all the tolerate porous border\nYou know my my my my colleagues feeding motley and less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal of about that issue about sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty if we don't control who is migrating here\nUh them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who's coming in is pretty soon finds itself without a nation and we certainly don't want that seat court says how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nice to be on there and we're not tonight and on Twitter at courts as the C O R G E S C\nI Will listen I appreciate that will put up points on the underlying or show page I'm sure we have one ... thank you so much for joining us today Thanks for having me for it and it's interesting to see was talking about the issues of of people of color in America and one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really get a chance to get to was this issue of\nUh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they're doing a gala event tonight here in Washington DC uh you know president is really doing what he can because [noise]\nRight it's funny or the American dream is about everybody is about every what it's about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions whereby everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of a good economic news today uh the the we have the GDP out a GDP is it the third quarter GDP a three point five percent of a\nTenth of a percentage point above where it was expected that as a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets I did get an ice as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew\nPlease stop saying ah every two seconds but I get excited to fix up when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself to get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intimately to that\n[noise] uh Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me at angel underscore Langer\nPatty rides I found you good job filling in for Laura we need evidence comes from is this is the liberal sending bombs it must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much tension didn't Brennan writes them come from something am I going to go back and look at that I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly it wasn't the folks\nAt the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that\nWhen we got a couple more minutes here on the show\nBefore recalls out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets at Andrew underscore longer continue to take your phone calls eight five five forty ... is the number eight five five four zero L.

them if they don't\n[noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being in a lot of trouble\nHere reading actual ... eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why is it that happening now the Republicans round the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it\nAgain in order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow world this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once was elections are over if he gets a big win because this will be a mandate about him they if they really\nJust a moment we'll let's discuss it you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot in in this election there's no wrong answer her don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you'd think the compass essentially on the ballot this these\nMidterm elections in part or maybe ... close in Toto are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this is going to be their big moment where they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this was the beginning of the unpredictable\nI Will share something with it I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this is my hobby not keeping up with the blockers Mitt keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff\nAnd it's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist and they have ever since election day two thousand sixth day and they have been in various stages of panic\nAnd I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll\nShowing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen and that was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mild to panic about writing about you know what we all have been thinking about what happened in two thousand sixty in was an odd conned\nIn a ... mile to panic about it\nAbout you know what we all have been thinking about what happened in two thousand sixty in was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off result but it's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says but if the Republicans hold the house of representatives we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth and it was it was um was ...\nI wouldn't say there was panic ended up reading the written word\nBut it's slowly dawning on some of the last two years they have live with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand six team was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidates with\nHillary Clinton and so forth but over confidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistake and the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correct dismissing now they're starting\nTo begin to quite may be this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority and it kind of dumped tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example that a\nTrump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum devote because of the moms now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went that a Trump rally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river [noise] and I think the uh mid America center seats for this event and we're seeing like twelve thousand\nI'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line there were more women than there were men that were ever going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters when I got down there like me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with them like we don't have the inclination to getting their faces act like they do\nAnd so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and how how how could you voted against the guy doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing it on their sleeves like these crazy radical leftists are all doing\nWell it is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that this week a bomb scare stories can dampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes\nThe average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune to all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people that continue you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is is I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a\nUsual lessening of enthusiasm or a gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is that was it it's as important now is it wasn't too thousand sixteen\nAnd in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and the policies have been in that then the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies\nI think the ... the rally in Houston He was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now he said\nTwo years ago in the campaign and I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again and we're going to stop there's going to make a trade deals better but back then it was just\nOne that was just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think Trump supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um the attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to his spirit them a or to somehow we give them their enthusiasm so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called
