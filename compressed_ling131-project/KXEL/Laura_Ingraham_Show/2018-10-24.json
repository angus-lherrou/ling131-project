grow up this district and all the taxes the strongest advocates for border security are those immigrants who come here whether the Hispanic or not particularly in Spanish and taxes come here legally\nThey know what they got a note or walk or he got\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democratic Party particular frankly some Republicans you're\nA supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country and so they look the message of order security strong immigration standing up for our country is selling well

can definitely see a difference in her skin since using it\nUh in one of the most beautiful states or one of my favorite places as Minnesota a car and joins us now the races pretty tight\nUh the latest real poll shows that the Democrat is up\nI'm about six percent\nAnd I think that is within striking distance no doubt about it a car and it's good to have you with us how are things going on the trail\nI it's gone just great Laura thank you so much for having me and yeah we have closed the gap in the polls that when you're speaking out was done by our our Minneapolis Star Tribune and which we sometimes called the red star\nA and that one had the damage at six and then the one before that and that again the capital happy down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting a green book and had a big debate the other night are only state wide televised debate and my opponent at chose not\nTo show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow would that be even possible I mean the Democrats\nDemocrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have\nMade some fairly significant headway in in ah both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and\nA sense a you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has there been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against that now\n[noise] one of the doubt out we have ... or Minnesota is turning Brad across the whole state people are stealing it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina let's didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she do our\nLast and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground\nA and then she's also a for open borders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on TALK for another investigation so Minnesotans are are\nSome of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina's that didn't want to debate may or at least tell the people have Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of democratic fundraising and a visit to drum up support for some of the house candidates ... and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of the more vulnerable in our house candidates on but the Ryan said there's an enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state uh last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there\nFor some of the Democratic congressional candidates are and they they believe that if they can fully turn Minnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened to your so we go for it happened we could have told you what was going to happen on\nMinnesota is definitely turning red leaf slipped our state house in two thousand at fourteen to Republican state Senate in two thousand and sixteen or we've got up on the iron range which had voted\nDemocrat for more than sixteen years is now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's costs Fifteen ... all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president has joined finally somebody it's fighting for our farmers including their issues at the forefront of a campaign\nSo it's all it's all the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the ... I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy the height\nOf the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota there is a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nIs even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know thinks that she'll be able to\nJust snuck or the Minnesotan voters for more liberal policies and open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo route to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so ... current housley has got to win the seat that would be phenomenal news\nAs we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota He he he didn't want it last time around but he made a Mitt valiant attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory\nOr current thank you so much best of luck in that race or for that Senate seat that was vacated by um the group or Al Franken All right we'll take a break eight

attention in the air time he deserves now but not as much as Andrew Gillum of courses who Andrew Gillum as he can't he can't do any wrong even when he does wrong or John James joins us now John it's great to talk to you you were fantastic\nOn the anger mangled last night we get we got terrific response to your parents I Know it was short but that's the nature of TV how you doing today\nI'm doing great and thanks for having me back on\nA John tell us a first of all I Want your reaction to this a series of comments about President Trump that when he says he's a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John here comments\nOr I I think that folks get so wrapped around the axle around the around identity politics and it's exactly what's driving as a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great honors that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans at the battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home\nYou know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics are the only things that are that look the same on us our our uniforms are we are together all American and I don't have a a black message or white Mrs I said last night but a red white and blue message and I I feel like you have\nUm the the progressive Marxist on the left who don't have a message and they don't have an identity so we need to use identity politics in order to keep themselves in power\nI reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving all up together is exactly what type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the alerts to claim racism or at every turn and to claim it's either a combination of ... being a wild a racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is ... ... it's so disgusting on so many levels and and insulting to Holocaust survivors and you know all people everywhere are but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no real solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nIn the Michigan Senate race clearly has no idea she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insults a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is a basic this is absolutely base you know we we learned the amount of the state of English class the logical fallacies ad hominem attack\nBy what you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on Debbie Stabenow\nA it for her part has been a career politician for forty three years has collected four million dollars and the tax payers only gotten five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and three of them goes by virtue remained buildings she writes bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but\nShe's a salad a as a New York senator voted with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five Ninety ... some of the time respectively and the promises issues made around\nAround Lauren pharmaceutical drug costs around\nTaking care of education and around um funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed and in our veterans who were coming back home she's broken bones and so when I say to her all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask is why should we believe you this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected\nThey engage in this politics to drive us apart\nAnd what I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we end all of this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this ah [laughter] I Love Debbie Stabenow now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nA majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie Stabenow standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\nA better trade policies against or China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants or forty four year career in politics to continue suddenly she's Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\nShe she is a selective uh in her positions she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her I'm ... now you can\nSee our debate a on John James for Senate dot com and follow around a but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against ... she's the court sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure our borders she's going up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades\nOr in in Washington and has failed to lead and so I Would say this is something we need to get done right now are we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd ah the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it\nSomebody who's going to work with anyone and everyone to get this done 'cause this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if Debbie Stabenow gets re elected on national security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nHey John what is the reaction\nAmong African Americans in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran\nAre you a West Point graduate are you um you're a Republican which is is you know is is not something that a lot of people in Michigan you know are are used to because the Democrats still have a\nYou know they'll have a monopoly on the black vote but are you finding you're getting\nMore black support in your state is or or does the Republican label's still scare people off\nWell I'll tell you what if people get to know me for me as people begin to disassociate a me from the are by my name or the color of my skin or they begin to realize that hey guys\nUm this uh this guy made 'em want a Republican primary in a in the state\nAnd uh I'm going to be the only African American to the top of the ballot and and people are starting to realize that everything that I'm saying a rings true you take a look at ... has failed to do ah with with uh with what concerns African American\nEverything that I'm saying a rings true do you take a look at what senator Stabenow his failed to do with with with what concerns African Americans and uh and Michigan is regardless of race round the state uh they're taking a look at this keeping an open mind and beginning to come over\nUh I I Believe that the only ones who are not are ones who ah who can't see past a a a a blind hatred or blind allegiance but those who I'm Talking talking to who are keeping an open mind I'll recognize the I'm the best leader\nUm Fort Michigan into the future or bringing balance an actual experience on both from a combat environment understanding veterans' issues and national security camera business environment understanding how to create jobs and how to protect the American dream for future generations to include our children Detroit\nIs the most segregated city\nYou know I Know in the country and it it's not that I Love those rights but the historic and one of the most beautiful places incredible architecture incredible history of music and arts and architecture tucked in and it was amazing decades of Democrat rule\nHave destroyed so many great American cities like Baltimore and in St Louis and and now uh of course Detroit making something of a comeback but\nUh so much more needs to be done John James best of luck to you and your race against Debbie Stabenow in Michigan uh everybody get out there and support a John he's just a fantastic a young man and a ... he has the right ideas for the state\nAnd he ... he doesn't want to be considered a African American Republican candidate he wants to be considered the right candidate for the right time for the state of Michigan\nA and John Wheeler she all the best and thank you for your service to

are we our way to see this um the drive by meaning and would love for everybody to see this in\nA vacuum as though there aren't any events that couldn't possibly me a related to this\nAnd couldn't be anything out there that could explain this except of course\nPresident Trump we've already had there's just there's just really deranged guy that worked for Hillary Clinton name fully brains he was already out there claiming that Trump did this to Trump's inspiring this the Trump is behind this uh James was noted Hollywood blacklisted actor has said that in the obvious to him\nThat this is a political ... for the leading up to the to the mid terms\nI have been scouring my federal memory\nAnd I can't come up with a I Can't come up with any or even a significant number\nOf instances in the past of Republican bomb threats Republican threats of violence\nUh I just it it may have been some but there are so few when they're so sporadic but what's what's put this in some kind of context or let's try and by the way let me joined the chorus of everybody from\nThey were going to be so excited they were going to be so motivated Republican early voting is dwarfing there's nothing out there other than Nate Silver and a couple of other polling you know does that suggest\nA blue wave and what kind of blue wave going to be if it doesn't include the Senate\nIf some people now that things are Republicans minds up to fifty seven fifty eight seats in the Senate it's all a toss up I mean nobody really knows right now but the point is the conventional wisdom is not settled on what the Democrats always thought it would have been telling us that would be and that is Republican massive landslide defeat\nThat doesn't look to be in the car so if you're a Democrat operative\n[noise] and the mob tactics haven't worked and\nIn fact if you're a reasonable democratic operative when you're looking at this objectively you might make including this mob action could be\nHurting it could be really firing up Republican turnout as in the post Kavanaugh period there is a cabinet effect and it's going one way pro Republican documented\nOr what if these mobs only did the Republicans minding their own business in restaurants and in the airports what if he was mobbed attacking people aren't doing anything to anybody and sending supposedly rice and\nTo Republican Senator Susan Collins a Republican or a rat or a democratic operative you might start to conclude\nThis is going the exact opposite way we intended ah\nThese mobs or not inspiring even more hatred of Trump these moms are not causing even more hatred of Republican and in fact is looking like it's\nCreating more support for Republicans so what would be the best way if you are a democratic operative and you weren't panicking right now\nLike it's\nCreating more support for Republican so what would be the best way if you are a democratic operative and your panicking right now because this is it if you don't if you don't get the house now\nYou got two more years of Trump and expanded Republican Senate Republicans keep the house Trump's resist the reelection and twenty ... this is just like we think it's it for us\nBut they have thrown everything they have it getting Trump they've ... they've had the FBI they have had that deep state signed it cool and they have thrown every trick media accolades doing they're tough lifting for them and none of it none of it none of it has worked\nSo what would you do Democrat operating the best way to turn all of that around\n[noise] how about a day like this\nHow about a day like this where you create a scenario where it looks like a moms are on both sides it looks like the Republicans have a mob Jew or at least ... some Republican out there sending bombs to the Senate\nGood\nDemocrats and media people former Democratic presidents and and and and the harmless people at CNN wouldn't it serves your purpose if you're a Democrat operative to make it look like the Republicans are a bunch of insane lunatics and helps the mobsters on their side as well\n\nVery same people the media says Republicans hate the most isn't this interesting George Soros Hillary the

yet but we'll see who they actually\nPoints for that I really don't trust the people at all it is so well if you're anything to gain power back in ... so it just stopped thinking a lot to be honest\nI only I Am so I I'm I'm I'm happy to hear you say that with a fence like this happened I always wonder what the ah reaction is going to be from people who are actively engaged in in these events each and every day and informed about them and the reaction gives me a gives me great solace and comfort because your reaction as pure commonsense\nIf somebody really wanted to hurt somebody with a bomb there's ways to do it this is not how you doing this or that these bombs haven't gone off these are pipe bombs\nSome of them are large some of them are small we don't yet know what was in the ... with shrapnel what was it tax was it males was if a bookshop where we don't we don't know any of this yet none of these bombs would have been capable of taking out a building they were not big enough to be\nBombs and just structural damage if they went off they could have killed some people are given their size so but none of them did go off and they were discovered a mostly and distribution centers\nBy the by the post office and I'll tell you what\nIf this is real Tania if\nThis is real\nI'd be a by the post office and I'll tell you what if this is real\nTania if this is real\nWhoever did this is going to be named by the end of the week and we're going to know who it is\nI agree if it if it's really at\nThis point I felt this tracking the ... I wouldn't put it past the only pay somebody off I really do that stress thing and the Democrats um so anyway we have a lot of like ... the let's see what else they put out there and that\nWas exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July to pose you really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do\nNot so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winter but the polls today can be highly influential\nAnd decisions and action taken by political people now I just I Love Tonya thank you very much for uh for calling uh yeah and again for mentioning Bob Ford it really is one of the finest guys anybody could ever made [noise]\nAh\nI look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly\nExperienced here at analyzing predicting understanding the left\nAnd I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is that it's there's that that they are entitled to it\nAnd whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American Left just angry as it can be that people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them and they left is making every every\nEffort it can to distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office to force Kavanaugh out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling\nIs something you and I cannot relate to we can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling and having lost\nThat election and two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like ... you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump and I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are easy for them to take out Republicans whenever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously but they haven't been able to even score on Trump\nSalt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they and they created as a whole cloth something that does not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and it began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump\nThat now that they've seen trumping actually hate him to despise him they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became the narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumpet action they've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left taste now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated trumpet everybody hated themselves are voting for him\n[noise] well it isn't coming to pass the blue wave\nThey said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that was soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave or Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house it's working iffy iffy and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing Democrat turnout in early voting early voting is one of the Democrats get to run their fraud scheme smokes early voting is where the illegals votes and the debt votes and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears there are more sophisticated than the Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats getting away with what they usually get away with\nThe Republicans were showing up in droves they're out performing at political rallies Trump won twenty thousand people Fifteen thousand people another twenty five thousand people outside block Obama can't even draw one thousand Joe Biden Hillary Clinton can't draw flies there is ab jet panic\nSetting
