public and we are not saying we gonna kill anybody we gonna hit anybody oh we're going to cause anybody harm that's a lot in the way that they are trying to redefine protest\nIs is that correct I mean what are your thoughts on\nOil [noise] um [noise] my thoughts are this that\nOutlook officials and and\nI I'm not a perfect public official but I think we're all on a set\nAn example of civility and so for US Senator say get in their face\nFor congresswoman like her to say get in your face and then what happens is the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants that are surely\nThat is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong a I Believe in\nFreedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate but it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or congresswoman doesn't in Ghana violence there's some people that are going to take it one step further\nThan she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and are not\nSurely not being your face if you're going to have a democratic and ...\nAnd she needed to back off about ... steps stand or not\nIt surely not being your face if you're going to have a democratic\nRepresentative government function properly uh I got to be a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a nice guy a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nA and what does that mean let me she's had this um lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes in and take him out\nAnd she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and\nTelling people that get harassed in restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... get shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that\nBut when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have poor old Susan Collins people being ... its screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and then in public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection and we have\nBut then you can't have police protection\nFor five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police or you can't do that as well\nSo are are are I've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but our democracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what\nIs happening or when you go on quote get in their face\nWell but what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to uh to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is cornering more women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe people threatening to kill

going to you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help but so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise it but they gotta they gotta responsibilities Reno ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that or I'm waiting for that undergrad there\nGo ahead you know wait a long time I think\nSenator Grassley a the lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga of many of us thought\nThat in the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and and kicking off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then I got delayed because of the Ford allegations\nAny thoughts to solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings pass the the closer the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\n[noise] well I've read your\n... your took me to tears called me for for not calling for a whole bunch of but you can't you can't you ... if I called the vote today you want to do we went along we we weren't all tend to tend to rely on and so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here are doing it\nAnd so we we waited until we had the

right we got pantsuit orange today and things are looking for moderately\nTerroristic pantsuit yellow caution at the airports\nSee something say something all those ... yeah oh I see something I see the implosion of the Democratic party now it's celebrities abortion\nOr radicals who've infiltrated the black lives matter movement that what is what some Democratic Party that its abortion it's I guess it's algae B. T.\nBo powder open borders free but real will tree in open open markets open borders climate change climate change the to sign on school level yeah and\nDon't I don't see what else you know okay but the algae BJ community done really well during this economy that really well at that all Americans\nOkay but the LDP community it's done really well during this economy that really well as has all Americans we don't have the segment Americans\nInto this or that group to say we want all Americans to do better we want them to live in safety security whatever your your ethnicity as long as you're here legally we don't carry a sexual preference you all of a sexual brother he okay fine whatever sexual preference you want but enjoy this economy\nIt's not brought to buy constant protests it's bought brought to you by hard work from Americans who are starting businesses\nAnd and believing in the American spirit again\nThis is good so why so angry I ... I think a lot of it is embarrassing they're embarrassed that they were so wrong about this so the more Trump's exceeds the anger they get right it's kinda like when you see or\nYour ex girlfriend go on a date someone much cooler much you know it's like wait\nWait a second we broke up to two years ago and\nNow I don't know she's gone on warps yeah\nWell guess what they they they are angry that they didn't get on the Trump train a lot of people that should have gone on the Trump trying\nAnd they didn't and now they're just trying to derail the train but I think the transit of keep checking down the tracks but you got to turn out and vote in the midterms are you got to turn out and vote my friends you cannot be complacent because the left is banking on your complacency\nHow many have you have already voted early voting starting already how many of you've already voted our plan to vote early I don't like like voting on election I don't like the early voting is is is is designed to help the left because they're more lazy and they don't want to go to the poll\nWell but but think about this if tomorrow\nSomething today something ruined his happens where I don't know your candidate opens fire into a crowd or at a baseball game\nYou have no way of turning your vote that you can't reclaim your vote I think you vote up until the election that you vote on election day so you have all the data not this early but I Know people who they vote the a month before the election two months it's ridiculous\nYeah I uh I think the early voting is a little much ...\nMotor voter all that motor voter early vote I Know the next to vote on the Internet oh there's no fraud pops possibility there not at all it's not going to be any gaming of the system was that\nI was upset to learn motor voter wasn't drive through I thought it was dry dry out and see I'd like that because then I could get my drive through ... and my vote done at the same time maybe at the same play it is and nor and that would be very ... that's an attractive possibility to the doctor has to be seals when you get the drive\nThrough ... well no they put a top on it they give you the straw yes they give you the strong because you're just transporting that that arise thinking and no no oh you'd never do that\nNever never drive the back seat that the people in the backseat of going there ... they had the last run that was during the last ... [laughter]\nBut it is ridiculous my favorite is when you see these\nPeople they take the gallon ... from the window [laughter] you know the goal of solo cups and the\nCar all that stuff I used to drink that stuff in college I Do love decker is\nThey are like they're basically jar bucks smoothies with rum sugar and Grand Isle royale which is worst sugar is I'm Sorry but sugar causes cancer you know it does that process food is all wars don't get that ...

I think it's that the way the wheat binds onto your your your brain cells and it it it builds up that plaque I'm Sorry I'm doing a lot of reading on the GMO I don't like the gym on a ... I'm going to have to just eat some let us I'm a grownup backyard\nBackyard lettuce that's on I have kids who gets grounds for every bark and flour and get your baby gone the squirrels looking tasty tonight I'm hungry\nThat's the gray gray is out there All right a five five forty one remaining time jammed very quickly I Can't hear jam [noise]\nAll right then the whole Rite Aid five five forty Laura are coming up congressman Jim Jordan I bet he wants to document redacted are too don't you think some go\n\nTalk Fifteen for\n\n\nYou guys heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow guys I used to wake up with a sore head I often have one of those critics in my neck\nGradually is never going to come on a gun I switched to yourself I liked that it took me to task I loved that was really good one for the capsule I liked that congressman Jim Jordan also you wouldn't know it may be because he's always on some serious topic but he is a great sense of humor as well Congress worry I get it that\nWell I'm I'm I'm you're not unlike you I Love Senator Grassley a and you know he's been talked on this whole Russia and if you're in a court to comment on you but that was funny [laughter]\nIt keeps it at one that's the ... what's the ... when he was upset and it's like one level like\nTell me [laughter]\nI Love 'em he did a fantastic job and I mean not backed out here now I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on now we had\nYou had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein or the other day down to where the heck with a sign of Florida yeah and I saw rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said well yeah I think some picks he does on the president what did you know he's suddenly your best friends what what what's the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and they could give it McCain memos that we used to peanut\nThere are all these stories out earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire or tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording wherever they want to do\nUm and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rosenstein not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure but we are starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was opposed to a tomorrow\nOr in a in the Judiciary Committee so\nI made me think like because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said that you are or is it the stories of said he said just in case and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker so a book will or will hopefully\nHe'll hopefully he'll take change his mind it will be there tomorrow so we can ask the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the uh the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why\nHis involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players on page McCabe call me\nA that is important and when it's now now being reported that uh he was he talk to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein earned that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein and never forget the fundamental fast\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted than left and of course Peter Struck counterintelligence demoted than fire\nTop people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein named Mr ... that's why this is important ... Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can ask you questions about all\nYeah he's not going to show there's no way I don't think it's my productivity to no no he's not going to he's not going to come I I just\nI I've I've got to say I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself or get wired go and take the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment go I I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance mean that is that this was the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spawn all this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen may ninth as the date Bernstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire calling me may seventeenth is one Rosenstein named\nBob Mueller as special counsel sometime in between her and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe on that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel and obstruction of justice and all the issues that all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\n...\nAgain the the main question that is on the table I think is my mother is going to do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve ale an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of Donald Trump\nAnd if that's the other hand are now you can you can start surveilling someone because\nThey traveled to Russia and said hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and\nCarter Page mean where does he go to get you know his reputation back and where does he go to get his legal fees paid my he's just twist it for years\nNow I'm a I'm a ... it's good you brought that up because we sometimes is important is to go back to the basics the Clinton campaign the DNC paid Perkins carry offer who paid fusion GPS who hired him for her\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally uncorroborated in that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other parties can and can't\nRead his what happened here and ... and they used the press\nTo get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is a ... works for them she get information to her husband's in front of it to the FBI so she gets information to resort to Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending a lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility always say the more people talking about the lie the either the law is to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie and they use that to go spy on the other camp it's\nWhat's in your long as the um what's your what's your sense about um the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans caught maybe some of the Democratic gains that there is some predicting in the house I'm well how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so and I was I was in or out about across our district and live in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that person it's helpful\nAnd a infant from very good manager was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the left has gone completely crazy we did it to the other day I had more people comment on that we said today's left a plot ...\nA lot of people are beginning to see that the leftist going completely crazy we did it to the other day I had more people come out and we said today's left a plot tapper Nick destroy capital\nAnd that's today's left ... they they embraced of radical you know ... when he disrespected the flag embrace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great Cheryl and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president or an old by the way the strikes happen all the parts of it I mean that today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters\nHope it is staying over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority now\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you have to do a lot of pressure to the law but my ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters deter first ran when we got what I what I called the treatment from a lady were\nOut and she started wearing a line of people get moving into the theater and um she just started\n... you know yelling shaming eagle and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that the people who were on the left but they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kind of just watch a little bit or\nYou know look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but despite about argue about the idea let's not let's not make it personal let's not well people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do that they found to do it and say it's it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing that you forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um since the U.S attorney in southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up or removing him as deputy AG let's listen\nI think the president realizes that if he were to get rid of a Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three than it would give mall or a reason to extend the investigation why what do you want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down have transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about over\nBut do you think about that yeah I mean I I it seems like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report\nKorea yeah I I Hope so and I think that that's probably a ... that can be right and uh obviously respect the McCarthy I'm In all the things he's written about always done so I look at all is going to be any changes made the Justice Department till after the election until after ... I think that that's obvious about it it's obvious that\nI'm the president once at a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point you but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election it until after the special counsel's work just finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to Congress set of Ohio congressman thanks so much will take a break close out this hour a lot more to get to Michael Savage is also going to join us stay there\nThe Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nWe're proud to serve a dedicated community of farmers in Iowa done helping farmers succeed means so much more than just being a great seat supplier or family of employees and dealers are committed to helping farmers the new challenges push boundaries and innovate can ever changing industry that's what makes it different we love what we do we are\nAnd will remain farmers at heart\n[noise]\nYour high school football connection is for down territory exclusively on the voice of eastern Iowa news talk Fifteen forty KFC yell [noise]\nEvery Wednesday night at six K exhale previews he high school football match ups which tells you interviewed details about impacts players and more [noise]\nAnd tore down territory Wednesday getting you ready for friday's big games anew talented team forty KFC out\nYour voice of eastern Iowa\nUsed all juicy bleak KFC Waterloo cedar\n\nAs a Fox News alerts hurricane Michael still on track to be the most powerful storms ever hit the Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony if you made the choice not to evacuate\nThe sign of places shelter sneak it plays the refugee governor Rick Scott Michael's I Will make landfall for a few hours but the outer bans are already hitting Fox is Jeff lock out in the middle of its\nOwn our own here we're not expecting any first response we get into your thoughts on off is on all of the people that I made the choice to say about politically charged these large structures that are theoretically a\nChoice to say I'm a city beach aren't these large structures critter theoretically arcane for for my story they are going to say I have several former Fox\nIs Evan brown has the latest on the hurricane line from Miami\nDade for most areas along the Florida Panhandle coast cities too late to leave for some other areas the evacuation window is sharply closing FEMA chief rock long\nAnd you need to leave 'em this is the final goal or for anybody that needs to get out or try to do so knows you stick around to experience storm surge do typically lived to tell about it\nEspecially with storm surge reaching nine feet or higher as of eleven am eastern Michael's holding wins in a hundred and forty five miles an hour the storm's eye is about sixty miles down from Panama City\nThey live and Brett Kavanaugh was at work at the Supreme Court hearing a case on immigration is the end of the FBI gets questions the capital about the newest justice Fox's Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nD.
