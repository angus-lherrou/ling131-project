day\n[noise]\nA grave saying TCU from God our father and our borders the Lord Jesus who is the cry\n\nWell there are many questions that\nChristian pastors in teachers get I\nAnd over again and one of the most asked questions is this\nSomeone loses their salvation Janet ... shouldn't be saved bandleader fall away from the fake\nNow there are some Christian denominations I drove by this motto D'Amato won save just always safe and if a Christian appears to fall away from the faith and that just means that they were never really saved to begin with\nWell our\nLessons from Hebrew is for today answers this very question for us\nSo if you have your bibles you can turn with me to ... chapters free or you can just listen to the proclaimed to work\n\nWell first of all I don't think it's an accident then are adults Sunday school time or last week we began talking about the book of exodus about Moses and will continue to\nHe went into the cross and died with him there and his life his innocence his perfect obedience his righteousness he gives to you and he didn't stay\nDead but he rose to new and internal life perfectly justifying you and ensuring you that same resurrection\n\nNow just because the people in the book of exodus we're actually saved\nFrom slavery in Egypt so Jesus actually saves you from slavery slavery the sin of slavery to death and the devil\nAnd Jesus continues to take care of you just as he took care of the people in the wilderness in spite of their provocation\nWe see Paul rice and first Corinthians town\nFor I Do not want you to be on aware brother and let our fathers were all under the cloud and they\nThrough the scene and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud in the sea and all they have the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed\nThem and that Iraq was cry\nWhen you see the people in the wilderness experience all these things going through the part of the red sea getting the\nBread from heaven man uh drinking water from the rock that God provided for them\nAnd Christ is the baptism of salvation price is the bread that came down from heaven Chrysler living water price the rock of salvation\nAll these are given to the people at that time by God's Grace and it gives them to you as well and that's where we place our face in our trust that our hope you don't have to be afraid\nOf losing your salvation you don't have to worry about losing your salvation because we don't look for the insurance of salvation and ourselves but we love to\nJesus and that's why Jesus can say I give a turtle lived to them and they will never perish and no one in the fall snatch them out of my hand\nAnd God is the one who preaches the gospel to all the God changes our hearts of stone into hearts of flash\nThose hardened by sin and those who have fallen away they can still hear the gospel of Christ and be saved\nNevertheless with most of the people God freed from Egypt God was not well pleased for they were laid low in the wilderness now these things happens as examples for us\nSo that we would not crave evil things even as they crave\nOr less syndrome he he Bruce tells us how we can help one another to resist temptation in our daily lives\nFirst Thirteen read about encourage one another day after day as long as it is still call today so that none of

brother and\nThis is where two or three get are gathered in line name God has given us this community the church but\nDouble in the world that are essential nature would like nothing more than for us to be isolated in by ourselves\nIn our sin but do not be isolated from one another and courage one another and not in an empty encouragement\nToo often\nWhen we try to encourage and comfort one another or either intentionally or unintentionally\nWe end up hurting one another when we try to converse\nInstead of saying things like well you'll get over it or time heals all wounds\nOr even well it's all part of God's Plan well maybe that's true but it just isn't very comforting\nBut instead encourage one another and the gospel of Jesus loves you he sang to find your son for inviting is suffering he's saying divide your death and the death of all believers by dying and rising for you\nAnd he sang to find your struggle against temptation by resisting own temptations for you know encourage one another when these things\n\nAre lesson reeds for we have become part takers of Christ if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance for until the end\nPolitics said today if you hear

us\nToday is the day when we can resist temptation and by the power of his spirit and said hey we can give and receive forgiveness and we can encourage one another day after day as long as it is still called today man\nLet us pray\nLord God heavenly father we are said we would be encouraged by are words that we would not be hard on that are seeing the non fall away from you about you and help us to

contemporary service that on them in school for all ages nine forty five if you haven't been to a church in a while or possibly looking for a change these except this imitation business Lutheran\nNow we find that the response was not very good they all with one consent begin to make excuse they begin to make excuses not to come to this rate soccer and today we find there are many that have excuses not to become Christians not to come to Jesus Christ and accepting his own personal savior\nOne of these men says while I bought a piece of ground and I want to go see it I pray they had ... think of it this man had bought a piece of ground\nAnd his excuse not to come to the supper was I must go and see here we have the last of the pie something to see is keeping this man from coming to this great shopper and\nA lot of people are occupied with things to see\nAnd allow these things to keep them from coming to Jesus Christ another says well I bought five yoga box and then I Want to go and prove that\nThis man had something to do this man allowed his businesslike to keep him coming and there are those today who are so occupied with their business their job and so on that they have no time for gone no time for the things of Jesus Christ and they are allowing these things to keep them from considering\nThe most important thing and that is the internal destination of their soul and they do not come to Christ\nAnother says I have married a white therefore I cannot come this man was allowing family life to keep him from coming to the great shopper and there are those today who are allowing family life to keep them from coming to the Lord Jesus now he says the master being angry being angry he said this\nThe great shopper and there are those today who are allowing family life to keep them from coming to the Lord Jesus now it says the master of being angry being angry he said ... quickly the time is short and call the poor\nThe main hall and the blind the my house maybe full

neither is our salvation in any other for there is none other than a month or haven't given among mean whereby we must be said your friend if you're going to be in heaven you must be saved their friend you must be accepted oh Jesus Christ is your own personal savior in order to enjoy this too great a salvation\nThe Bible says how shall we skate if we neglect so great salvation\nThese people that were invited they neglected to come to the soccer and many today or neglecting to come to Jesus Christ they're putting it off and they're dying and they're saying but the imitation is who whoever

case in the licensed seat it's management employees affiliates or parent company\nOf voice of eastern Iowa\nUsed to be very KFC Waterloo Cedar Falls\nThis is Iowa this week a public affairs presentation of the KFC yell news department\nWe're going to talk now about an annual events coming right up in the cedar valley one which you as a business owner or someone who wants to develop your own skills you should pay note to this conversation and reserved for time on your calendar joined in the studio by Heather Marquez of action coach mind links\nSeems like we were just talking about this last year we should probably talk more frequently or about their topics because they are very important when we're talking about live to lead and explain what is available to people in the cedar valley this is really a chance to have international talent helping people here at home\nYeah [noise] So Liz ... is a now an annual event here in the cedar valley this is my fifth year bringing it here\nAnd it is a time okay that was broadcast around the globe um we actually do it here as a rebroadcast because it gives us the ability to dig a little deeper into some of the topics presented for the day so that we can make sure that the attendees\nNot only getting great information but also leave with the ability to digest it and take something back to their organizations to implement and make a difference\nThe key with this workshop not that others aren't the same way but this one is very purposefully designed to not just be a time when people can't absorb information that might benefit them\nAlthough that is a part of it sells benefit you want to make sure that people pick up things that they then can take back and implement in a very action oriented way to improve the workplace and improve the business and that includes customers that on the other side\nAbsolutely I heard this great quote the other day and it said education without implementation is Jeff entertainment now we all love entertaining but my goal is always to take it one step further\nAnd make sure that it doesn't just go back in to the bottom on the shore or be the cool thing of the moment but that people actually get great content\nUm they have the ability to discuss that content with other leaders other business owners other people in the theater valley and then share ideas on how they're going to take it back and actually make a difference in their organizations\nAnd that's the key because again as you say just getting the information is one thing being able to put it into practice share it with others that is the most important thing we'll\nGive you the information multiple times but let's start by reminding folks that lived to lead cedar valley as October twenty six\nAt the Hilton garden in in Cedar falls it runs from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon L. to el cedar valley dot com has more information what can people expecting who might be delivering information\nMy goodness well first of all they can expect to see examples of leadership at all levels in our community um leadership that the one thing that really doesn't know any\nTo see examples of leadership at all levels in our community um leadership is the one thing that really doesn't know any boundaries that doesn't have any boundaries around age around socio economic background it doesn't even care about title\nUm race ethnicity doesn't care about any of that it's all about what we can do as an individual to impact the world around us and have influence and so some of the speakers that we will be hearing from\nUm that day include John Maxwell which of course there's always the headliner for this event and then Carly Fiorina which was a past presidential candidate I'm Daniel Pink who is currently one of the top five sought after business speakers in the world\nAnd then I'm Deborah sterile who has just an incredible background she rowed across the Atlantic ocean on assisted\nAnd alone I'm pretty incredible and then our biggest announcing that we just um\n\nNa na\n\nNa\nNa mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading today from John chapter three beginning of are sixteen to the end of the words of Christ you're not going to get much above Twenty one\nFor God's so loved the world that he gave his own maybe go to Shawn but who show Robert believe us in him should not get rich but held everlasting life\nFor dogs ... not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved\nEither believe us on him his notes condemned but he does believe us knowledge is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only big Austin son of God\nAnd this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and man of darkness rather than light because their age were evil where everyone that door evil hater the light\nNeither come to the light lashed his speeds should be re proved\nBut hey the door truth come after the light that is the age maybe made manifest that\nThey are wrong you're going\nTo skip thanks for these words especially for the gospel itself that are described in the sixteenth ... gone so loved the world that he gave his son\nAnd gave him to die to be buried enter rice again and he is now at the right hand with the father and will one day again return to our ... we'll see how that spray on his name\nOh we're father we do come to the through Christ alone\nWe have no righteousness and ourself we're under the Kurdish\nAs we read last week from by word curse that there's everyone that continue if not all of the things with the law to do with them but we give thanks father that crisis has been made a curse for us\nAnd we pray father that we might rightly know our own ... that we might rightly know by love and giving him\nWe give thanks for word that gives us the message that the gospel and that we can have faced by hearing and hearing by the way we're\nMakers to know them thankful not ... but also troubling than it is by word and that we might be poor before it searching whether or not we believe that word on the right way\nWhether or not we honor the name and are not left to take him in vain even when we read of the head of the word\nWe pray father that because of Christ will now teach us in Sendai spirit\nTo convict us where we needed to lead us into all truce where we need that and especially to take the things of Christ and show them to wash\nWe prefer their spiritual blessings first that we might be made to shake first by kingdom and die righteousness with the promise that all these things will be added\nWe give thanks for the many things that we do have that others do not have them food Raymond\nHolleman shelter\nThe blessing of freedom the blessing to nature\nOthers are suffering even of the ravages of nature\nAnd famine draw flood fire when earthquakes all these Clementi's we pray for the dog will be with them that are suffering\nAnd we pray that for my children in the midst of them that they may know that old things worked together for good for them that loves being are colder going to buy purpose\nThat there may be ... in those things to bring them back to the if they have wondered that if they have left their first love that there might be a revival in the church through judgments should grew calamity through chastised much\nWe pray for that we might be talked with all these\nChest has much of it could be the will we might be chased him by the word we pray for our homes the needs them especially the broken homes the children in those homes pray for those in sickness injury pray father for healing\nGives them face in Christ the great physician for healing because there's not they will give the immigration to burn fluids liberty of life the certainty abducted need to repair\nThe ... through life then paint on weakness we pray father for those in old age we pray for other needs are there are the hungry the homeless all these different calamities we pray father that\nThe water and judgment remember mercy through Christ amen\nLooking one more time\nYou're her killed James the Jewish liked it so he tried to kill Peter as well go deliver them other person that was that nation to home Christ was born to whom the word was given\nA little while ago there were much much every way particularly especially given the or goes the scriptures of gone and then having them hated the light do not want to hear killed the profits that brought the word through the years and killed the Lord Jesus\nGardeners love gave them they have been you know who is the light of the world that was John described it the first chapter\nThan him or her life and the life wars the light of male and the light shining within the darkness and learn to comprehend it not\nBeen John the Baptist scam the made ... called him the lamb of God that pick of the way this some of the world that's my only hope that name of God taking away my Sam paying for it on the cross becoming a curse on that tree\nThat's the gospel that's God's love that's why he sent him that the world through him might be saved and we didn't know are guilty we didn't know that we hate the light as well as were distributed to the whole law that's bad enough\nBut to hate God's love in Christ hate the light of the world hate the creator the one with a father\nBut if we recognize that and believe it and say I'm guilty with the worst than we do true we come to the light\nLater in the ministry Christ said there's some who profess to believe on him\nWhen you were lifted up the son of man and a new show more than I Am hay and that I knew nothing about so but as my father has taught me I speak these things John ... then we read on the thirty first as we speak these words many believed on him\nFor thirty one that Jesus said to those which we've done him if you continue in my word then are you a major cycles indeed and you know the truth bend the truth so make\nFried ... tenure when the word we have to be given the word the\nWonderful word the scriptures God's holy were\nTrue true true\nHe the door to come to the light if we believe were guilty by the word\nThan we can and humble not since ... called like state come to the light who wish Christ are these will be made medicine is that they are them rather than going to change will take place up to that time as Christ said further and John chapter write\nYou or your father the devil and works with your father you will do\nIf we don't want to know that we're centers that wasn't chapter eight when Christ said if you continue my word you will know the truth the truth will set you free they said we're not bone we don't have to be born again we are already right with God we are ...\nThere's people that think that today the Senate debate run by the blood but they're also people who think that in the church today we're ... we are would ever him under that promise the promise of what if you are ... that are about twice believing\nOn the Lord Jesus Christ believing in his name for the mission of your son which God sees that he's telling you about them in his word both by the law the gospel by the law or guilt\nOr the gospel or hatred\nOf the light believe in him today and you will be made great\n\nThanks for listening to call to worship\nIf you have

can work on a miracle with it bring it to Jesus when Jesus work through a she always uses what he has on hand\nA good definition of a modern day America whole in four words is man's best God blessed take once you have or what you are until the lord he could use it\nIs it strange that princess the kings and clowns that cable resolve this rings in common folk like you and me are builders for eternity\nWages given a bag of tools or shape plus my son a book of rules and each must fashion airtime has flown a stumbling block Cora stepping stone\nAnd now next is a lesson from Jesus showing how he works through us\nJesus did not ask him where he or they could buy a bread he said when the show we buy bread a Jesus was not asking them to do it\nAll by themselves he included himself in this deal he brought himself into partnership with them\nIt is good for us to remember as well we do not do the Lord's work alone when he gave the great commission to take the gospel into all the world telling them he that believe up than does baptize shall be saved\nHe said I Am with you always he went on to the end of the world he always works with us in his work the third lesson is on the responsibility of the church regarding the last\nAccording to Matthew before Jesus ask Philip\nLeader cycles head first come to him and asked him to send them all the way let them by their own bread it seems that the hunger the crowd was no concern over there\nBut Jesus said give you them to eat\nWhat's the lord serious how could they do that Jesus knew they could do it with a power that he would serve lie\nThe lord wants to do something we can do it\nFeeding them oh did you watch their responsibility whether they knew it at that time or not\nThe church today may not be concerned about lost souls in foreign lands\nLadies and gentlemen God will hold us responsible that he not say goal and preach the gospel to every creature\nWe must go or encourage others to go far pray for the lord the sand to others or support those who do go\nNow comes a great lesson in trusting in God that this event the feeding of the five thousand is one of the most dramatic events that ever happened in the word of God I just think of it Jesus told the apostles\nMake the people sit down and they sat down at\nJohns shows that I was much grass and the place mark so they were separated than sections of fifties in hundreds I just think about that imagine that you were there\nFive thousand people are sitting on the grass in groups of fifties at hundreds\nJesus stands up before them holding five small lobes\nAnd to fish is Denise hands he looks up to heaven and gives thanks for what they are a boat to eat\nNow what will you be thinking at that time if you had been there Jesus standing there with fire blows into fish is giving thanks\nWhat is going to happen Jesus proceeded to feed them all until they were filled and just in case there were a glut ... president and wanted seconds\nThere were twelve baskets full left over for them\nIf the apostle Paul and had been there at that time he would have said what he said do the fish in a fish in later on\nHe is able to do exceeding abundantly above all\nThat we asked for I think according to the power that workers in us under him be the glory in the church of Christ Jesus undo all generations forever and ever when we ever have any\nDoubts about the power of the Lord Jesus do what the multitudes did that day just sit down and wait Jesus\nCan deliver next\nIs an important lesson on what is really important when we assemble for worship\nWhen Jesus fed the multitude it was a staple meal he had no entertainment just plain fish and bread if they were looking for it if you're in a\nDinner about day with entertainment\nThey would have to go someplace else all the lord was serving that day was plain old fish and barley bread and there was no tartar sauce but they all eight to and we're field sometimes\nWe think every ... everything depends on entertainment\nOr we may enjoy on Sunday Morning the floor show with a theatrical performances and dancing very esteem if the world has ever to be one of the lord it will be because of the soul food the brunt of life that Jesus provides\nWhen they ate the lows in fishes\nJohn reminds us they all eight and were filled all\nClasses of people found the narration what they needed\nNo one said I just can't eat this stuff I eat it every day and I'm tired of it all the mandate it the few women and children ate it\nThey can't eat the stuff I eat it every day and I'm tired of it all the mandate it the few women and children they did they all ate it and were filled the bread of life\nThe word of God is the only thing that gives the lasting satisfaction that will satisfy the hunger of every race in every century they oh eight and were failed and know Jesus goes an important lesson\nOn using the gifts of God\nAfter they were filled that Jesus said gather up the broken pieces of nothing be lost and they gather them up and found twelve basket fools remains overruled them that it eaten he had given them the multitude a great gift\nAnd he did not want to see that gift wasted God has also given gift son to us and many of these gifts had been wasted whenever I see the great gifts to some have given by God\nAs actors singers promoters organizers and see that in many cases that gift is used for the glory of self die can help\nBut say quote are horrible waste of a God given talent take the gift you have that lay the for the La Crosse often think after over half a century of preaching the gospel what a tragedy it would have been for me personally\nIf I had never preached the sermon Jesus has given us great gifts any word the bread of life after all Jesus did say I am the living bread that came down to earth heaven he ... he does this bread show live forever so don't waste it don't waste their bread of life\nMany prefer to eat the hush the swan did eat\nBy many hours of a week with will get TV rather than the Bible they have on their home and then Rob themselves immigrate familiarity with the word of God\nIf they would only read it gather up the fragments that nothing be lost they gather the fight once and put them in baskets God's supplies to food\nBut we must provide the best get the fragments we as Christians got to eat the fried once in a basket all week long daily bar daily reading the word of God\nThe reason most people in the church are ignorant\nOf the basic contents of the Bible is because they have nothing in the basket gather up to ... months nothing be lost in revelation an angel gave John a little book and told him to eat it\nAh ...

we place are based on our trust that our hope you don't have to be afraid\nOf losing your salvation you don't have to worry about losing your salvation because we don't look for the assurance of salvation in ourselves\nBut we love to Jesus and that's why Jesus can say I give a turtle lived to them and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand\nAnd God is the one who

many people don't have that kind of person in their lives it's not surprising there's so much loneliness in America today especially among men\nVariety of reasons that\nMake that a reality there's so

other is here phone\nNear the top and you'd have to change and if you don't change some things are not going to go around between ... and as I talked to one person\nAnd they can play tennis yeah the way it looks like the okay then I stopped the other one and the first one where they looked like a ... something's wrong and they're still at odds with each other that they're not listening there just blaming and fighting against each other\nThe other way you see the same thing\nBut he also had the insight to see that's what's going on\nBetween different political parties said holy station it's the same dynamic features blaming the other but you're saying you're the top when you've got to change and hit on change with that has some serious problems here says his first inside let's say the same thing that goes on between two people that are going on\nAnd then the second thing that he did that says ... have in greater was to say All right we've got tools for helping the for us comments animals\n... for it could be any two people to cut us off in the family and wherever that any two people in Congress sounds who can actually sat listening to the other\n... and ... them and sending people to understand the other person even if they don't agree and and usually they don't agree that they can start to respect for the other one's coming from hell in that respect is restored instead of that\nThat your bag Iran that instead of looking to understand\nThat completely changes the dynamic between them\nSo that now they can satellite we honestly how can we make this list that happens with a couple of going off at each other they start to re therapists goodwill between them so they can talk about how can we are suffering the same tools and apply\nA national scale is a goal to have conversation or reached resolution on some of these issues\nThe goal is to listen and learn about the other so we can understand one another and find where do we have common ground but in that\nBut it's not where they make it very clear these guys heard over and over its not when you say when you come into one of our workshops it's not when nobody's to change their views\nAnd I try to make everybody a moderate or uh [noise] we we respect your views what we're only thing we were asking at the start is to listen to the other side with an open mind with using the tools of marital Therese you yeah\nBut if you're doing then what's the goal of that because just listening to a game show that doesn't move the needle for when you're trying to get some sort of agreement to affect\nPolicy that says very good question\nBecause on the second is that when you start understanding the other then you say south in ... so that you're open to new possibilities to find to generate\nNew resolution we'll suggest is hey so we do have common ground and that's built on that see how can we make this work\nSo that it does help people when they can come together and you got it in an antagonistic added mindset that when that understanding openness okay we have all this and common how can we work with that\nShifted you something that\nWell the way you framed the question I think reveals kind of a misunderstanding of what I was a fundamental problem in American society which is really not so much the political process illusions but the\nThe fraying social fabric where the American people are looking at one another as enemies rose adversaries\nVersus us friends and neighbors and so the way you pose the question is how does that move the needle how does that benefit will benefit is just the release intention the benefits just looking at another human being in the eyes and talking about what's most personal to you and that alone relieves a lot of attention that we're feeling\nThis was also likely that you're talking about is almost a neighborhood of community building and getting some of that back as opposed to this larger question of who gets to run the country and there was a little trailer that family I\nWon't even I have more specifically basic skills of learning and listening that I've taken for granted my whole life and that I never been taught step by step in a workshop setting how can I connect with another human being and really set aside my own you go and listen and have the humidity gauge in a respectful discussion\nEspecially if there's contention correct and you know as soon as contentious and I'd like to take it just a slightly different angle on how I got into it because for years I\nHave been raised a daughter and gone through you know it's like have political discussions with her and I sort of\nAlways took it as try to be able to say you know there's another side is ... everything isn't one sided and I always say there's another side and and I would we would get into this and for me I ran across a book\nCalled the three languages of politics by Arnold cleaning out at MIT\nAnd he made an observation at the beginning of the book but she says as a ... in political cartoon rotations or political discourse there's three goals you can have one is for your side you can try to convince your side that you're good you know what what's good about your side you can try to convince\nYour side the other side is bad\nOr you could try to convince the other side that you were site it's good if you take it a two sided thing and he said unfortunately Ninety percent of everything you see\nIn ... products that number who knows is look how bad they are\n... and you know exaggerated example of something on the other side and look how bad that is and when you're demonizing the eat each side nothing is really happening other than increasing your tribal identification if you want to use that word\nAnd for me when I saw the rangers I realize this is the antidote because the the putting two people together whenever I Would sit down and after you get someone where we can talk we're rarely as disagreeable\nAs our party identifications would indicate we you know we might assume to the one who does appeal to you margin Jeff [noise]\nLike a Democrat but also um I'd like to think public servant for a lot of years and I try to be whatever community and involved and I try to be involved as much as I can and [noise]\nYou know to my share to make it a good organization make it better I was out of school boards luckily
