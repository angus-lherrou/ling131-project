Mexican officials\nAre and he was the guy who they call them a human rights campaign or this is how lazy the media media are human rights campaigner enamel he got\nThe guy puts peoples lives in danger he has no respect for US law no respect for us immigration law and apparently his goal is to do one thing\nFlood the United states with mostly indigent low skilled workers who cannot speak English and who just want to live here and not follow our laws because if they did they'd be filling out immigration paperwork like everyone else around the country\nNo respect for Guatemala's migration for Mexican migration law and now us migration that's three countries laws they violated by doing this busting passed police officials in some cases assaulting police officials and as a scandal\nAnd by the way other elements in this a migrant mob are present us border patrol officials have reported this\nThe vast majority of these people are not criminals\nThere no terrorists and they're not even immigrants that refugees an asset nation in the United states we have to choose what kind of mission we are and treat than I was that we had a pre Josh than we can say all of them are are criminals all of them I represent that is not true so what do we have to do\nIs to listen to them you're decay says and they just sort of political asylum Ben run a\nHeat so uninformed he he refers to them as refugees a newsflash Jorge refugees under US law have to apply out of country they can apply at a port of entry so don't refer to them as refugees or not their economic migrants meaning they want to come here because it's a better place\nTree they can apply at a port of entry so don't refer to them as refugees or not their economic migrants meaning they want to come here because it's a better place to live better place to live in Honduras well yeah a lot of better places are I'm sure a lot of places are not as nice as the United states but\nThat's that's just the way it is you don't respect our laws you do not deserve to be in this country period end up story respect\nOr laws enough to apply legally and that is that we cannot be mom out by these are by these emotional extortion is no way there are a motion all terrorists these people\nAnd and I and we know what they do they did it with the separation of families they don't give a rat's you know what about the victims of illegal immigrant crime in the United states they never and by the way when these midterms are over they won't even be covering the care about the only be covering it did they think somehow this is going to help them\nHere you have the part of the United states demonizing thousands of migrants coming towards this or that effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers and refugees and so on a who many of these people were sexually qualify for that kind of sad as he is going off on these migrants are describing them as I must Thirteen or no Middle Eastern donating\nAbout Bangladeshis joined the migrant caravan in Guatemala according to Univision correspondents yesterday\nA Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said it said that people from Bangladesh had joined the mass of people trying to cross from going into Mexico Francisco Santa Ana reporting from the bridge separate in Guatemala Mexico the British have been packed with thousands of migrants\nThe Bangladeshis he said were detained in immigration facility though it's not clear what happened\nTo them after the detention they infiltrated themselves in this caravan they tried to cross with a crowd if that would've benefited them greatly but everybody everybody is here just to just to add\nTo our are already rich culture because everything's melting pot now where we really do a melting pot ask Western Europe how mass migration into Western Europe has changed Western Europe\nHas changed Germany has changed Italy it changing Sweden\nAfter European\nHow uncontrolled migration has affected their crime their way of life period eight five five forty Lara we got a lot more to get off\nThe\n\nHappier much they're really a lot\nHow did such a young man accomplished so much already where I'm just I don't know you I've never I don't think I've ever met you but uh I I'm just so excited that Illinois has a chance to actually send someone to the U.S Senate who has a sensible pragmatic view of the role of government which obviously Claire McCaskill does not have\nWell I mean that that is for church or about ... he is the way out of the ... the state which is the third by the way right next door but\nMy thing Illinois we are but I I'm just as with operating I Know slate\nI'm Sorry about that of course\nI Would work then do you do in this campaign and a word that's been the campaign our seven days a week it is but look at the bottom line is if you say is that ... goal has been in politics thirty six years so that's about as long as I've been alive she's been more than ... long years it's become a party line liberal\nI mean whether it's immigration ... during the open borders bill with diet by died or whether it's the judges you voted no on just the Kavanaugh was all or the terrible mere but her party carried out you voted no on ... Supreme Court justices that or a McCaskill isn't just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people that they voted for and that's why we're going to report\nSo right now uh this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling it a caravan of does not now that doesn't really it doesn't really capture it in my view\nA lot of people of Missouri thinking about like a crush like this on the border I mean it's a it's going to be a crush and it's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and put out for the national guard\nBut I think that the people in the earth's really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people\nFor the national guard\nThat I think that the people in Missouri really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days this yesterday every stop I made all over the state people asked me they said what is going on and they what they say it thank goodness but we have a president\nWho is strong and who was willing to take steps to defend the country like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness of this kind of threat to the country and now they have Claire McCaskill of based this threat sponsoring\nAn open borders bill I I just can't think of any war so I can think of any all week\nI Can't think of anything that's more dangerous but much better for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing he sent his highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nThe press is I mean it is a negative Durham be coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than Brock Obama was\nA how important is the president in this race for you\nTo record you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that though that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to what they want a strong America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for my state\nWhen I voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate is decades in the state of Missouri\nJob growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but its highest point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas see her wages grow but\nThere were scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all by the way throw it all in reverse reverse all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness overseas weakness on our border and that you know we just can't have that that's what this election is about\nJosh how has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill Harris her and her staff is that resonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about\nA various issues\nThough I think what's been usually resident and you know the people to take to to have a politician expressway lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face and that there's something else behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape saying that she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know these are constitutional rights\nTo belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear talk about I was to take those away from all by citizens here her staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to\nTalk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's a ... a staff was caught saying over and over and over again it's it's really the condescension the contempt\nFor everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the states who was not ashamed of our way of life in this state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh a when you look at the makeup of the Democratic party today the perpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated\nBy some of their top leaders or how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks is that on people's minds of president says mobs and not jobs and it seems like people just wanting to calm down in government to work for them\nYou know I think that's absolutely true in Missouri I've you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offering it's chaos at home and weakness to broaden this this mob behavior it it is chaos than it is ...\nAnd I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public banging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenities I mean this is not\nThe United states of America or this is not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech and harassed intimidating even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it and it's clear McCaskill you know she is she's going to ride along with it I mean she is happy to see these mob tactics employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of a\nConservative religious voters\nHave is the social\nTransformation of the country the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and ah that you know that we should really celebrate the things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious right to many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\n[laughter] you know the Missourians leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion or to churches\nTo individual you know this was something where I spent the mustard my career I've only been in politics for two years he met in the ... on I Know you do not agree on that Sarah [laughter]\nYeah yeah I've spent most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nAnd as a religious liberty lawyer and the you know the people in my state they are a fair minded people uh they uh you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the important value of safe and we believe and the importance of value a family and community and those\nThings built around faith in churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and uh I think to have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people of faith a so hostile to religious liberties just like a tall so through our Second Amendment rights just like it's become hospital the free speech what do you think about it what what the the left wing agenda really offered says ah you know you agree with us or you shut up\nAnd that is just not what the people by state law and I ... at the people in this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you I've met many reasons obviously substantive reasons when you have the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times\nIs already writing ridiculous articles about about a year off is in turmoil first of all\nIs because the New York times is already writing ridiculous articles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts and and uh and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut it's this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a lot of us just surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office I started reading this today and I was screaming laughing because it's just like they could say that about pretty much everybody knows office\nWe are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment I Love your time from the liberal state and I do I wear a badge of honor I mean you know and I by the way I'm not going out at all for taking up\nGovernment bureaucracy you know when I came to office I Would I'm the first Republican uh twenty five years\nOf the office needed to be shake it up it needed to be

migrants somehow get into a country where to find that many of them are with MS Thirteen the violence gang [noise] uh that we hear about so much he says he even said quote unquote middle Easterners or among these migrants\nThe violence gang or that we're about so much he says he even said quote unquote middle Easterners or among these migrants\nYou are listening to the Laurie from show a five five forty Laura I'm um [noise]\nDid did we have any sense of like [noise]\nWanting to use box cutters to take down planes before they did so I mean I guess we\nCould have picked up some intelligence and be you know they wanted to fly planes into buildings but we didn't really think about it\nI think it's better to just have a smart approach to law enforcement\nAnd constantly reexamine your vulnerabilities as a country given the threats that are out there [noise]\nSuitcase nuclear weapons [noise]\nRadioactive um dirty bombs or\nI mean I guess we can just take a flyer and risk it to say well we hope everybody comes into the country is going to be economically self sufficient bringing no uh you know bringing no problems with\nDiseases not be a burden that on our schools or health care I guess we could just hope for the best\nSee that's what the Democrats want they want to hope for the best that's why they're all for the most part they are either silent on what to do with this caravan they don't want to talk about it\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for that may not speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do well\nWho do you think should pay for their health care do you believe that a free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foothold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that we have to do that\nBut when is enough enough when when one is the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this caravan impart to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session audibly challenged ... not to know my comprehensive reform Bush said the ten most things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our board and a half\nAs usual Newt Gingrich is one hundred percent correct\nDo not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities oh we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean you can't enforce the border that's being crushed by fourteen thousand people at one time can't do it so what do do they mean when they say they're for border enforcement\nDo they think the asylum laws as as they exist they shouldn't be changed so anyone who lives in fear of crime and their home country should be able to come here\nOr anyone who just wants a better life should be able to come here\nNo matter what\nThat's what the standard going to be so we better get ready to double and triple our population really quickly and all that entails environmentally with infrastructure with new schools that need to be built\nA with a massive change a demographic changes to our country we better be ready\nAll that entails\nI don't think America wants to any part of that we want our country to be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by people who are informed about our history and our founding\nWho don't consider America just a place to go to get a to get a better job [noise] that's just an economic migrant we can't we cannot\nKeep our country unified at the end just as a people as a country period if that's all it becomes a place can make money [noise]\nDo you agree eight five five forty Laura is this one of the important issues on your mind don't go away\nUse ...\n\n\nIf you suffer from E D and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nA Senator Paul there needs to be significant changes made to our asylum process or to the entire system of immigration admission in the United states given what we're saying we had a thirty eight percent increase in family units crossing the border month to month\nUh in in August or September hum and see me thirty percent year over year and it was among the highest crossing right we had since ... two thousand fourteen disaster\nBecause people now if they bring a child then there'll be release because you can't keep you can't keep them longer than twenty day so there'll be released together and then they never show up so it is the Senate and now it's finally going to agree to move forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rule\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare\nAnd on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come here to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government ... and this is something that should change I'm fine with ... we can absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emitted into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nI'm Talking to Rand Paul here on the learning curve shows Senator Paul what can you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll or those two issues are are massive plus it's for the Republicans in in a tough mid term cycle cycle normally\nSo what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective [noise]\nI think the good news is overwhelming it all scared by the media you know the ... and being carried away with all the Trump ...\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pays over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows\nThe main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant manager says\nThey said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because this is what Republicans off in the Washington do get they keep calling it tax reform as the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what\nThe private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin on the side of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many Republican an amateur Democrat the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with oh you voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron sorrows and others have really fun with an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or a Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this ...\nWho was living in the United states he was a it was he he was previously kind of a sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood and he now he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize spent\nMedia had been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of his show by the Saudis is just one more ... of things that they do that are not good for America\nThey spent over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the ... around the world that teach hatred of Christianity and Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand madrassas in Pakistan supported by them the Hakani network which is a group of a bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to him that draws a funded by Saudi Arabians\nSaudi Arabians fun madrassas in Indonesia that used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam as a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of are those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind I'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the south is I'm not so sure that the Saudis are less evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen there's going to drag us into another war in the middle east\nThousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia\nBut Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war\nSo no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be hopping mad about this but what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said\nYou know they're and they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assisted American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously with Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\nYeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven weren't Iranians they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and therefore ... is that is being sent an export around the world so uh as far as arms\nThey buy some of our I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other\nSo uh as far as arms they by sort of orange sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private to enter the like which at so whatever our armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer F. sixteen is not something that\nWe could get jobs by selling F. sixteen to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it was about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis\nActually puts it I said at greater risk it increases or risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before in Syria and Iraq before that chaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nAnd Ella Jim ... who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your uh view on the ... and he said that\nI find that very surprising that some of these thousand miles away from miles away no access information are intended to this is calling the participants in the\nThis is not to say something oceans of the nation\nOr take a swing it that\nA lot too excited to be lectured by some autocrat from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial so he says oh we shouldn't presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven or like a three thousand people in your country that you have locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too\nSo I think it's pretty galling for him to western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence and say oh we need to presume the crown prince to innocent it's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince begins all the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist\nApparently many of them are hench bend the travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who they are punished but now it's been being fired\nTo chop up see or to the chopping up in the December him and other journalists and you get fired\nMy guess is they're uh they're banished met will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talked to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and this so now I'm not too excited to be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here in the ...

place in a makeshift area where they were receiving some a Red Cross a health and a publicity and thrown at us was also there it's a nicer here to say that but they the group's\nVery well connected with what's happening on the ground here and what I did have an opportunity to do with with meat and speak with all the people that were coming through mostly young men are a lot of them is Thirteen I saw as well as just a villagers farmers\nAre able bodied working men who joined it this group in Honduras as it made its way through and what I can tell you is that\nAbsolutely the information that I was getting on the ground based on what they were carrying their backpacks and everything the very well coordinated they had a coordinated message are they very\nVery few of them veered off that message because there was leadership within the group you know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I Do because you know you will catch people in the line okay move this way don't talk to the reporters right now we're moving forward\nChat this say that and I said well you told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group but the man of the head is actually telling you guys what do you know so I'm assuming if you're a leader oh no no no no we don't have any leaders we don't have any leaders I'd go up to talk to the gentleman no no we're just trying to keep moving forward\nI said well you guys have matching backpacks you had\nYou know the flag of Honduras at the front of your group nobody in the group actually looked that\nTired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the groups that they did have some bussing that people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or that a criticism use\nUh that they were coming to America to look for jobs this is about poverty so\nVery well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras uh remember there's and you know a lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically between the various a conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here\nHas been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S a elections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\n[noise] one thing that I I find to be very disturbing are the ah are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation for children and women along the way a and these are people with flatbed trucks\nOf these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan why they're doing in this in this other one in and others as you pointed out\nOn their way or if something is done to stop this will be well they're not a Sarah a group of\nThousands every week coming into our into our borders ...\nAbs yeah ... absolutely Laura this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nUh you brought up such a great point um that the women and children that were a part of these caravans of big first away and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media\nAre in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to what I'm all in officials apparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans ...\nTo try to gather information to find out what's going on here who is coordinating this they talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground a the baby was buried apparently asked by some of those leadership within the group to take the baby away and buried the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOf one of the reasons uh the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people that were coordinating this group with either manslaughter murder because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward\nAnd for the United states and our us southern border and this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups\nFor the United states and our us southern border and this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups are not just regular farm workers are people for villages\nThat are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used by these coordinator but there are some MS Thirteen gang members there's some pretty bad guys in these groups to um we know that from seeing their attached to you from talking to them while\nI was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use\nBy these organizers by these government\nAnd I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people are\nReady to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah ... there's no way to stop it at the snowball affected people will just all of Eric ... going to let us into a country and they coached them my coach them a credible fear\nCredible here this is what you need to say when you get to the border this is how you stay in America\nNow and it's just a it's just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then you're released to the piece of paper\nAnd a judge says Ryan hold women and children separately you can't keep it keep the longer the twenty days and then they're off to the races and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional status they get\n... feel like a debt of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that his ear retrieval both for Republicans in irreversible because of the sheer numbers\nYet a great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of the\nReports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegals have voted right\nUh and and there's a shift and there's a ship and if they become citizens of course there was another shift a one of the interesting things I spoke with a somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is is that for example men will take young girls\nYou know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know as as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother\nSo that they just release them into the U.S with a return to court date so we're seeing the catch and release it still on going\nOh we have men who have little girls they know they can't put them in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they kept separate them so they released them\nSo we're still seeing the same problem that we've seen for years happening right now and the president you know President Trump is it's very adamant about the fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay\nWe understand that but our borders are being overrun too so I think the most important thing we can do for\nThe United states where the ... government even in Honduras right now for the hunter in government that's working against some of the socialist a\nA aspects of their at their country of political apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any with money from us aid going to find these groups\nThat are coordinating the separate than we really need to start pulling the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people mix as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom USAID ah groups that are that are actually assist in this a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along this track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with ... with children are being uh exposed to this type of a brand new is caravan this walk be put on the back of card so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not\nI'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose doing this and what's going on\nNow well again ... follow the money someone's paying a fuel for these trucks someone's paying for the uh the food the accommodations not everybody's sleeping on the floor every night you don't you can't move this ... this number of people without an organization behind you you cannot
