Eighteen thirties so they know they're marble businessmen there\nBut not is not the most interesting fact about silicon really it's also the site of the first documented case of an object from outer space getting a person\n... where do you where do you dig these things are upset you hear and see what are they dig\nThat I liked the idea that war is eager to vote you told me ... all had to be a marvel this as a member in\nNovember of Nineteen fifty four nine pound chunk in the media right roof and the home and bounced off radio instruct misses an Hodges ... on the couch taking a nap\nAnd in fact they named the media right after Mrs Hodges in his has forever been known as the Hodges media right wow so the first documented case of someone being hit by a chunk of outer space junk and it laid out if you're up there like out here\nI think is a is a bit skeptical of no no I'm not not in the middle east but I'm just wondering if we're not going to mention another famous residents ... of of silicon wafer or a former resident of silicon not that I'm not aware\n[noise] God oh\nIs that right Jim ... or so ago wow that's great\nFor just passed on their of a few months ago and a year and a lot about his biggest state town in Hawaii that he's selling a little ... quaint a state of thinking about getting Islam is only eleven or twelve million you know and\nAnd I had it to an eye out 'cause I Love macadamia nuts so it does it but they may have grown fevers yeah [laughter] so while we would all over with that one right there but uh anyway we we really do appreciate all of our listeners and especially this week those and silica August so I'll tell you right now let's see if we can help out\nA Susan is on the line right now from South Carolina Susan welcome to the today's on a radio show\nAnd care life savers\nIs good I Hope so I Hope so here you have a kind of a mystery there which is often the case and in homes but tell us about uh what you found out\nWell and I had gone as far as I think I can find a way it's a lot and so\nThe other night out at a pet kind of and it's looking down in LA there's adult size the doors and I think all the I there's no water and there's no water there's water at the entrance of like where the doors and\nAh and I felt up underneath the ice and sweat clash and it is just copying or in a way a decorating or the shame of it I don't know what\nA what type of counter to be a hamster isn't at all [laughter]\nI used to have one of the [laughter] yeah I can pick out what she did not how it was just like flour\nAnd by that land on top with by bank I couldn't even get into the five\nPlus the climate of yeah but that's okay\nThat's okay well you know I'm of course I have a sink is something that you have to be aware of you know that sometimes you know an older counter will flex a little bit but that's okay um but the the sink definitely it's always better when a sink is installed if you um you know are able to put a ceiling they good\nUm kitchen bath type ceiling around the opening and then set the sink and that wet cook\n'em but without that is still very easy to go around the perimeter of the outside of it and it does need to be done because you know when you wash your hands or you're doing something they're a little bit of drips get here and there is going to go running behind it and a matter of fact just last week we removed a kitchen sink\nWith the countertop and so forth it uh we did a renovation for a TV show that involved putting a um an inexpensive granted in in place of it and as soon as we pulled that top off that whole thing just\nFell apart because the exact same thing just a little bit a bit of a triple borders been going into this over the years and I said it was in place they didn't know it but the minute we touched it they just fell apart at the back of the sink so the same thing could happen to the front of your saying so\nIt's pretty easy just to basically clean around that lip\nAnd you don't have to take it back out and then just pocket just like you would any um area where a fixture meat so a surface and then just a nice even be get a good quality silicone and it can be very clear or if you um ... with the basic color of your countertop is what\nI I agree model\nOkay and is the sink or white or another color okay fine I Would go with white Vanna White silicone and just put an end thin bead around and you can use a regular cooking too for that way you can get smaller ones that don't recall\nBut with white than a white silicone and just put an end thin bead around it you can use a regular cooking too for that or you can get smaller ones that don't require ... got to go around there and then just a real thin beat and then just pull your finger around it and make it nice and pretty soon\nThat will ... the water out and keep it from getting under there\nAnd uh and this is a good word for everybody that's listening here going take a look at that saying something might be happening there that you don't realize that of course you were able to be alert because you're so little water but a lot of times it's just a few drops that get in there and start rotting and you don't even know what are they\nDon't check point yeah yeah I don't worry about it\nNow I wouldn't worry about it at this point if you could go ahead and seal it up now than ah than you you you should be in pretty good shape\nAnd always wandered a cocker around that bear\nOn oil up with a new faucet generally you have a a rubber gasket there that sea water but it never hurts sometimes they don't quite do what they should do to do in a nice neat I'm Talking job around there is also a great preventative measure that you could do\nIt just always wonder that never day this is a man on the clock and clean\nAnd I just want to give you another to first of all you can use as they didn't mention either white clock to match the sink or good use pitiful green card [laughter]\n[laughter] I didn't find kind of feel good but I'm not you know there was water I'm inside to water is the little puddle was inside the cabinet when you open door not outside rides on the floor\nInside and outside\nOkay we'll probably just ... I also think the only thing I was thinking is that it might be condensation I'm drifting\nBut on and I needed her story might wash dishes outlined by dishwasher it brought it out at me and said I I'm just ... it was just I hear an average of law at all\nIt's probably licking under the sink and the most ... the most vulnerable spot is directly behind the faucet 'cause there's so little room there between the zinc and the backslash removed I just remove or remodeling our kitchen I remove the\n... plus the climate counter and back and classical eminent aback splashed in a twelve inch section the backslash was completely ride it out and we just missing it was just the ... the Formica was there but the right word behind that was gone\nSo um that's the most critically or eight o'clock is directly behind the sink between the same time and the faucet and the ... between the faucet and backslash\nGot Aaron ... [laughter] how I got it got it\nWhen I was at ... out the first day other and your stash their lap and that's all this stuff that are rich at all a mess and yeah and that's what it looked like ten years later but I I just ... too much weight or\nJust above that on on your roof the roof comes down\nRight okay for about six to eight feet high there\nSay okay that's that's a you know that there are several ways of going about this first of all you try to keep as much water away from there as you can and you know of course you be the best thing is just to build a stupor little porch area and that's a lot of work\nI'm One of the things that we found that a lot of people um found very advantageous to use a piece of rain divert or metal\nAnd you take a piece about four to five feet long which is kind of an L shaped piece of galvanized metal that you slipped right onto the edge of your shingles about six inches up from the edge\nAnd just kicked the water it just that water coming down from the roof you're kicking it away so that you minimize the amount of water that gets on the door\nUm then certainly I'm a call ... around every aspect of the door especially around top is important and then making sure that weather seal the the actual weather stripping is in good shape and when your closing the door that it connects well with it\nThen you get down to the threshold cocky in every single thing that you possibly can and does\nIt it it just kind of takes an extreme measuring close scrutiny of any little area to be able to see all that water off now another option is a lot of people will install a storm door\nWith full glass and doing that gives you another layer not only of protecting your door and providing a little more insulation value to the door but it also blocks that water from getting to the main part of the door that might leaks\nStore and providing a little more insulation value to the door but it also blocks that water from getting to the main part of the door\nThat might leak so I think those few little checklist on and you'll find that you can take care of it and if you install a new door just make sure that your seal ended up talking it extremely well as you go along and uh I think that's really the way to attack it just to go after anything that could possibly league\nAnd the rain or metal all of these things will will help you have a dry house there\nOkay thanks\n[noise] hey we're glad to help you anytime Lloyd a lot of times that's the way you have to approach those kinda things is just a ... you know and and and Joe when he's talking about things like that that is a challenge when you have that much space above the door and all that water actually heating\nThat new or so a little bit of a challenge here is like the old model ship you got to ban down the hatches as they say you just make sure you're\nOn the right side of the norm before they lash out All right you're listening to today's home on a radio really glad you are and we hope you don't go anywhere she got some of the stuff coming up with\n[noise]\nGutter brushes the easy way to keep your butter slowing near around\n... box and let's water flows were simple installation of new tools are cutting just slot them into your gutters now's the time are huge fall Samy you twenty five percent off and free shipping with Danny gonna rush of calm or call a day day three nine seven to nine more\nThree three again that code is managed to get twenty five percent all day and free shipping gutter brush dot com\n[noise] hold on your ... on your roof meal do on your deck\nThe easiest way to get rid of it all is with Winfrey it out or there's no scrubbing snow receiving and no pressure washing just spray and leave\nWith forget outdoor is non caustic and safe rainy outdoor surface just spray and you're done with letting forget outdoor get wet and forget outdoor at participating pace Walmart Anglos home improvement stores for visits west and forget dot com for a store near you\nGet your news off in the center of entertainment and the whole but it's also one of the main sources of polluted and that's why it's important to ... your kitchen for us to\nMake sure to use your kitchen range would every time you go and it keeps the who'd on for at least ten minutes after you finished cooking many ... speech or an automatic ... which can help you accomplished your ventilation hands free\nYou can learn even more at ... dot com rolling you to bring fresh ideas home\nMaybe enjoyed the project by some said him entertaining radio shed I think you'll love the projects that\nHave waiting for you at ... can you tell me ...

what's going on is a true is it a hoax well are we talking about that in just a few moments but first the phone lines are open love to hear if a man\nAnd it's one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us when you're calling in well there's Andrew ... ski and they Kevin commandos shown that Kim Andrew ... in\nTallahassee, Florida okay she first up and she she does have a tech question but I Do want to inform you or she has no power right now\nAnd shows no water right now because she was in hurricane my oh wow yeah I've been been out of power among generator they've been out of power some about when that and now they have a social service\nBut she thinks she thinks there's some trick ratio either turn it off and on and on and turn it off and turn it on some girl limiting the amount of people\nThat are all I mean you've seen the ... and there's been an aging status they I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though when you start looking at the idea that storm and where it hit how close it had it could have had to like a major metropolitan\nArea and it wasn't just twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this was a huge hurricane\nMy brother lives near Panama City\nAnd how it's going I he's doing great okay or his house survived to good um but we're all you know thinking I kept on like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you know what is your tone evacuated only two days before hand and he did in\nThe morning of the hurricane you were younger and aren't we yes um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like ... feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so ... was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about that so so if your house is twelve feet off the ground right\nSo who told me it was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about this though so if your house is twelve feet off\nThe ground right every time that you pull into your driveway you're\nGetting your steps than trying to make sure you're wearing your ... dollar\n[laughter] because you're going up and up and down a bath is in Tallahassee as Andrew said hello there ...\nI can so do you have Internet access has everything goodbye you\nWe do not have Internet oh we have spotty cell service a GOP\nAlright so without the Internet what do you miss the most\nOh my gosh I'm probably social media\nFacebook that I heard Facebook in the back row yeah\nFake I my daughter and my husband or hear what they are on it [laughter] so um yeah I I I went to make a dinner last night and I thought oh I've got the rest of your good oh wait I Can't look it up [laughter]\nSo our kids are going to have a Mac and cheese again because I can read the Bible [laughter] okay All right and then or cooking everything on the grill it that it's real interesting ... well you know that it's healthy right or you know ... you can kind of we just got a free that died out the window [laughter] oh you're in a hurricane\nAll I did was eat it was like I had the ...\n[laughter] that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts in her purse goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nUp the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speaker is once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody getting them into thing that everyone should have and I'm like well I really need one and what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because as one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean and so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic's going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and then you start moving up the actual lungs and then you say turn on the light and you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will lock\nThe lights will go and tonight mode\nAnd then suddenly on the smart speaker next to your end table some white noise is playing to to do to sleep\nIs all that happen automatically\nKnow of course not you know that [laughter] if they like you to think that but you have do you have to buy all the gadgets along the way right ... you got to buy the lights the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program those but it's not very difficult to program it\nUh they were thermostats but like the ego be and the death that work with the Amazon Echo so that this way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get you lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down to Seventy six or turn the heat up to sixty six or whatever it may be\nAnd so it takes a while for you to get indoctrinated into it so to speak or no pun intended with these smart speakers but once you once you get it I think that you'll understand\nLike this is exactly how it's supposed to work of going to put together some links for you over at commando dot com\nAnd so that this way you can select to the right Amazon Echo and also we have a couple of articles about some gadgets like I just mentioned that you might want to tie into the Alexa environment and\nThanks for the update on what's going on with you and your family are so pleased to you at everybody's came through with the just a few more pounds [laughter]\nAnd that's the extent of what happened with the

check so it's kinda like that same thing with this mobile passport and so\nWhen you get off the plane and uh when you land back in the states should look for a sign that says mobile passports here in Phoenix\nUh they actually didn't have a sign and I had to ask one of the border patrol agents like you know where's the mole passport and he's like oh that way you go I mean I went all the way to the

F. data in you're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure uh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put it in a picture up on the Internet and I pulled it down is that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera or just on Google Map\nAnd so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you if you have Google you out of school photos number one\nOr you put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is then if you go to a poor example a photo sharing site like shutter fly okay\nShutter fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you don't have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it or say once a week or once a month and so they could start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of them going to see\nIt as well [noise] okay uh so just had orders shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again there's going to be some options when you\nDo this that you really looking for your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access\nAll those photos and again\nAside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of become racist stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there're works relieve their works relief\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps and your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works we leave\nFast acting phone get their works relieve today at the end of the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their worst relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about of phones scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams are claiming to be from Amazon are totally on the rise\nIn here is how the scam works can listen up you get a voicemail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon and it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour or two maybe even as much as six\nThousand dollars a month catfish you're working from home usually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website Web store jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you're asked her to say two hundred dollar enrollment can't ten once you make the payment poof\nScammers got all your money your dream of\nTelecommuting and earning cash in your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a pain that should should set off warning belts and if you are looking for\nThe legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor of virtual assistance or maybe you want to even watch TV and take surveys yet you can make money doing that\nLive no further than the official home page I became commando show which is of course ...

back to all of your a fantastic phone calls this show\nOr the more interesting items that courage crossed my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning weak passwords that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras since thermostats routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the smart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack\nPasswords for example many routers and Web cams I have a default admin password like admitting her password so the idea is that when you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMaking something strong that the cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers and cameras All right so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nTo said leak default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is most of those Internet connected divides than just mentioned they're made in China so the new law is going to require manufacturers to say complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe to come up with a startup procedure in place that forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean\nBut how effective is really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced the hosts who knew pixel phones or because they had a major security breach\nDon't wait to hear what\nRussia my rush\nLimbaugh show weekdays of love and news talk to the\n\nAll right so we started talking about smart TV [laughter] thing that makes the TV's smart is that what it can accept to the Internet\nAll once you can make something up to the Internet guess what else can happen yeah the hackers and scammers and the bad things can go on well this past week a big security alert for certain brand of television that they had to listen they had to and they had to run down and install these for updates but the problem is that\nThey want you to install the former updates so if you don't know about this update then you're sitting there just fed them unhappy watching TV and\nActors can be doing whatever they want getting onto your TV and then onto the network so that's coming up and just a few moments but first the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once

ride out aid\nThat stupid thing and so I took me under that you would not last two weeks which would be you know to uh shows right to Kim commander shows and you'd be you'd be to buy a mile I think more and maybe seven eight shows in a row and then they disappear\nAnd then it tapered off a little bit right okay\nUm because what was happening is that I was getting like too much like like what am

this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you to be for you to do it yourself\nAll is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn\nWhat it

fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this isn't this can you know this goes up to health grades or whatever it may\nBe but the other thing too is you can have a basket their gift basket and every thirty days where you pick a winner from that gift basket okay\nSo we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left in great review for us\nRight and so and that's that can be on that little card or that can be on the printed receive\nThat could be part of the email confirmation or the tax that that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start so you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive\nYou know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make it better but you start going in you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times

give me a comeback\nFour times before they act as that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work in thirty days\nAnd want you to give me a call back and we'll
