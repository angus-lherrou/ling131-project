crawl yeah have you ever been up in that part of the world up while his that spectacular yeah and you can see why people want to live up there is just beautiful down there\nQuite a bit that that ride out to Vancouver Island can be a pretty lengthy little ride is not just above their does stay a little ... and limit ... yeah [laughter] but but once you get there you don't want to leave us it is an absolutely beautiful part of the world\nSo hey let's see if we can do a few of these emails here Joe our um this is from Paul in Georgia are range would in the kitchen does it ... to the outside St circulates through a filter is that a problem if I don't have a a and let's see is that a problem if I don't have a gas so well\nYeah you know I have a problem with the re circulating winter when did they just going to outlaw that and uh just just go in and and I don't know but anyway the fact the fact that you don't have a gas stove well that's good news but not great news because the ... just normal cooking\nIt includes some pretty bad compounds that can be pretty dangerous to your health even\nIf they're created on an electric stove wells than elation becomes even more important at this job is gas because of the themes given off as the fuel burns the best defense is a range should that bans all the way to the outside not just in the addict\nBut if you have to use it to you have to really use it to be effective to make sure that than his own Hany time to cook tapas and use it for at least\nYou know ten minutes or so afterwards and it's a good idea to run the fan when you're cleaning to make sure those themes given off by any cleaning products also a scape your indoor air we tell by the indoor air quality all the time\nAnd uh this is a great example there and and certainly are friends that were on a new tone can provide you a lot more information on cleaning up your air\nInside your house you can go to Berlin dot com or Newtown dot com to be able to pick up a little information I it just seems to be a bigger problem or the awareness of it is getting more and more um widespread with the consumers understand in that inside there can be pretty bad\nRight and that's why October's National Air quality month because you know we're moving indoors we're butting up the house were spending more time indoors and outside\nAndme or um you know adding more and more insulation putting in better windows talking on the ... and that's all great is saying the energy but meanwhile what about their that's inside\nAll that moisture all the orders from cooking and ex handling everything else that's you know the air's got to go somewhere so yeah nothing better than a really good defense and in the bathroom\nIn the kitchen and here's the key you have to use them faster on main street flipping them on they're not doing any good so uh yeah use them and make sure they that the outside and as David mentioned never does ... he's leaving the house\nLeaving the living space but not leaving the house ...\nHey here's another one from Maggie and listen to this this this town sandwich Massachusetts\nOh I Know sandwich out on the Cape ... sandwich every time we go out to northeast I Am out on the Cape cod delivered sandwich ... knows right next to mash paid it rarely here we have a little ... sandwiches\nUh mashed beef sandwich while\nAlready been well let's see [laughter]\nSo and this has nothing to do with sandwiches or turkey or um Swiss cheese or anything it's a hot day any recent remove all of our window screens but before storing them away for the winter I Would like to wash them first any tips on how to get them good and clean and ready for next spring thanks\nA thanks my husband and I love your show well thank you may we appreciate that if we can certainly provide you some great information here first of all if the screens are\nFairly small you can just use a a buy one of the inexpensive\nUm children swimming pool is one of the little tiny can he pull a little kid he pulls little molded thing they're um they put soap solution in there and so I'm a little bit\nThen struggled with a kind of assault bristle brush and then a blast off with ... you know the spray of your water hose that makes it real easy especially when you're able to ... be able to get seven or eight of them in there at one time depending on if they're wood frame or limit them for and\nThat's a great way to soak it out but Joe I recall that uh you you came up with a great idea and and it's an idea that I have used a number of times um is very simple solution to this involving or or just for short two by fours\nA yeah my oh you're talking about building yeah right just taking the two by fours\nSolution to this involving what just for short two by fours\nA yeah my oh you're talking about building yeah right just taking the two by fours and then you\nPutting that plastic rain plastic around that way you can build the frame\nTo this like if he can't get a kitty pull big enough for your ... if you have some that are more um vertical more a rectangular or we Longate it\nAnd then to be able to build that and then I mean you can use it to before usually too busy ... whatever you want to make as deep as you want to plastic I was ... nickels and dimes chair and then not caution you very much\nBut man oh man does that ever ... you know blow ... it's not going to make them as clean as as getting down into crevices of that screen and especially if you're a proactive homeowner like Maggie is here than uh than you really can make a big difference by doing that\nYeah they take forever the dry but that's the trick is to tap on you know be careful with them but after you clean 'em and you can ... the best way to describe them clean when they're sitting in the water to so people are is just with a broom like a a long handled grooming you don't have to bend over any sweet tobacco fourth flip it over sweet back and forth\nBut then tap it when you pull it out tap it to get rid of the access water 'cause a lot of his cling to screen they take forever to dry but the other simple solution I think I I shared awhile ago Danny as if they're not really dirty\nYou can only have to put them in water does use a household vacuum with a towel yeah that's right yeah usually upholstery brush you describe them scrub the frames and the screens yeah obviously have to both sides and I get off most of the dust\nAnd then he uses that like every two or three years you might only have to soak 'em and water once every four or five years to house in trouble you mean the storm\nI have mine up in that I can always put 'em in I'm big on trash bags or yeah or cardboard boxes because you know they're just adoptive just leave him say around but somebody who is your options either use water don't use what I Would start with just a vacuum in if those seem\nCome if they come out clean then you know then you can just storm way dry as they are\nYeah that's a great proactive way of taking care of in a lot of areas of the country are doing just like Maggie is doing that they know they you know it's getting colder in some areas of the country you know you're not going to be able to open those windows are very much anymore to allow that fresh air to blow through so\nGo ahead and use it as an opportunity to remove the screens to keep them from being damage\nOr an certainly eating dirtier in that way it's nice and clean and ready to put them back on when spring rolls around and want to remind you of the ...

about from\nHelp out a Tom is in Medina, Ohio I have been done a number of times a Tom says we're installing a subway towel back splashing our kitchen I read that the first row of the towels must be level however my existing countertop a ten foot long and the slope five sixteenth ... from the left to right and\nI hate when that happens a do or maintain the slope or do I have to draw a level on the bottom and start from there I'm there for the ... route hum gap at the bottom where the towel maids to grant it will be one sixteenth on one side ... on the right what do you suggest well I'm\nJoe you know you you've you've written a towel book so you you know you're the you know fancy expert on all of this but I'm just a few things to consider first of all you can't lay the towel crooked it has to be level\nAnd so you when you have these situations you're looking for the the the the way that you can do it with least with it being a Middle East obvious that it is an level and of course if you could fix the countertop that's great what's best approach to this you think\nWell I'm seeing is email and he says that ... ten foot long and its slopes five six tenths of an inch and you're right you don't want some leaders setting your tiles especially subway tiles with all all those vertical all those horizontal lines being way outta level but\nIn my experience you're never gonna see five sixty seven inch over ten feet you're just not going to see it I Would say set the tile right on the countertop and just follow it\nAnd make your cuts all the cuts that will be because otherwise you're going to be cutting tile and that's gonna be noticeable in that first course and all the ...\nYou're cuts all the cuts that will be because otherwise you're going to be cutting tile and that's gonna be noticeable and that first course and all the ... tiles that will be out of\nOut of level so to speak will be hidden underneath the cabinet and he mentioned that is a backup one saying where a\nTom mentioned setting the grout on setting the ... on the bottom you don't want to set put grout under that tall with their talent tile meat to counter top right silicon yeah 'cause those two materials are gonna move separately so\nNow where we have dial meeting something else you know another material um you what you might silicon there and go but I Would set it right on top of that first

are being used to house any type of pirated material\nOr the never heard of ...\nAll right uh because that's a lot of data fifty gigs than a day I mean that's huge ah so\n... more than once and you feel well yes that's what I was thinking that maybe\nA because what sometimes with the the hackers do is that they find vulnerable computer than they house files are there and then they tell everybody to go access the files on your computer or so that this way they're not liable or you know they make and it's harder for them to be tracked okay to be tracked down [noise]\nUh so I Would definitely go

have you lived in into that\nYou know get media access control or what that means is that the\nOnly devices that are going to have access to your route or those devices that you permission okay

'cause my iPhone is just about rock sitting in my pocket thinking of the phone when's the last time you use the pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore or\nI saw them in Great Britain\nOkay summer you know I I've been a long time\nAnd so I was standing there it's actually quite funny as I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booths were inside there's a pay\nPhone and were you on your phone you know and I was just stand there like in towards like Hi okay and and\nPlus out laughing and I said what are you laughing at okay behind me there were all these naked women painting like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers or anything he found a use for the phone booths exactly which is also the phone book\nBut it isn't that something that's crazy yeah the phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change and now we just fast forward and when when the iPhone come out and years ago two thousand seven\nThat was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone okay did you have an Atari twenty seven hundred yeah\nHow we are we're all generations video games game boys yes how to game boy how they say go CD again this generation that only anything about that no cars on their parents' phone if they don't know anything about a road atlas\nLike a map map yeah now now that that's good right yeah\nOkay I've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm going to try now\nOkay America Online now you know I started the computer section at AOL years and years and years ago to remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disc play out of the cereal box that you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes as that and I ... I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says we'll find out Tuesday [laughter]\nIs that with AOL is that if you gave a desk sometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person use that is that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while\nI mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was in banking like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL biscuit yeah just how are you getting them in people's hands just standing on a corner chopping them up and people\nYou know like I spend the time [laughter] no I was I Would put him in like because I have\nThe computer tutor videotapes oh okay I put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign him do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened\nIs that so uh you know so I'm like I started the computers to actually get this whole AOL thing going on\nAnd then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I hadn't gotten and it's all numbers I've gotten like a check for twenty five grand for that you're not just by people using the disk you hand if that was the desk and then taken using the computer section okay and I I that I managed I mean this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us that's a bit different in a different character I said well that's going to really work for me [laughter] okay [laughter] and so that was when\nUsing key word commando instead of going to AOL that I knew we negotiate I negotiate that it would go to commanded outcome\nBut that was when using key word commando instead of going to AOL that I knew we negotiate I negotiate that it would go to a commander to come back from you on the website but that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon the company\nFor the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that we're speaking of one last one can you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] but wouldn't that anyway [laughter] yeah one on one hand shakes think all the handshaking no garbled [laughter] yes\nI mean it was so bad that you know sometimes we go away and and where there'd be no Internet or anything and I like walking around making that sound like you know they did they do that intentionally\nYes they wanted it to sound like a newly wanted people to know that that was connecting because previous to that and did not make us out\nIf you want to listen to a fascinating pod cast and then we had to go to a break a fascinating time have said no I but I just uh I I was

by news talk Fifteen forty two yeah here again is just time\nAlready made the dry humor goal Millan all yesterday the voice of\nThe Panthers Gary ... by the studio to talk about today's game\nYou look at what the Panthers have done really even back\nTo the the last to North Dakota state where ... the Panthers led the number one ranked team in the country ... thirty one twenty eight ended up losing that game but then went to South Dakota was ranked twenty fourth in the country at the time and the Panthers beat them look\nGood doing it you come home he beat the number two ranked team in the country twenty four to nine it just this team's got a lot of confidence a lot of momentum right now behind them or the ... just playing I I think some really solid football in the deep as has been absolutely outstanding so\nI think you go into that game Saturday against western Illinois confident team a team that that has\nMomentum but you can stumble you you can't give anything back after you beat a couple of top twenty five rank teams you don't want\nTo take a step back and get knocked off by this Leatherneck team and and you just have to look back to last year when western Illinois came into the unique dome and beat you and I thirty eight to twenty nine and there's a lot of the same guys\nThat are back on this Leatherneck football team this year including their quarterback Sean Maguire\nI thirty eight to twenty nine and there's a lot of the same guys that are back on this Leatherneck football team this year including their quarterback Sean Maguire and an excellent running backing Steve Mix Shane they return or have seven seniors in the starting lineup defensively [noise] this\nIs a good western Illinois team that's got a lot to play for two\nAnd again as you note you need look no further than last year to see a stumble when western came to town so you can't take anybody in this conference lightly but certainly not these guys because they prove they can take it to you on your home field\nAt ... and Jeff this'll be I think the thirteenth time that I've gone to McCollum Illinois in my twenty five years to broadcast un I football against western Illinois and we won some games there\nI just can't ever remember is going there and just\nJust playing the lights out and blowing them out it's always been a tough game\nA just a lot of factors that the team doesn't always stay right in the city they stay usually in the quad cities or or maybe Galesburg and then they drive in the day of the game not always that huge crowd there that the teams locker room is a ways away from the field is just\nThey're just a lot of things that it it just it's always been a tough game and part of it is they have good teams they have good players and they were they've been in the playoffs including a year ago but a lot of\nThings that get you off your game and on your schedule and off your routine\nAnd that that's just dead and coach Farley new staff has begun routine they they like things you know so this has never been an easy game I guess is what I'm trying to say we've gone there was great teams and the games were closed we've lost games there that this will be a tough game on Saturday I just no doubt about it\nSo if we look at individual match ups you already talked about what the answers are doing well you identified some of the standouts were the leather next but in the matchup game water some things we should really be looking for early on to see if this was going to be a good ride home\nAt well first of all I Love the way the defense is playing holding that South Dakota state team did nine points was incredible a team that came in averaging forty eight points a game you know in in the first six games but against western Illinois our defenses I think has to be really good again Sean Maguire\nWas the second team all pre season and the FCC quarterback and you're talking about quarterbacks like east and stick in Austin Simmons and guys like that that didn't get that on her a tear in Christian the quarterback a week ago we faced was the pre season first team\nQuarterback this kid McGuire was second team are still really really tough quarterback Steve ... an excellent\nRunning back he's also a tremendous returned man in their return game uh I I just think our defense again is going to have to play tremendous football to get this road and I think are often will be fine I think we'll find a way to score some points will move the ball\nStart to gain traction outside of Iowa and um we are very excited about that possibility ten years down the road\nUm where do you know that our education department has a very good connection with their lungs um we just want to make sure that people understand that um we really just want to show appreciation and an elevated at a department and in that area of of of a profession\nI'm In our goal is is again like I mentioned just to continue this for\nHowever long or you know northern Iowa exists in it and it'll be forever and so for us it's um how can we make sure that they feel loved and appreciated and come back to campus for a game and and really just enjoy game day\nAnd again it it it's all about them and we just want them to to understand that um we know where our pastors in where we want our future to be in and they're going to always be a part of it\nIt's always nice to be recognized of course in teachers don't often get that from their students but for a select few in this program elevating educators that recognition will come\nWe've named um three educators of the game so far this season for football\nAnd all and all three of them were absolutely honored to have that\nUh um to be named educator the game they were very happy to be recognized for their hard work and I think that's also teachers sometimes they don't have that type of recognition at times and so for us just to to pick one individual out and bring 'em back to a game and recognize them as a big deal\nIn the registration um that we've received for the elevating educators game a lot of positive comments a lot of comments that are saying this is\nVery awesome to see we we are appreciating that ah you took the time out to recognize us and ultimately that's exactly what we want we want people to to understand that we're working for them and and want them to have\nYou took the time out to recognize us and ultimately that's exactly what we want we want people to to understand that we're working for them and and want them to have a great day we will be recognizing the individual and every men's basketball game as well\nAnd so it it's just been a good um it's a good start for us we we know where it's going to go but it's been a great start\nOur these awards the educator of the game shows\nWe have a a group of individuals on campus and the education department that are kind of compiling some some nominations essentially\nThey're the best to pack them because they understand that field they know what it takes they know um they have the connections you know they know where people have been an encounter the track that people have gotten to 'em and so it's it's good for us because that's not our world and so it's been good for\nA for them to kind of take rain on that\nAnd we know that it's done well because they have a high standards just like University of northern Iowa does when it comes educators um and it's the exact same thing with our scared of the game and it's it's been a really good way to start the season for more information um everything's on our website right now are you not Panthers dot com slash elevating educators\nUm maybe on the lookout we are going to be selecting a men's and women's basketball date as well um to recognize a educators as well just like this November seventeenth game and so\nKeep it out we we should be announcing that fairly soon\nWe're un I canvass spotlight I'm Mark Morris\nYou can earmark Morris's campus

fought basketball game [noise] um and they ah they were able to sneak it out and get to the semis and of course went on to win our tournament and as you just mentioned and went on to do some tremendous things in this tournament [noise]\nUm [noise] so fun to a on that level of fun to see them have that kind of success um [noise] when you know you were just in a game with them that could have finished either way um [noise]\nAnd then also you know a lot of motivation and that you know for for our guys that played in that game I'm understanding that you know it it may have swung on a three possession deal maybe that was midway through the first half maybe it was at the end of the first half\nMaybe as midway through the second half um we had a shot to tie it late in the game but there was probably a three possession swing somewhere in that basketball game because for the most part that game was on one possession game\nUm we had a shot to tie late in the game but there was probably a three possessions swing somewhere in that basketball game because for the most part that game was on one possession game for forty minutes yeah they may have been one or two times either team got ahead by more than a possession but [noise]\nUm so our guys understand and then there's some motivation as you head into the off season uh for our players to get better and I understand that we're going to be in those games again in what is what does it take to um get past the team like oil so you can move on in your conference tournament a and then the other side of the gym I\nYou know since we've been in the NCAA tournament of a handful of times and we've been to the sweet sixteen um we've talked since two thousand ten about putting together a team that can advance to the final four and\nSo we've been staring at that thing for a long time and in a I'm On the other side of it to ... to see someone else do it and you're on the lake is a there's a lot of motivation and that um you know we would like to be a team that's a that's in that same position\nThat tournament at Kansas State is going to be ranked in the top ten in the country there on our side of the brackets for the winter of our game against ban will play Kansas State or the other side you've got you've got some very good teams as well so\nEither us or ... whoever wins the quarter final game was going to get three really good games than a um [noise] so that tournament is going to read in the big four via an opportunity to play against Iowa one more time I'm In Des Moines in a um they've got a good team back they've got almost everybody back on their teams when they're um ah they've got a good group\n... it's it's a good schedule it's just you know this year to most more of the games are neutral site and wrote games last year we had a tremendous home schedule in a with you and I will be in Texas Arlington there's some good teams that came in here\nIn addition to some of the things we did away from home so um it is it's a very good schedule again um we've got a couple of home games right before Christmas with Grand Canyon who is um you know dam Marley coaching them and they've come a long ways in a short amount of time\nAnd they feel like they've got an NCAA tournament team that just missed it a year ago now I Know he feels great about his roster that he's got so that home game\nUm later December against Grand Canyon is is a team that people are going to want to come and see ... and they were playing the University of North Dakota with played them enough and people are familiar enough with them so we've got two really good home games right before Christmas [noise] um [noise] and then of course the the valley schedule\nAnd of course the fighting hawks are your alma mater I don't know if you're calling them that but uh is is that uh again that's still sentimental for you even after Thirteen Years that you and I\nYou know we fight each other enough now where um it it will still always be an hour and a little bit different than the other games the because of the um the connections of course that I've got to\nDo my teammates and it might go up there in our time up there I'm the first game was was very different in a lot of ways um hard to play that first game\nBut we've played each other you know enough times now that it's a it's closer to just another game\nYou alluded to some of the teams earlier that uh will be strong again in the valley I guess I'd be interested if they're earning nuances and schedule if there's a particular\nStretch of games or whether that's road games or whether that's just a sequence of opponents that that you're seeing one after the other that you think's going to be either a critically important or particularly challenging by the time the Panthers get into the valley\nYeah you know I I think a couple of things one ... the way we start is with three of the four that we talked about in those for being the most experienced returning teams in our league and and they've got great rosters I mean it is for good basketball teams and we start with three of them\nOn the road at Bradley homeless southern Illinois and then turn around and go right back to the Illinois state if I've got to correct and and uh\nSo two or three on the road all three of them are teams that I'm that return a really good rosters so that start is uh we're we're going to jump right into it you know we're going to have some new guys ideas of freshmen and big he is a junior college transfer and ... as a\nTransfer from Pepperdine and you know guys that haven't seen our league yet I'm going to get it or it's going to come fast and furious but those three basketball teams and\nThen on the other thing that I was out and you know I mentioned the four but ... the league is hard um and I and I think it's that way no matter what sport you're planning to matter what league you play in\nThe league play as hard in that hurt us last year we we started on five and league play we get beat fifty six fifty two and fifty six fifty an hour to home games\nIt is hard in that hurt us last year we we started on five and league play we get beat fifty six fifty two and fifty six fifty dinner to home games\nUm there were a double figures in the second half in one of the road games in you know you should score and more than fifty two should school more than fifty on your own court if you give up fifty six on your own floor you should windows games and [noise]\nUm ... place are the older guys guys that have been through league play and again I don't I don't care what your plan and that and I don't care what sport it is a\nIs so we're gonna we're gonna be playing against the three teams that I you know that we talked about early um but then when you get done with that it's gonna be say Indiana State or ... teams out double returns a bunch of guys Indiana State I Know he feels really good about his roster even though they're not as experienced as the former we've talked about\nIt it just doesn't get a lot easier when you get into league point and I'm so that ah I'm looking forward to that challenge with our guys as I mentioned about our group\nWe like our Oscar a lot uh we've just got there we we've got a lot to learn in a lot of ground to cover between now and then\nGo will certainly be looking forward to it thanks so much yep thank

Hayden helped assure that match would be asked to cedar valley soccer complex Hayden's teen leading six goal of the season was the match winter Thursday in Illinois state and that helped the Panthers ramp up the third seat in the NBC tournament\nRecently I talked to Hayden and after another strong un I soccer regular season I asked her if some of the older players on this team and some of her graduated former teammates help to remind the current squad the times of not always been this good for the program\nYeah specifically the seniors this year ah we had a super good season last year and a record breaking season for our program and we got to that championship\nOf the NBC tournament and I think that just shows them how much potential our team has this year especially with returning so many of the seniors so that just gives us an extra little punch going into the tournament and gives us hope that we are good enough to get to give me a tip again this year and hopefully make out a way to the NCAA tournament\nWhat is it about this team over the last couple of years that has clicked so well why do you think that ah the Panthers had success recently when they hadn't in the past\nUm I think one reason that this team I've had so much success is just how loud that we get along as a grilled the on and off the field\nUm we never have any fighting or anything in or all best friends off the field so I think we'll look at games and practice as being like our friends and that just makes\nComing to practice more enjoyable and we're also playing for the girl next to last night just ourselves I think that gets a little extra motivation to do our best in every practice in game", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "27"}
