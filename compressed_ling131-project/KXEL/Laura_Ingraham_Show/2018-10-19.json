he's talking about moms and we didn't know anything about ... and suddenly\n[noise]\n\nFrame of the royal sitting in to Laurie from I mean\nJohn Berman also took this long I Want to see this resonates with you at all you see I I think well I Will share my theory with you in a moment this is John Burma reacting to the same by you just heard President Trump saying I loved when this guy mark who's running for Congress in I'm In Montana [noise]\nAh I Love the body slam that reporter and yeah he was charged your body so I guess a reporter came up to them was abused will be full body slammed my thought Trump was tickled\nBy it and said Joe on the stump John Berman said there's\nNothing like making a joke out of body slamming or a foreigner one another journalist was dismembered his fingers cut off three weeks ago and the administration has been dealing with that damage control and trying to provide cover for the Saudis frankly that very day\nAnd that night the president's impulses to joke about an unprovoked attack on a reporter sent Jacobs by the Scottish\n... he's talking about Greg ... a ... year GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana um ... does is Walsh with you\nThere's this negate the mobs somehow out there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows and teeth a black hole a explosion of violence in hate we're sitting\nDoes the congressmen in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were say by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump side comment on I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Lesley Stahl which we we decompose the or doors a demystify that interview written decompose we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show\nAnd Leslie stall unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when ... when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another\nThe public utterly turns them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look because they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term or will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think clip what move do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nTo me to the polls is that the Democrats are equally or be this march and drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for this\nOr be this march and drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for their parents range who's paying to treat them coming north and you're going to find those Democrats and then publish it and that will change\n... you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly a an ecosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan\nIndividuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only the Caribbean but more\nI I don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as ah the Catholic migration refugees services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies\nYou see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers serve emptied\nSo they've material financial interest in this\nAnd it's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way\nApart from the Caribbean we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you and they can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names are releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan clip thank you very much for the call or will also share some other uh reports with you hear how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for lore Ingram we're right back stay there\n\n\n\nUsed to receive forty a actually a\n\n\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nWith this economy which we're going to get into later I mean I you know I think sometimes Americans get swept up in the emotional moment or the headline in the moment and they forget\nThe government and presidents have very limited powers and purposes and it really is to ensure mostly our security and then to give us a playing field where we can rest opportunities\nAnd uh and and grow into prosperity as a as a country that's the primary jobs\nAnd when we start looking to the side issues or whether it be you know a a Trump said something you know saluted a guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis cutting of a journalist to ribbon\nYour thought on that the emotional play that the Democrats are trying to use in the midterms might that be effective given the difficult tenth out there\nWell I think my ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape on employment under four percent\nBut when the economy is good\nThe economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue [noise] uh and I think that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... and the the murder of him and this tremendously alert tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey I think too\nYou know there are they ... they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but it was or what exactly frame and is the Democratic party's grade attend or what is their contract with America what are they going to do more pretend they're going to do since they only they can get I Believe is\nThe one house of representatives what is ...\nBack with America what are they going to do more than they are going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign as Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and I'm ... now you're seeing some pollster saying by internal polls are the president's approval ratings are surging\nAnd that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look\nLike paternal [laughter] uncharted hell [laughter] noted verification as far as I can\nSay anything that can enact anything they can't you know we revise Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate\nThen sent it down to President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that have got to get the Boulder report\nW looking into alleged you know alleged of obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you're wondering if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach crop and lock him up\nBut you know I hadn't announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives\nTo the degree that your rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue you don't get the broad based sort of the ballot then you look over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\nAnd I want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to ... three games a beta Rourke um who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say\nThat and you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach have you changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime the trees in primary primary or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president had committed\nI wouldn't like in the impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and then make the best informed decision and the interest of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the\nGun it still didn't hear the charge\nWas she exactly hear that [laughter]\nDoes that help it doesn't help better over there was a man and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten voyage down with sixty two million in the background but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think\nWe're better off work it seems to me is running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in Harlem for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race and Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency in Eighteen searching\nYeah well aside from high to there's very little commonality there that I think you I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chap ah you'll find a laundromat put him in a corner you put you on the record year\nDo you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the people out there who elected Trump\nI think the I think overall that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take the house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've got to lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations all the rest [laughter] but I don't I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nMhm have you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK you take it easy Randy you fat and er into\nOld you are listening what is driving new to the polls this

deliver\nDonald Trump is the opposite he's impressive and fun engaging and I have to admit I've said this a thousand times on the show when Donald Trump first showed up and said I'm going to be president I thought oh my gosh you're kidding me you're kidding me right\nI mean I that was my first impression then when I saw him then when I saw the crowds in Virginia we gotta we went out in the

I think there are some industries lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I I ... and here's the thing that I Would say and you're right\nNow is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already underway\nUh we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment\nBut the same time Steve there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effect of this and need to know that the a he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't fix everybody every aspect of every life [noise]\nThe only things as I mentioned to Pat Buchanan the two things that that people want from a precedent\nOur security and prosperity\nAnd prosperity is best gained by having an even playing field where you're not owners sleep taxed or regulated out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about and I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited he's powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and everybody else I mean why are we focusing on\nA journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post ah but\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia they were rogue regimes all over the damn morals Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell you they don't they don't you're talking about due process\nNo due process their due process is well let's see what side do you want to be roasted all well and from\nUnderstanding as well as the the journalist wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but yeah he's our domestic Saudi Arabia to politics problems I Know it would be best advised the U.S does not have any interest in mowing and these are massive\nOut well as it turned me that it's beyond the president's ah of the capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but ah the media I can prove it to\nMSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalist or that may have been mutilated dismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't\nBut we can only call them out MSNBC and CNN lead with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in the short and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy with presidency in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so to push that narrative\nAnd it doesn't affect our policy with presidents the in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so\nTo push that narrative and to drive it to try to hit Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we're going to take a quick break when we return all of your calls what's driving you to the polls\nEight five five forty Laura Raymond ... sitting in the lower ... we had lots of cultural needs to share with you soon I'm On Twitter at ... she said Ingram angle and be sure to watch the anger mangled tonight ten pm eastern live Trump rally from ...

Irish college football it rarely saw well you're the fighting Irish and we're the pansies that they have little violets divide\nFighting Irish and we're the pansies I think they have little violets divide the bobcat but I think they were they had bobcat but all the all the posters at NYU there were all these little these little violence ... violence so we we drove recently called them the pansies anyway um tell me where we stand in these midterms mad\nAbout when you look at the polling data the real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does have a great question um you know basically that's air ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points uh CNN and had a poll\nTen days ago or ... or so that show that that why so what you're seeing is that\nIt almost all the polling that they are now that's a that's a common trend that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because there aren't a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling it a lot of people who aren't at work\nWhich don't tend to be Republicans a and and as you get close to election they got a better idea of actually going to vote or wherever rabid in mid term it's like you know roughly ... percent of the people vote so determined he actually got to vote if that's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll that has Democrats up three in a toss up\nDistrict now if you're only up three and a toss up districts that's within the margin of error and in the Trump total era I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right I\nWas in Florida for a speech this week I had a woman came up to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed as a clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to do I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the angry ... treatment of capping off I'm voting for the first time it it it it ... this is this this is the silent vote are not going to get picked up in these polls I think it's absolutely a dynamic that Eighteen\nSimilar to how it was it two thousand six teams there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own party\nYou know a Gallup poll came out and said fifty seven percent of Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party is shifting becoming much more radicalized that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that um you know the the the whole question about electing socialists\nPeople like or cause you Cortez et cetera uh it's really wake you a lot of people at a normal folks in the country to say maybe I'll vote\nYeah and I I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night\nAttacking a of of a statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old and when you see people yeah quite mental that's what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to you in Florida mad I thought she was going accused you of being a war criminal um you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people\nThat's a big turnoff in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge journal tell me about the Trump effect he\nIs he is stumping all over the country including\nIn Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox um what is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like Kavanaugh end its historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country this aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's nationalize that it can the era of trumps\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about chocolate Republican to run from it because they don't like a portion of what he does or making a mistake\nOf voters that difference that down so it was a one accounting guy they don't think that every Republicans Trump they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are\nAuthenticity is on the rise of politics and that's a good thing\nWell here's the is the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't\nCompete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um what are your concerns them at should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're going to start persecuting people like my wife worked for Donald Trump they're going to go after every White House staffer they can\nThey're going to try to bring people down to their age this whole idea of the ... and ... that take it over the Democratic party will turn to dabble in power in the house and it'll all be about trying to get air quotes corruption Trump corruption and\nEverybody that associates themselves with Trump they're going to try the same strategy Hillary try which Donald Trump his agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our wits end already I dont know what's gonna happen if the Democrats just as bad which they will have to choose because it's just that there is no which at the other than stopped Trump that is the agenda\nWhat it what is your got tell you Matt where does this end ... what do you think happens\nI got tells me that we're going to have a fantastic night the Senate I keep saying to be picked up in the Senate from fifty one I actually it could be higher than that I actually think many of these races like Claire McCaskill even Montana\nWest Virginia which um answer I think the Democrats are totally vulnerable I think the Republicans have a great chance at picking up the seat [laughter]\nI think in the house of the coin flip\n'em I think I think Republicans don't have a chance to hold onto the house to be more\n\nAttention you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lowered costs dramatically you may be significantly overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings\nDoes not permit order\nAnd promotes chaos that was at the heart of what he ran on so this cuts\nI think uh his way as these midterms heat up and they get they are very close now most of the polling still shows democratic victory in the house but there is a path\nFor the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary it's very rare for president after his first you know in the middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political pendulum but\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say about\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see Feinstein and Schumer\nI'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths and I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that as a swath of America\n... were in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody but we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia when we lived here frankly\nYou know there are parts of places you you you know I I ... you could go and never see a black person never see Hispanic face in some of these restaurants\n... it ... ... northern Virginia for whatever reason it carbs up that way it it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided live separate life not in New Orleans we're side by side we share a music we share food we enjoy each other's company would drink together we have fun together Mardi Gras
