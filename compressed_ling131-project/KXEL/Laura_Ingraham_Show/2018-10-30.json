conservative Israeli writer and a political ferret Faris and his point is that\nNationalism as properly understood this post World war two or twenty first century nationalism is merely stating that country's deserve to have\nTheir focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist little gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe in the Japanese culture that there's something unique and beautiful about it\nAnd they're not constantly passing judgment on others but for Japan they want to preserve their history their culture their language all those things that they think make Japan's special\nAnd I think for Trump and and this applies to other countries as well but for ... the same thing for him what makes our ...\nMake Japan special and\nI think for Trump and and the supplies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nAnd

the word nationalist\nAnd explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with that but at the Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the laugh they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second migrant migrant caravan has entered Mexico according to Fox is just broke paleo so Trump can't talk about

interview I've ever seen the president thank you nice job last night you hit all the points it must have been very exciting for you to be in front of a bank us today but\nI I have to tell you that this is a show this is a another thing from the left they knew this was coming these people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it\nAnd the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it and I wish she'd signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the leftist completely botched and some Republicans have totally botched is well we've been talking about this issue for almost Twenty years oh All right well we need to all your calls a congressman Dave Brat is also going to join us he's in the fight of his political life I remember\nBrat came onto the scene when he unseated Eric Cantor now this was back in a twenty fourteen and now he's up against a far left a woman who ah think

the economy moving forward on immigration my opponent has said you know she's or\nA open borders but ... cities even worse and he won't come out and say that directly but she says let the local law enforcement deal with it you know the caravan\nThe catch and release the let local law enforcement she comes from federal law enforcement and doesn't know the basic provisions of the constitution for federal law enforcement\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law as I said if\nI were just going to make it up as we go and that that is a very dangerous new direction or that the Americans want to move in that direction and so we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist healthcare pitched ending Medicare is you know it\nDouble tax rates personal and corporate\nThat puts you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction that it it's just like you said it forward backwards\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and\nI Would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and forests then here for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean it's most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this\nIt is they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you are way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the left so want\nThey want they want is kind of take those issues away and I neutralized tromp on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] [noise] yeah and that won't work immigration you know Seventy to eighty per se that issue the Democrats are being told not to mention it right by all the\nOdds are that article in the daily yesterday the Democrats you know just just sarcastically\nCaving on these issues and just saying that well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why start out there that cynical they know they have not offered up a platform on any issues and immigration is I think the issue especially in my district and so yeah you're right that the kids were loading up with Twenty one trillion in debt\nAnd then catch and release these are all children have got to cross the border right like the fat which are good people in there but there are the people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill rights and you run those basic issues by the by the taxpayer\nAnd by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation or the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you know do grow the economy I taught college for Twenty years last the Obama\nPeriod a high end college graduates couldn't go out by the decent job\nNow it it's just a day and night they big time is just boom and the kids are getting multiple job offers wants to just it was really interesting it's just the job mobility people are leaving their jobs because they're not confident than go get a better job that's been a long time since that's happened and so\nUh the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know ... ... it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody\nBut there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offer a result\nThey want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted best occasions they want to page the president impeach cabin all my opponent won't come down on\nAny of that of course not so what is she in fact I mean you know the question out asking final final days why\nWhy is she hiding why\nWhy is that why is your challenger\nMitt spanberger hiding on these key issues that need the voters in Virginia and deserve to know the truth about what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state the the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers Virginia\nBut she's answering these glib\nCliches in Broome eyes to make us air every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions and why she hiding I Would keep saying that we're issue why she hiding\nRight ... one of the things she tired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press a let her high but sure where I worked at a a Saudi a school she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is a U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel because\nA anti Semitic anti American anti woman\nThere was a far right ... hobby fundamentalists Saudi training school that produced terrorists\nAnd after the fact she says she still proud that she worked there but like you said if you're proud of the fact that you worked at this school that is they hate school then why didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she tidy or policy platform she's\nHiding her position on healthcare immigration taxes she won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the seventh district in Virginia\nI Want to play a ... I Want to play a sound bite pretty this is from Joe Lockhart Clinton's old press secretary again words in subjects that they want to take off the table before this midterm vote let's listen\nHe's still talking about global is um which is a dog whistle for a for a semi they still going after George Soros another dog was over anti Semite Donald Trump doesn't change um he might have moments where he reads the paper in front of him but he will change I mean if if\nIf the largest slaughter of American Jews in American history won't change his attitude and his rhetoric nothing will\nWell I got it\nYeah it it it sounds different from Joe ... someone who was on CNN with Allison camera on a\nAh but I don't think that was ... I mean that's the sense that you can't say the word global list ... why not I mean that the lessons use the word global is plenty of times but again they are the ... story is one day and they want to take the college speech code mentality\nIn voice it upon society at large in that way they fix all the debates\nYeah the the left is very good and this goes back decades right they are training but you'll stay try to take your strength away from you\nTake away your strongest point my strongest point is Iran as an outsider er I've voted that way right my small business score is a hundred percent\nAnd uh I have the support of all the small business folks across my district et cetera I get around all the county\nAnd so they're taught to talking points for me is I don't get around and not being paid off by big pharma cetera but because of an Obamacare vote and so\nYou're you're right that talking point is right they're very smart on how to shift the language they do not want to have a policy debate if your policy debate would win it Ninety ten they have to shifted off to the politics of personal destruction they have a hard time with me 'cause I went to seminary that no I Love everybody\nAnd so they have a hard time shifting around that way on me and so now they're just running crazy false commercials that you know the biggest thing I Can't believe with a national media it it it's it's just ... the house voted for pre existing conditions ripe to help people with preexisting conditions\nIt passed the house and that's the number one issue the leftist running on saying we're against it after that was the biggest bill of the year last year but you can't cut through no not dream fake news\nNow well Dave Brat a is a is a classic independent thinking Virginia and

require a what the left claims that requires\nA it's it's open to debate it's a fascinating subject\nAre joining us now Mark Krikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up a yesterday\nAnd the media there have loving response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle once again\nYeah well I mean that's to be expected quite frankly but uh the president is a I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nA clause within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists\nOr fallen students are illegal aliens that phrase a it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it\nNever been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue for the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue\nIt's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nUm our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to have a constitutional amendment or something but it but the only way to get this process even started\nIs for the president to do this to issue an executive order and what it'll mean is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue ACLU will find one of them they'll sue nobody lawsuit that's this is\nUm you know whenever you think about this issue ... whatever you think the policy should be\nThis is the smart way to keep up the issue so we can move it along\nIn the process of you know public debate because all we're doing now is saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight men X. and somebody says no this other senator and Eighteen sixty eight meant why one the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the present\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians and Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from

his working if uh you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working on retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this\nNone of which is in the interest of the United states\nNow it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the

know it's going to be a red wave and it's gonna be big it's going to shock everybody people aren't going to be starting just like they weren't two years ago I said okay well I Hope you're right but let me let me give you some facts on the ground\nForty oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship is it just a second here but I Want to set it up with this 'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth row if this is exactly why Trump was elected as my good friend McCarthy and the recording said you've got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is the site itself the day the NBC is headlined Trump concept tack on birthright citizenship is just the latest attempt to rile up the GOP\nBased everybody's saying he can't do that that's the fourteenth amendment he can't universe away with an executive order reverse the fourteenth the men do we want to discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activists judges that'll that'll turned him down here but the point is\nThat you need somebody like Donald Trump miserable the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended to grant citizenship\nTo slaves and their descendants\nNow how would you how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment\nWhich was used to grant citizenship to this flames and their descendants and not being used to grant citizenship to anybody gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here and\nA blue wave means massive massive rail line but and it doesn't look possible they are going to they're going to win the Senate if they don't win the Senate there isn't any blew away if I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want if they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blow away weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented Republicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\n\nBut big inclusion isn't there has been all blue way there's not even been a blue ripple back you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip some blue bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blow congressional districts and major coastal cities\nSo this guy is off the firm belief that a conservative red wave or Republican red wave is coming and is on the way [noise]\nMany other people are ... I I've heard some people that were rush look if you got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements\nThat's that's [noise] such\nA toss up I don't know how to factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than where ever used to having a factor\nIn\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats has been or has been lost I think by the way the political professionals are going to be\nHyping the fact that as things stand I this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places same stand now looks like the Democrats might win\nAre going to be hyping the fact that as things stand I this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places thinks that now it looks like the Democrats might when my house by to maybe ... and that's going to be designed to get you\nTo not get lazy and over confident but don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the\nIs the evidence of panic\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by media because their efforts to derail Trump\nHave failed every one of them including one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly co loaded with the Russians Robert Mueller was supposed to have delivered to go with\nThe special counsel buying now all was supposed to have core Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way out by now do not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope\nOr the special counsel investigation\nBarring an actual report they had been hoping and praying for a week\nThat would be\nIn the beginning of the report does say that Mahler found hard\nEvidence that Trump important cheated and stole the election from the ... but there aren't even any such leaks\nThat's the big one that has blown up do not doubt me on this\nBy now Mahler was supposed to have delivered the guards that drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks\nSo now it's off the plan B and plans and see and so forth and that's why I say that kind of it's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they feel confident\nIn a in a blue wave let's take a brief time out will come back we'll delve into

[noise]\nRetiring Republican to lose some of them were rhinos I mean I look like they're not their own total losses there were a lot of never Trump or is it in there and that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five but a lot of them quip because they were just\nUp that Trump won and that Trump was leading the Republican Party\nLot of them I don't know about the total number forty five but a lot of them quip because they were just fed up\nThat Trump won and the Trump was leading the Republican Party and they want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't go to go back just being a regular house bozos because it's such a calm down you know to have been a committee chairman then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture\nIn their place\nAnd this this orders while in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nomination was replaced knees never Trump hers were retiring are Trump supporters\nThey were Trump and saw the the total number forty five resigning is not ... in and of itself a completely negative\nCharacteristic the power of incumbency still can't be denied it's an amazing thing I think it's still true house races in Ninety eight percent of them the incumbents wins\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that and the left wants\nThose changes the left wants this country over thrown from the days of its founding\nOut to the left America's illegitimate it's morals it's in the Senate because we were a slave nation and we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers\nThere were no founding mothers only founding fathers never bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up our country for themselves and their descendents so goes the argument leaving everybody else out and it's time to overthrow the ebb and change it and it's a serious moment and it's\nIt's a if you can trace the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise]\nAn offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where the changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story\nDonald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and the end to birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed a ... a unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric what a week to go before they print it go mid term\nElections Trump's vow to\nEnter the right to citizenship for children of non citizens and an authorized immigrants born in America came in an interview with ... was\nYesterday Trump did not say when even signed the order and some of his past promises using executive action have gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions intended\nThe thrust ... matter of immigration ended the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks as I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like\nHe was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore\nAnd you know what that means you know was held this country together all these years is the honoring him a lecture results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and elements that really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago you can go back two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left what convinced that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away if people were set up with the Florida recount remember all that\nYeah the Al Gore got job the Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened to Republicans won an added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're going to\nThe seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe a lot of values basis that goes in\nExit polls showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican well fast forward if two thousand six than there is no knowledge with a Trump won they do not accept\n\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama the O. J. we're used to overthrow run a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse Muslim actual results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured even more violence on the rats that we haven't yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find the period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back and fight the civil war but if he is a seminal moment when a political party\nAs its official position refuses to accept election results and that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump they don't feel good about it they just read whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing\nBecause what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nYou know I I predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out as well let's just eliminate elections elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade them\nPeople laugh ... mind why it's never going to have to do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\n\nSo now Trump rather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept this election or rather these feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back\nWith additional energy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order and birthright citizenship is huge and it's why he was elected\nWhen things are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong an out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries and Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing with the left just do it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they have made the promises Trump made I think all of them would've caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't he doubled down All right I'm just I'm going to shoot executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the or the fourteenth amendment ... begins\nAll persons not the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ... I think it was ratified by Congress and agents sixty six\n... it was passed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so eight in sixty six it was passed by Congress to ratify the state's Eighteen sixty eight and its original intent was to grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nAnd it was part and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself\nIt was a good thing or our constitution was written so that mistakes at the sound that could be corrected the vast majority of people do slavery at the founding was was uncomfortable but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they have to accept slavery but they built in safeguards to wipe it out they have happened and agents sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this white all\nPersons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S end of the state where in\nMay reside it was clearly intended to be referring to slams and their descendants the parts that birthright citizenship a freaks have to delete\nArt naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that rub\nYou are not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegal you cannot possibly be naturalized\nWell\nThe birthright citizenship crowd which ones don't watered down American culture and destroy western civilization conveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\n\nSo you were born here child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what probably say Trump is finally pushing back against an assumption that has been made because it was the least\nPath of resistance if you will but now it's it's make or break time\n\nAs my friend McCarthy says you need somebody to break the furniture [noise] sometimes you got to remodel house I got a quick", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "30"}
