appreciate All right now coming up the other big big news though and hold on if you have good comments to make ... insights questions because we are going to stay on that issue but we have to a dip into what happened yesterday the announcement of the big new NAFTA deal\nWhich is now called the U.S MCA United States Mexico Canada agreement us MCA and big announcement huge promise a maid and a huge promise delivered by Donald Trump\nGot very little coverage frankly that not the coverage and deserves the U.S trade representative was the man behind that a deal a Bob Lighthizer will join us here on the ...\n[noise]\nTalk to the\n\n\nMovies are you all responsible person to find yourself going deeper and deeper and credit card debt and you're not sure how to fix the problem\nA a new NAFTA relief is the title and the new deal is worse\nThan the status quo but disaster was avoided um and it's very specific criticisms but a ... year reaction to the naysayers who are out there saying that well used stripping protections against predatory government behavior for most foreign investors\nOr the new deal also takes a giant step toward politically managed trade by imposing new rules of origin labor rags\nHow you got to let you tee off on a couple of those\nWell I mean I don't want to specifically focus on the wall Street Journal they've been sort of against the idea of changing after from the beginning you have to start with the ... with\nThe position was NAFTA in this current state good or bad well we have large deficits every everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgrade it is a crazy\nAnd then in addition to changes in the economy we had very large deficits and\nWe were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies [noise] ah to Mexico and other places so the people who say we shouldn't have to have um we shouldn't renegotiated this thing or just that you know engaging in self deception I might I might know that\nBoth the secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president promised\nThat would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned done so\nWhat the president did which I which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trade bloc in in history at one point\nTwo trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America give us who have to pay my bills and do I care about\nAnd better in a whole variety of ways it's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America they there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis\nWe call it a review provision their labor rights which had never been like this ever in an agreement before there's access\nOn agriculture there is there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital trade middle actual property protection financial services all these [noise] these uh twenty first century economy kinds of things there were no adequate rules and now we have um there's even very good rules are\nOn the environment and what's your beyond anything we've negotiated before which I'm I'm proud of there's there's very strong and enforceable rules on currency which we've never had an a trade agreement before there there are limitations on data local is Asian which is an important thing for the digital trade people we have limitations on how state owned enterprises\nWhich is you think China can subsidize so there's there's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important to Graham it\nBetter than the than anything in the states as having to go she ate it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys all have to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is the the the President Trump trade a I'm a ... type and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nWe're talking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nA Bob one of the things that were wondering how this works in a still a Republican majority Congress could this mean what's the mechanism for this passing when there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct [noise]\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh\nHopefully strongly there there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah outsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats little posted in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that\nOr the thinking doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think ah the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticisms you have which is sort of an odd one\nIn the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well\nWe never should have talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should uh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan for working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being\nPurely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she ate it then I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood\n... said specifically regarding on a slick listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work\nMeans our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they will be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn from the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nI guess my I I mean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that they're they're so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all\nThe ... the major auto companies General Motors Ford SCA was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all set is going to move more jobs back to America but\nThat's not a bad thing a that's a good thing they've all set is workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take them to sort of sit down and boosting their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just reading something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this is going to be really very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back we at the end by the way it's not bad\nVery important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to\nThe biggest single thing we do we just give you an idea of the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do want is we increase the content of cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff we're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that a bad thing under under the ... the person who is going to lose out on this is China\nAnd places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in America duty free it's completely lunacy the people don't live with her talking about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise] be made in a high wage area that is to say in America\nThat could be Canada also but in America for the most part that's\nNot a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those car should be made in America by American labor\nNow I think what President Trump promised on this on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bob Lighthizer USC are ah what's next I mean are you guys gonna get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland and some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they've and Swiss they're anxious to do a deal with you guys I Know that first hand [noise]\n[noise] yeah no we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise]\nWe have a lot of things that we're doing a small deal dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about where talked I won't go through 'em but there's a bunch of other countries and then of course the big the big elephant in the room just China\nAnd one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the wall Street Journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things to sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S in the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this is like one of\nOne of the things that you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the five to prove the opposite and then the other ones oh you should look at it I I ask

I I don't even have words for that it's outrageous but I don't think this goes over well\nMiddle America I don't think it goes over well in most places outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts or maybe it on the college campuses speaking of the college campuses this\nUh Georgetown professor we're going to be delving into more of this a Republican senators should die miserably be said to pigs for supporting cabinet and she has had a history of nasty\nComments about Trump supporters uh\nAnd calling them all sorts of names and Raymond made a good point that\nCan you imagine if a professor who was it even even modestly a Republican said anything\nResembling ... it at the vitriolic nature of what this professor Christine fair at\nGeorgetown said what that would that slightly Republican professor survive\nProfessor would be run off campus not that there are many Republican professors anyway would be run off campus that that's that's that's ... that's ... you're expressing your expressing male aggression or if it's a well\nWe already had one ... um male professor have to apologize for making a simple comment simple comment about credibility and Christine Ford get into more of this but the double standard is just unbelievable\nThe views of faculty members expressed in their private capacities or their own and not the views of the university does that mean if someone express racist views on Twitter that that person would not would not be fired from Georgetown\nOur policy does not prohibits speech based on a person presenting ideas or the context of those ideas even when those ideas maybe difficult controversial or objectionable well faculty members may exercise freedom of speech\nWe expect that their classrooms and interaction with students be free of bias in geared toward thoughtful respectful dialogue\nWell when you go to go on that rate your professor website\nUm some interesting reviews of this particular professors teaching style come up\nA namely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that unbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this in a conservative it wouldn't it would never happen\nThere is no discussion questioning or did they in our class simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed worse or lectures or never supported just presented his unvarnished dogma this is not what Georgetown is about says the latest rate my professor rating\n[noise]\nSo this is um this is where we are in American academia if this if this were a Republican professor in his private capacity\nTweeting support for Kavanaugh for anything at using the same type of language towards Christine Ford supporters\nHe would be fired they would figure out a way to run him off campus even if he were tenured that figure out a way to do even if they had to pay him they'd get them off campus do you agree with me eight five five forty Laura\nAh we'll talk more about this a and a woman who

for us that we are to believe them simply because they're women simply because there are many of them are victims that there have been abuses in the past\nBut this isn't that the standard by which we judge people we judge people on stocks rationality and the judge people\nBased on what can we present and the evidence ... feelings and this attack on Kavanaugh grilling how about you know do you remember walking out do you remember getting drunk and how you behave in college and just always the presumption of\nGuilt going forward and in every way that they have questioned him and it's it's completely dangerous inappropriate\nUh now describe if you don't mind your thoughts on on Christine forward given your a knowledge of her as an undergraduate right\nI I was a classmate of hers I wasn't in her\n... friendship share but I was in her circles and I know the environment that she was on but we were all in especially her freshman and sophomore year we were\nPartying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture and my weight and bringing it up is not to blame her\nFor her you know if she if she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way you deserve to get raped but my point is is if you only have he said she said if you don't have any corroborating evidence then you need to look at the character of both people need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we're doing in college and you know we should be ... you know if you're going to grill\nBrett Kavanaugh about this she also needs to be looked at as well because she's bringing these accusations without any kind of cooperating evidence little can't forget that weight\nAnd she also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that she did well in high school you know really what was going on during that period sheltered change the timeframe from being in the mid eighties or early eighties she kept\nPushing it back and forth with it happening college or happen in high school\nOr really flush out exactly what her story is she right on the stand the lawyer would grill or about that they would grow or about the details of her comment on how we have to hold her with kids was\nRight then again the feminists were supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own they're not a bunch of damsel in distress and yet\nYou're exactly right on the incremental last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to the a credibility gap for ms toward a in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who was a six month prosecutor who my political figure who said look changing narratives\nChanging story of a memory of even recent events she needs to change or is unclear\nA not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a I'm not a ban a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of cooperating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nIn fact he writes about how she made people feel because\nI didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest and she didn't she didn't like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing that's so Trump traumatized her for more years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and redecorating and you know we had\nNo emotion that corresponded\nWith what she was saying ... the trauma and horrors of it all what they would have been more anger there we're going we're\nHere and passion and more directed she would detach she her anytime she ever talked about the assault\nShe was very detached and her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can disassociate dissociate when their rights and stuff but she wasn't right and this is thirty six years later and she said she has PATS the which means that you're heightened awareness of what happened and so\nShe just did not she was not ... feelings or fat but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts and the fact that measure up she lives in an environment and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things come down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance\nOf her life and his life if we're going to frame this kind of thing that the last minute ...\nOn down but you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing that the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with a contract right before Supreme Court nomination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that we've got to really we need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or or Kavanaugh\nIt's about our liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principle that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing the behavior of\nYou know attacking people in public restaurants or elevators or you know these the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers are the ones who are are the first to get in your face first ones\nOh absolutely because they're driven by irrationality they've banned in fact they've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level\nSo all they have their subject is failing and power and if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of object objective truth in order to have dialogue\nThen the most powerful the biggest bully in the room that's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of rolling\nTheir bully everyone in order to advance their power and it and part of that's been ... there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over\nThose who are trying to use you and you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on in different kinds of fears now it's going on in the titan relationship scare of men and women and its ripping our country of heart\nAnd if we if this means that we have to let ... rapist go free because we can't prove that it's better to stay presumption of innocence just said the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty\nOh I'm actually the fact that just real life that that's what it's about being in a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake\nWho lived up to his last name I mean the the their perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from it that's like a kid like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorists at the type of political and emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel they have to feel the heat right back on them\nAs as a journalist and I say this in a in a in a way meaning glove journalists and don't like to demonize the fake news and so forth would imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their face screaming at them at it I think that'd be the first ones to say wait a second you're intimidating the press but what about intimidating a a a a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station is as Maxine Waters urged people to go after them and it does that count at all parents do not\nKnow and and but we like you said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are\nA and that is one of my reasons for challenging a\nChristian board about you know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing or anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she within and again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecuting him than we need to ask her the same kind of questions\nAnd you know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in a political sphere then why should we believe we're not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to ... just because you're allowed and bowling and yelling at us and and the restaurants\nYou know we're ... we're not we're not one to have to take it for you\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election with all about don't you\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of bad\nPolicies bad economic policies bad foreign policy and twisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called BS and all of it\nAnd he said look I'm Out of it and I've done all
