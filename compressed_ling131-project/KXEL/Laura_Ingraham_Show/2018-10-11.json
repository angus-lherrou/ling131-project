[noise]\nAll all of America scissors are wavering love and support [noise]\n\nLike King Kong of a storm has better through most of the Florida Panhandle at this hour a thousand miles north of the storm president Donald Trump is tending to political business story at a campaign fund raiser and rally in Erie, Pennsylvania is a devastating split screen if you will\nChris Matthews and [noise]\nA few of the uh\nMal contents on MSNBC but they're they're desperately trying to grasp on to something to change the narrative about the rabid\nLeft turn of not the hurricane but of their own party [noise]\nSo Donald Trump goes to a rally because tens of thousands of people were waiting and there was nothing he was going to be able to do at this moment that wasn't being done to help the people in the panhandle and as you can see from the comments from Rick Scott Marco Rubio and Rhonda Santas they were getting [noise]\nAll the help they need it and then some and the preparedness on the part of a Florida was just it's amazing\nAnd it's and it's a horrible thing to see this flood coming in a in the aftermath of hurricane Michael could have been a lot worse but it's still bad I mean the fact that this storm actually moved\nThe direction that it did by twelve miles and hits the air force base didn't hit the residential area as it could have I mean this could have been I mean as bad as it looks this could've been a ... just heart wrenching loss of life so we're going to find out\nMore about this or as a day goes on as daylight hits the panhandle and you're able to see just how much damage was done or the strongest hurricane to hit the panhandle apparently ever\nA but again the area in which it hit was not where they thought it was initially going ahead and in Panama and Panama beach area so we thank God for that but still a huge amount of damage was done [noise] so do you think Donald Trump\nVoted to allow the hail a veto by the time we know the will to Washington liberals

concerned that President Trump and other Republicans are characterizing Democrats as an angry mob\nThe Amazon Prime Washington Post ran a long story about it whining that portraying Democrats as an angry mob evokes fear in people\nBut President Trump has it right folks Democrats like Maxine Waters encourage the mob to harass Republicans in their private lives and the left wing moms do it\nWe have seen Democrats angry mobs threatened Republicans on social media we have seen Democrats angry mobs attack\nEducation secretary Betsy the boss press secretary Sarah Huckabee Senator Ted Cruz and his wife and others we've heard the mob demonic screaming in the halls of Congress and we've seen them circling elected officials venting their rage\nThey are a mob there deranged they're lunatics they're angry they're out of control psychological disorders and they're getting worse by the hour\nAnd that's why we drive by media is worried they know that when Republicans cast the Democrat Party

he's right don't try to please the left do the right thing makes her Florida is taking care of a it's a judgment call I could've gone either way on that frankly but it is pretty it is\nPretty hard when you have all these people there and you you have taken care of business in Florida you got FEMA on it you got all the emergency station set up they're being given all the support they need and you're back in what two hours\nIt's it's I think it would have been a tougher call if it were in like Minnesota or California\nThen it's five hours out five hours back but it's not like the president isn't constantly on the phone I mean he does have world class communication on air force one this is not like you just checked out of the hurricane but again you're not pleasing these people let's go to Dennis in Florida\nWest Palm Beach Florida where I just was over the weekend ... red tide and I'm not talking about the kind we want was brutal\nI got my lungs still hurt from that red tide that fumes that uh I inhaled at the beach go ahead\nWe all have our issues here in Florida it's part of our lives now or to what I Would like to say though is the last night I don't know if anyone mentioned but\nThe lady that was on from the Democratic party [noise] um I don't know if you noticed or not but when you were talking about someone being hurt or even killed she actually smiled [noise] I found that a bit frightening\nI miss that I got to go back and look at that I'm so focused on the show I'm not kind of looking at the er at the gas and the double boxer yeah I I'm very worried that someone's going to get hurt\nOr with how left in ... left wing and rabid and frenzy the leftist becoming where to go back to the Eric Holder remind you a little bit more of why Eric Holder was always a problem he's going to be running for president\nHolder if Booker it's perhaps Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren maybe on Bernie Sanders going to give it another world ah but I'm going to remind you of what kind of person\nAnd eighty a log that Eric Holder is later on in the show for those of you who've forgotten remember he said yesterday when they go low we kick them basically\nIs Michelle Obama must love that let's go to Virginia and Calvin on line one I Love the name Calvin Calvin do have\nYes I see a red light hobby\nA ... way in part of a state where I live um we don't live up in a bubble of the DC area we live out in the ... part of the weather is to get those if you\nCan't hear you account I Can't call back when you're on a good line you're in a brutal line there but I Love the commonwealth of Virginia Virginia changed demographically and its\nAre you a calorie count call back when you're on a good line you're in a brutal line there but I Love the commonwealth of Virginia Virginia changed demographically and it's changed politically\nAnd the connection is obvious guy or immigration growing government presence it's changed Virginia\nBut I think the good people or Virginia the what's happened with this economy they don't want to go backwards and anyone out there listening anyone you know in Virginia seventh district thinking you're thinking of of not voting or your complacent you better get out there and vote in the seventh district of Virginia specially and of course Dave Brat as what I'm Talking about\nThe day brat race is key he is a Trump guy he's a conservative he is hard working he seeks to represent the interests of the citizens of the commonwealth of Virginia and he does a great job get out and vote\nEverybody has to get out and vote if you can already voted early vote early but get out and vote Rhonda Santas and Florida she adds up against this ... this horrible socialist guilt we Florida governorship it's going to be a bad deal so everybody's got to get out and vote\nThat he and he's getting millions and millions of dollars from a left wing billionaires Gillum even as the mayor of a ... of one of the few cities in Florida that was handled and run really badly you want him nowhere near the\nGovernorship I can tell you that right now eight five five forty Laura or go to Mike in Arizona on line three Mike\nHow are you I'm great I was so proud to be a conservative and I love my president I think you did a great job handling this I don't want him to cater to the Democrats how do you do what they're getting any sure\nThey'd accused him of being wrong then if you didn't gone down they're paid more attention to show leadership you do what you were supposed to be I think in order for the suffering because [noise] so I see a red wave in our area I don't know of any Democrats are going to be elected year I'm\nI'm just like\nMy own and then just like you got to hand a timely due to the right thing on Kavanaugh I mean\nHe that would've been a real kick in the stomach of conservatives if he hadn't voted for cabinet ... any ultimately did so that's a good thing I'm going to look at the glass half full here because that's the only way you can go forward or the Federal Reserve though I Trump is I was going to do a segment on this last night on the show and we ... we were so jammed up we couldn't do it\nOr going to do it tonight on the anger mangled pertinent ten pm eastern Fox\nNews all\n\nThe fun starts to move indoors with friends and family to make sure your most important home improvement project is handled with select blinds dot com interior designers agree that one of the easiest ways to improve rooms appearance is by upgrading your old blind shades and shutters\nAnd of course now as Donald Trump doesn't care about the hurricane victims\nYeah which is which is nonsense I mean it's very clear that the\nPresident and his entire team had been working very closely with the governors of Florida Alabama and Georgia and I think it an appropriate time the president will go down to visit but as you know\nA head he tried to go down last night it would have been a nightmare because that would hurt all Lugar all of the various workers away from what they should be doing to trying to take care of the president on straight so he'll get their president but I also just wants to be just you know whatever Donald Trump does\nHe's going to be attacked\nThese people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know he's done something terrible what is it\nAnd that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that again the the theory and the friends the ah has gotten to a point knew that and I was talking to folks that yesterday who were in Washington and in Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy uh both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything at this angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nYeah I think I think basically you add extra ordinary intensity up through Watergate you had a mommy at a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point a U.S soldiers\nAnd through Watergate you had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports that are being harassed a man who is a very bitter very divisive time ah but I think after that\nUh we became sort of more normal for a while\nAnd uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said that it wasn't and actors that shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin on\nIts because we want to return to hey constitutionally based court system that uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result\nIf your a left wing a Democrat we we we're at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately to change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American so I think that has become just an enormously bitter blow for the\nUh people who who thought up into election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton was going to when they go at the two justices you've got\nAnd Hillary bin ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that it will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now or I Want to play\nFor you or Larry ... who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for them in terms\nIf there has ever been and abnormal presidency were in it and a Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen\nIt's just a question of how big the blue wave is they can be a Saddam a it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way there's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right but it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just one hey you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic or and we won for the first time on a hundred and thirty nine years once his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee and Arizona's now heads or how come that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in\nNorth Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points in his in\nTennessee is people to realize that ... actually the Democrats actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system branch and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up affecting our program dumb as getting a sense of\nYou know something out of self sabotage and say ah where's the where is the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races\nAnd some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum versus Ron I'm a scientist because for me and for so many of watch the growth of flow Florida and how well it's been a run by Rick Scott\nAnd and to the idea of turning that state over is critical that stayed in that country electoral politics to a guy who is basically a socialist it's just that just cannot happen and yet he's getting millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean give them as a [noise]\nThe latest great hope\nBecause he came out of nowhere as a radical Democrats uh he won an upset victory a heat the key temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that there's a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win or in a landslide and the reasons exactly why uh we're building a majority in the country\nThey get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign that drives home again and again and again\nThe difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work and I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance\nAnd certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nA I think that's I I don't think people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I Would if I get that but I think the this frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this ... thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup so that's my sense of it in holders comments Maxine Waters\nI don't know I think all of it is it it gives people a bad feeling\nWell and I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible here of jobs being created give the lowest\nBlack on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out uh people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George Soros and others actually pay for them uh which doesn't\nBang on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George stores and others actually pay for them uh which doesn't you know does that justify\nBut the whole system that the left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh\nBefore the midterm uh elections and there's one on October Fifteen\nOr where you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and they'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in

repeat that an evening with Newt dot com Leo beep and I are going to be they're talking about our American stories and I'm going to take questions and frankly let the audience direct me I'm going to

best selling books of all time and literature and history a bill I Want to\nTalk about what you see because you one of the smartest political analysts out there all your experience and reporting over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse than um you expected and are we approaching perhaps a Nineteen sixty eight\nStyle a type of frenzy in the streets\nBut I think we're ... or beyond that now I think it's worse that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career but yeah basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement ever seen in this country ever in the history of the country\nSo you have a guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money we're basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depends\nOn what they're told to do [noise] um you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in the Kavanaugh hearings that send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know they're confined senators in elevators or whether CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't accidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it because this huge money behind it but they don't now instead they pro hold it\nThere in business with the radical left in business with their CNN and MSNBC make money\nLots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence\nTo get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that ah the president's handling\nOf this ah the star and the way he's addressed it has been health so has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on the way I just\nWait it out to you and your listeners are just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have\nOrganizations that are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change [noise] All right and you've got twenty of them\nAnd they take their orders from big money to radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted senator\nFlake and the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\n... no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous oh this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism accumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods are there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged\nAnd the media in Germany uh basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause at George Soros so I was a little bit more extreme than the editor to the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was linked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people had the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all out on the one to her all lying by the way they were all line too I have a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm All right and and I saw things level to get\nI went through this myself mhm All right and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane and\nI you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to want to make a decision right the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want they can do exactly what they want and they almost got cabinet they almost got him\nAnd this is a kind of country why\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except that\nAccept it because it's been in Plano for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system then I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he picks everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence you process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say hey don't matter\nPresumption of innocence of somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and have that\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing and I think bill you know I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nTell I Am I Am petrified of this I ... I completely agree with you and I was slammed\nFor the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my true this\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a throne does it take to the curb denounced to um put upon across crucified lose a promotion this is going to stop\nThat 'cause that could happen to anybody well and it had happened it happened to me it had have obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things in it it is a brutal\nUnfair situation and and once you're accused of something where do you go to a regulation that way\n\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of the capital and mess my new column host Bill O'Reilly dot com as it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how are your truth says replaced bought truth\nOkay so ... and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now wants to honor Christine for ... and and I I mean I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened\nThis is Chris ... friday night as your you and I had the volleyball team is on the road to take on southern Illinois and we'll start with the pregame show it by forty five ... served at the hands of all evil versus southern Illinois this Friday night on you're holding the Panthers loose talk Fifteen forty ...

opening\nAs a and a story and I find it fascinating as a political conservative I think there's much to rejoice to be quite Machiavellian about is is that the Democratic party is doing itself great great damage\nAnd you know you wouldn't worry if you you know if you're a conservative Republican you were if the Democrats came out and for strong national defense and the tax cuts\nAnd morality at home and on the streets and law and order and and basically came out with the same positions as a Republican that because they make themselves competitive with the Republicans and then it would get down to who's better it delivering these things a lot of people still believe the Democrats are better energy in government than the than than the Republicans are\nSo but at the Democratic party was going on a direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guaranteeing\nA the reelection of a of a Donald Trump and two thousand twenty by making themselves so march

the chief law enforcement officer advocate violence ... it's it's ... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence or Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil with people who want to destroy your\nYour beliefs are so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you had Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she liked it for over\nYeah yeah yeah yeah from the ... let me give you another struggle now gee if I may place is\nThat in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges campuses where a flame uh the radical up being funded by the KGB and she argue which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier more touchy more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominated George McGovern was a lunatic and who got you know creamed by Richard Nixon and Nineteen Seventy two it's oh so the Democrats\nSwore that weren't going to happen again so they they took control of the party and and nominated a centrist Jimmy Carter and won the Republican the Democratic party is now spinning out of control again as it did in sixty eight\nVirtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time to feeding in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because of mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was a Nineteen Seventy two\nNo three social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taken power this is part of the reason why\nThe leftist so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a sad joke itself let's face it the New York times has said Joe CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time\nI watched any programming on those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does just that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lower income show and Fox News and to weed out Newsmax and one American news and conservative talk radio and blocks and\nAnd so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite there were telling their marginal viewers Marshall readers larger listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and last it\nAt a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a\nI think appear calm and the storm don't you agree with that I\nWrote Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change a board it but but one thing they do believe\nIs is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than Brock Obama certainly better than Hillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know a job or Peru and things like that as a ... economy can prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but ... is pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer I'm so many great Reagan bucks how Reagan dealt with the ... riots and will will play a bit of sound on those who missed the show last night let's listen\nThose people told you four days in advance\nWith the riots and will will play a bit of sound on those who missed the show last night let's listen\nTo those people told you four days in advance that if the university's sought to my hand with that construction\nThey were going to physically destroy the university and I and many times negotiate what she said what is your whole season public institution that's right but the universe its own community on for the community in Berkeley the live around on them and\nBegan the first time some of you who know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they have the right to choose the laws they would say as long as they were doing it and the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah now point gene construction he was talking about oh\nThere were there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they want to do a a build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam you know the north Viet Cong soldiers that if it was completely out of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler Feldman the establishment is what I was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was he said warmly ruthless than if you listen to Reagan associates professors somebody of your old up an odd no better you know the way he just\nStamp but so smoothly and so clearly and so you know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nNow and I just I Love the fact that he ... he he went right to the ... the salient point here Craig which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions\nCan justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble ... that it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal moving in modern American conservatism\nIs is that you know rule of law is one thing or is this that the rule the mob is quite another by the way this idea that a over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up ... tweeted out this morning Webster's Dictionary ... a ... a describes a mob\nAs being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political uh people but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the mob one of the Tea Party when they're but during the period ... yeah and that's\nWhy the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberal side of protest they must be one of the same no they're not wanting the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough\nRight as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well if you if you want to want to stand up for women and algae BT and all it then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nYeah well but that may be upset this before the show I beg your pardon the ... but\nThe difference today between moderate conservative leader mark certain politician than a modern liberal politician is the liberal politician goes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know\nIt but it but a moderate conservative and that's an emotional response because because liberals going to do with the good things for you a moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power so I may give it back to you\n... have to think\nAbout it you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican a form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration that comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended it to be there in the first place\nA again power to power to the people the let me just I walked that slogan but they never really ... but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the republic\nNo power to the people\nStays with them not some some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a critic I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of

Rosenstein in fact had Rosenstein up to the White House and men had him on air force one flew him around them got off the airplane with him so they have a good working relationship\nThe president
