are going to talk about a different role for him he's Tim Harwood the host of the K\nActually all morning news on energy media station news talked Fifteen forty KFC out but he is also\nThe author of the brand new book released earlier this week called ... rival and departure of the NBA in Iowa published by the University of Iowa press and we spoke earlier this week about it\nWhat led you to start writing books more broadly and then I'll ask specifically why this book at this time\nWell in addition to the the things that you mentioned I also have a some history with the Waterloo black ... and ... back in around two thousand eight two thousand nine as I was trying to pull together some information about black ... history I was finding that\nThere weren't the resources I really expected to find a looking for statistics looking for\nRecords you'd have the the total season record wins and losses you know where the team finished but you wouldn't know what games were played what the scores were who's at the top players were from some of the early years when the United states hockey league was at the junior level\nAnd so I I went to the library with the idea that I'm sure this is just in the newspaper I just have to find the right issue and it'll all be there in the in the aggregate section that small print where it's got all the all the details that the the really wonky sports fans go after and I was completely wrong\nBut I looked around enough to give myself the sense that I could recreate that\nBy doing a lot of reading looking at a lot of microfilm and that was the genesis for a first book which came out in twenty eleven just in time for the fiftieth season of Waterloo black clocks hockey and uh around that same time because there was\nA a reputation building than I was interested in hockey history and the cedar valley uh someone brought me an article from a new edition of the courier back in the mid fifties talking about another team that had played at what is now again the hit the drum ... are back in the twenties and so\nBecause the the methodology was there for going to find the information after I'd done it once\nBack to the microfilm I went to go find out about the hockey team that applied in Waterloo in the twenties\nAnd I think a lot of people have heard this as a kid bit of information but I'm not sure ah that many people have the full story\nOf course there was a basketball team that played in that same building in Waterloo in the late forties into the early fifties that was part of the original National Basketball association so with two projects already wrapped up done basically the same way\nWhy not go back because there's a method there let's go find the information and put together their story because one I don't think many people knew in great detail\nThose earlier two books about hockey in the cedar valley they're available at totally Iowa dot com if you're interested but this book ball hawks and I agree with you that there are people who may have sort of heard that there was an NBA\nIf you're interested but this look ...\nAnd I agree with you that there are people who may have soared I've heard that there was an NBA team in Waterloo but we think of today's NBA\nWith Steph Curry and LeBron James and before that Michael Jordan before that Larry Bird et cetera we think of the NBA on that stage this was the absolute beginning of the professional basketball league that we now know globally\nYeah the the NBA at that time was just a kernel of of what it would become and in fact it was actually two different leagues which will make sense when you hear their names there was the national basketball league which was mid western based it was the older league\nA lot of other communities that you could compare favorably to Waterloo are the least would strike some similarities places like Sheboygan, Wisconsin in Osh Kosh Wisconsin or the quad cities Molina in particular\nI had a very successful team in the national basketball league there were some other teams from places like Chicago in Indianapolis that were obviously a little bit bigger\nYou can sit and consume it in a couple of days a week or whatever\nAnd as a reader you're then hungry for more but as the author these are multi year projects to get to that point then and it's it's always a gratifying when you actually open the box at home and get to see the book for the first time\nJim thanks so much for adding to our common knowledge most importantly but thanks for sharing the story today thank you\nTim Harwood is the author of ball

more than ever before what were the airwaves can reach into every home today people that have the man's can hear the gospel in every part of the world\nMore than when I was younger than we've talked about the he's the\nThat are common having never heard the gospel now every place that can reach the airwaves and much of it by the printed page that certainly could be done the thousand years before the day when the thousand years and plus that printing what's known\nToday the Bible is available all over the place\nI've been to India so it's easy to get there is it is here some people in Africa want it because they can't afford it but it's available the word of God we need to continue to pray that God or sent laborers into the field that are white or the ... where the labor's are few\nOr are those areas and sadly our own country is getting more and more that way\nThere's people that speak to today on the radio but tell me they can find a church within driving distance that preaches the whole conflict God less and less some of the early churches that we're here with our program for fathers and following that\nToday people are living it by the thousands they say the word is no longer face some go to different denominations some sadly leave the church entirely\nWe are a nation in trouble\nI say it again we are a nation in trouble we made the gospel we need the power of the gospel bad very badly\n\nOr government needs it we're so people needed our government is what it is because of what we are as people we have voter them those that are wrong and many areas\nWe can be thankful

come to that\nAre those who are still complain about our present government but I'm Glad the complainer aren't in power what would that would be like anarchy\nThere like the people described in the Bible lewd men\nTerrible damage awful things happening and we just be thankful if not worse for the ... I Believe the gospel are settled in how we pray for the rest of the nation and if we don't have that right ourself\nThen we have to do like the Lord Jesus said to the hospital Harry and George from until you can do with power from on high the church needs that\nWe need revival and I said before we need awakening awakening to the fullest of the gospel of Christ as Kevin here and then we need awakening if we are truly saved we have been awakened to what we are in our natural condition\nIn Christ speaks of that after he says ... not his son in the world to condemn the world without the world who have might be saved\nOr said they didn't have to believe us on him is not condemned but he does believe us not is condemned already because the house not believed in the name of the only big got them some have gone\nWhy are we condemned without Christ\nFirst of all we can have the answer inverse Fifteen or sixteen without the gospel we will perish either believe will show not perish it's a description of the\nGospel coming to a parish in people inverse Eighteen either believe us not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only big awesome summer God we are the only living in a house on fire\nIf we don't want that which could put the fire out\nThe God we are the only living in the house some swagger that we don't want that which could put the fire out we're doubling condemn\nWere condemned by the law of God and were condemned if we don't want to receive the gospel as lawbreakers and that's what we are we are lawbreakers we do not\nTo obey the commandments of going part of them as the ten commandments thou shalt not they'll show up not some of them are positive like the children will be your parents but\nMany of them are do show that should not commit adultery social not steal shutting out ... witness shut not covered all those God Forbid\nBut there was also a very positive teaching in the long God\nAnd I guess one question was asked what is the first one great commandment he gave the summary particularly up the first part of the commandment thou shalt love the lord by going with all of that car would all they saw what all day straight\nAnd then he added the second is like on to it and that encompasses the last part of the ten commandments we might call it the second table\nThose ... love thy neighbor as ...\nIs our nation doing none of those that voted for other than that are in power rubbing their neighbors their self hoping the best for them\nNo\nWe want to submit to what God has given instead they're super systems that we'll end with Dalmatian\nThat's what God says they shall receive to themselves damnation and God allows it he may bring detonation of the whole nation robbery systems to hell yes it's first of all to him gutters put those in power\nPresident leadership the last leadership I certainly didn't agree with the last leadership that we had again particularly in so many ways of marriage and the unborn got worse and worse\nBut we had her ... was a bus or didn't agree we had to wait on guard for stumping better something more helpful in those areas and God has given us that we should be thankful\nWe are to give thanks and to make stuff with Haitian for those in authority that we might need a quiet and peaceable life that's Paul's instruction to Tennessee and the only am sure we can only do it so the gospel\nThe Lord Jesus said just before ... without me you can do nothing that's so true so true so true that is why I made Christ and more of Christ and soda you beg him\nDo like the little soldiers nor Jesus come in today come in through state come into my heart for Jesus\nListen once more to\nSome of the words of that song that were some\nBefore ...

himself for king\nThey tried to assassinate nation as I said come visit us Nehemiah\nAnd many of my refuses to get off the wall he says I'm doing a great work I cannot and will not come down and there was character assassination\nThey told him through a a an inner person to seek protection and the temple behind closed doors because he was about to come under attack they thought if he ran to the

greed\nCausing some problems are rich nobles in officials among the Jews were taking advantage of the poor who are having to ... everything to pay their interest in taxes\nAnd try to keep food on

... years ago following the two most was Nineteen sixty eight election campaign national Democrats ought to make the presidential nomination process more transparent placing more power in the hands of voters instead of party leaders\nIowa Democrats adapted their precinct caucus system to elect delegates at the most local level from precincts to county conventions from there to district conventions then to the state convention and finally to the national convention\nIn order to go through that many steps given technological limitations of the time I was Nineteen Seventy two caucuses were held on January twenty fourth and soon a first in the nation tradition to coal\nBut after each election cycle Iowa has to fight to keep its status and as former state party chair and former congressman Dave Nagl notes it's led to a long alliance with New Hampshire which holds the first primary in the nation every four years\nNew Hampshire conducts the primary which is state government run\nIowa conducts the caucus which is run by the political parties the state government is not involved a and that is as it should be a because as the state government in New Hampshire says it will hold your selection process for you but we won't tell you what to do\nWith this ultimately is a choice of the Iowa Democratic party and the Republican Party in terms of how we want to select our nominee not told by the government who should select or ... or ... or who tilted towards one candidate or another but therein lies the problem\nThe DNC can't do anything to New Hampshire or they've tried in years past but it's a state run process and bill gardeners adamant that he's going to be first primary in the nation is he should be\nWe on the other hand or creature requires you approve of the state of Iowa but

course is to begin the delegate selection process that's the primary function of why they're held but it is also a party building operation the idea to more one on one with individuals develop a

that go on either way you know you would think\nAt the base of it in an absentee vote made the option to vote absentee give you get more people involved in the process and and and as such get more people\nInvolved in it within the party which would be good for the party but you know that's still not getting someone in the room that night you're engaged but you're not in the room so is is that the Democrats still think that's a good thing or or or they're concerned that that kind of create\nAn option that great some disconnected but that doesn't um uh you know keep someone as involved as

Iowa presidential precinct caucuses now with Troy price\nChair of the Iowa Democratic party we spoke at the party's headquarters in West Des Moines on September twenty seven as we're approaching\nThis conversation I'm the one thing that we want to do is make sure that we preserve and protect the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and you know at the end of the day what the Cox's are is you know never held ourselves out to be a primary it's a um neighborhood meeting when it doesn't matter\nHow much money you have it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter uh\nYou know who you are a everyone can come to this and that and they can have a spirited debate about what the future of our country should be and that's what ... and so we want to make sure that we can preserve that\nBut with the DNC is asking us to do a and\nThrough the changes that were passed in August is there's several uh pockets but the ones that kind of impact us the most here in Iowa will be one or allowing for some form of absentee participation for those who will not be able to or could not attend to reporting of the raw results\nFrom the first ... phase of the carcasses\nEnsuring that we have a recount procedure in place so that we can if a if it's a a close and if a campaign request that that we can in fact recreate what happens in a ... and ... be able to make sure that the results are accurate\nUm those are really kind of the three big buckets that we are looking at as we go forward here and the other one too is that locking the caucus night result is the final result so what has happened in years past is that you know at the county level if one side doesn't get the uh\nTheir folks out that enough\nIt can change and then it can change again at the district convention that could change again at the state convention in here\nUm the what happens on caucus night will be a is the winner and so from that point forward then everything will be preserved going up through the chain and so uh if it's projected that candidate acts gets for delegates to the DMZ well then they'll get for ... so we've got to work through things\nIf candidate ... wins that many delegates in Iowa but doesn't make it past South Carolina doesn't make it past Florida if they released their delegates does that then open it up either for free connection or for some sort of a portion meant or am I premature in that\nI think that this is where the devil is going to be the details as we\nAre also starting the process now we're out doing this I'm listening post across the state they're translucent feedback on how we might be able to do that and sort of thinking through this we have in so approximately\nYou know springtime a first part is going to be able to figure all this stuff out in our delegate slush and plans written submitted to the DNC and so for us where you're starting the process of really\nPick up in earnest after after election day but it's a believer in the process right now it's starting to think through that so to answer your specific question I don't know the answer to that yet and uh\n[noise] other states where that has happened when we were going to go take a look at how other states have dealt with this when they have primaries for example you know in New Hampshire the urban candidate to drop out shortly after New Hampshire but they still have so many delegates that they were secure on that night\nSo we just go through that process and civil finger on exactly how to do that [noise] one\nOf the big sticking points of course is bad how does Iowa State distinctive from New Hampshire and one of the concerns some had had was if you report raw vote totals then it's starting to look like New Hampshire if you have an absentee process it may be too much like New Hampshire\nThe first question is do you think that our singular identity will remain pure and secondly are the folks New Hampshire happy\n[laughter] well for us uh again uh we want to preserve the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and so we want to preserve that feeling where folks can come together and actually discuss the sea uh\nBecause it's one of the few places in politics that you can actually do that anymore and so we do want to make sure that but we also want to make sure that we're giving folks the opportunity to have their\nVoices heard um [noise] uh and for folks who may not be able to participate that's always been a challenge in years past and so we're going to take a really in earnest looking at how we might be able to make that happen\nIn terms of New Hampshire you know I've traveled out there a a\nEarlier this year and I talked with our secretary of state and I stay in regular communication with my counterpart New Hampshire\nAnd so you know we will continue to work with them and make sure that you know as we're going through this process keeps them up to date and you know is there any land mines that are or challenges that may be further down the road that we're not seeing\nMake sure that we're keeping folks in the loop on that so that the for early states have always worked really well together Iowa New Hampshire has definitely worked very well together over the last Thirty years\nFor sure and so um you know we want to make sure that we are continuing that process and also continue to work with our folks across the aisle here in the state I'm obviously the Republicans Republican process looks different than ours does report raw total 'em and they do allocate their dog it's based upon that and so\nFor us we want to you know\nIs this is a a a lot of conversations go into this process and it's\nNot something that I get to decide a or a you know you're in our FCC just unilaterally gets to decide we're obviously want to make sure that
