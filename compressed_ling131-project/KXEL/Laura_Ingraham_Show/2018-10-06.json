transparent and causes named people to participate in\nIowa was presidential precinct caucuses our topic this week\nThe I Will watch connection is presented by the I was there for public affairs journalism on line and I do watch got or here is just signed\nA whole this many years ago following the most was Nineteen sixty eight election campaign national Democrats ought to make the presidential nomination process more transparent placing more power in the hands of voters instead of party leaders\nIowa Democrats adapted their precinct caucus system to elect delegates at the most local level from precincts to county convention from there to district conventions then to the state convention and finally to the national convention\nIn order to go through that many steps given technological limitations of the time I was Nineteen Seventy two caucuses were held on January twenty four and soon the first in the nation tradition to coal\nBut after each election cycle Iowa has to fight to keep its status and as former state party chair and former congressman\nBut after each election cycle Iowa has to fight to keep it status and as former state party chair and former congressman Dave Nagl notes it's led to a long alliance with New Hampshire which holds the first primary in the nation every four years\nNew Hampshire conducts the primary which is state government run\nIowa conducts the caucus which is run by the political parties the state government is not involved a and that is as it should be a because as the state government in New Hampshire says it will hold your selection process for you but we won't tell you what to do\nWith this all of them is a choice of the Iowa Democratic party in the Republican Party in terms of how we want to select our nominee not told by the government who should select or ... or ... or who tilted towards one candidate or another but they're in lies the problem\nThe DNC can't do anything to New Hampshire or they've tried in years past but it's a state run process and build gardeners adamant that he's going to be first primary in the nation is he should be\nWe on the other hand or creature requires you approve of the state of Iowa but our governing body the Democratic National Committee and so they sent us on a road for conflict with New Hampshire\nEnd you're secured I Would never I mean not like that so that that that's going to be fascinating for me to sue\nCarcasses have multiple purposes one of which of course is to begin the delegate selection process that's the primary function of why they're held but it is also a party building operation the idea to work one on one with individuals develop a deeper base\nAre these changes in your mind going to enhance their party building or potentially have a negative effect on it especially with the possibility of absentee\nYeah yeah I could see that do and either way you know you would think\nAt the base of it in an absentee vote made the option to vote in the ... more people involved in the process and and and as such get more people\nInvolved in it within the party which would be good for the party but you know that you're still not getting someone in the room that night you're engaged but you're not in\nThe room so is is that the Democrats still think that's a good thing or or or they're concerned that that kind of create an option that create some disconnected but that\nDoesn't um uh you know keep someone as involved as that otherwise would be by showing up so so that's a that's absolutely an interesting question and see what kind of impact um that after the option has ... on the party building aspect\nAaron thanks for the inside Erin Murphy is the morning bureau chief for Lee Enterprises he spoke to us from his office in the Des

presidential precinct caucuses now with Troy price chair of the Iowa Democratic\nParty we spoke at the party's headquarters in West Des Moines on September twenty seven\nWe're approaching this conversation I'm the one thing that we want to do is make sure that we preserve and protect the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and you know at the end of the day went to ... is our is you know never held ourselves out to be a primary it's a um neighborhood meetings and it doesn't matter\nHow much money you have it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter uh\nYou know who you are a everyone can come to this man and they can have a spirited debate about what the future of our country should be and that's one Cox's having them so we want to make sure that we can preserve that but with the DNC\nAnd they can have a spirited debate about what the future of our country should be and that's what Cox is having them\nAnd so we want to make sure that we can preserve that but with the DNC is asking us to do a and through the changes that were passed in August\nIs and there's several uh buckets but the ones that kind of impact us the most here in Iowa will be one or allowing for some form of absentee participation for those who will not be able to or could not attend\nTo reporting of the raw results\nFrom the first ... phase of the ... as\nA ensuring that we have a recount procedure in place so that we can if a if it's a close and if a campaign request that that we can in fact recreate what happens in the ... and ... be able to make sure that the results are accurate\nUm those are really kind of the three big buckets that we are looking at as we go forward here and the other one too is that locking the caucus night result is the final result so what has happened in years past is that you know at the county level if one side doesn't get a their folks out then it\nCan change and then it can change again at the district convention that could change again at the state convention and here\nUm the what happens on caucus night will be a is the winner and so from that point forward then everything will be preserved going up through the chain and so uh if it's projected that candidate acts gets for Delhi gets to the DMZ well then they'll get for ... so we got to work through\nIf candidate acts wins that many delegates in Iowa but doesn't make it past South Carolina doesn't make it past Florida if they released their delegates does that then open it up either for free connection or for some sort of a portion meant or am I premature in that\nI think that uh this is where the devil is going to be the details\nAnd we're also starting the process now are out doing this I'm listening post across the state department's list of feedback on how we might be able to do that and sort of thinking through this we haven't so approximately you know\nSpringtime a first part of spring to be able to figure all this stuff out or do we get selection plans written and submitted to the DMZ and so for us where you're starting that process to really\nPick up in earnest after after election day but uh but we're in the process right now starting to think through that so to answer your specific question I don't know the answer to that yet and uh\nUm other states where that has happened when we were going to go take a look at how other states have dealt with this when they have primaries for example you know in New Hampshire that have been candidates who drop out shortly after New Hampshire but they still have so many delegates that they were secure on that night\nSo we just go through that process and civil finger on exactly how to do that [noise] one\nOf the big sticking points of courses then how does Iowa State distinctive from New Hampshire and one of the concerns some had had was if you report raw vote totals than it's starting to look like New Hampshire if you have an absentee process it may be too much like New Hampshire\nThe first question is do you think that our singular identity will remain pure and secondly are the folks New Hampshire happy\n[laughter] well for us uh again uh we want to preserve the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and so we want to preserve that feeling where folks can come together and actually discussed as a\nCause it's one of the few places in politics that you can actually do that anymore and so we do want to make sure that but we also want to make sure that we're giving folks the opportunity to have their\nVoices heard um uh and for folks who may not be able to participate that's always been a challenge in years past and so we're going to take a really in earnest looking at how we might be able to make that happen\nIn terms of New Hampshire and I've traveled out there a a earlier\nThis year and I talked with our secretary of state and I stay in regular communication with my counterpart New Hampshire\nAnd so you know we will continue to work with them and make sure that you know as we're going through this process keeps them up to date and you know is there any land mines that uh or challenges that may be further down the road that we're not seeing [noise]\nMake sure that we're keeping folks in the loop on that so that for early states have always worked really well together Iowa New Hampshire has definitely worked very well together over the last Thirty years [laughter]\nFor sure and so um you know we want to make sure that we are continuing that process and also considering to work with our folks across the aisle here in the state I'm obviously the Republicans\nRepublican process looks different than ours does report raw total 'em and they do allocate their dog it's based upon that and so for us we want to you\nKnow is this is a a lot of conversations go into this process and it's\nNot something that I get to decide a or a you know you're in our FCC just unilaterally gets to decide we're obviously want to make sure that people have a chance to have their voices heard in this conversation if they have thoughts something we haven't even thought about it yet and hoping that we can salute hurt and you know here's a feedback and hair those thoughts and be able to put that out there\nTroy price chair of the Iowa Democratic party we spoke in West Des Moines on September twenty seven some final words for contacts now from former state party chair and former congressman Dave make\nWas Daniel Webster he of the dictionary fame who wrote in the federalist papers most people don't realize he was a constitutional issue before he was a a a a dictionary experts\nThat is important in the Democratic process that we talk to each other you know you put people into a room of all the persuasion of all of the candidates\nAnd they talk to each other and they have to declare their preference in public through therefore and hear why their neighbors are more for somebody else [noise]\n... that's that's healthy that's democracy it's the lowest possible political denomination you can get and I think that's important particularly if it was important before it's even more important now for the things I said we started the show is is we got to start talking to each other we got to start listening to each other\nAnd that brings us to the close of this week's program were back again next week at the same time in the meantime you can connect with us on law and I will watch dot org I'm Jeff Stein thanks for joining us and we hope you'll make the Iowa watch connection again next week\nThe connection isn't copyrighted freezing

Center for public affairs journalism which is solely responsible for its content to more information of Afghanistan including how you can contribute so high quality investigated and community affairs journalism and student training can get in you\nWell I think when you had when you look at it the two things one it's a positive because it says now we've got that alliance between a A R a North America alliance so we're back on solid ground there but\nI think more than that when you look at the agreement in detail what it really the key to agreement is that it also says that Mexico and Canada are are not going to sell\nA egg products to China under the table so that put some teeth on it so we're not having the underlying\nTrade disruption are under the table trading like we're seeing worker cell in Argentina or they're buying from us selling to China that is not supposed to happen in this agreement with Mexico\nAnd Canada so that's a\nThat's a positive but overall I think it's a win and it now onto negotiations with Japan and then that Europe on these trade and hopefully that puts a noose around China and leads to some positive there so I think that's the game as we see it\nOn rose how can people get more information from you with us commodities\nYou ... can can reach us at one eight hundred two four seven ... seven one\nThank you very much have a good weekend

now just crossing into being late for harvest and with the amount of rain we're having\nJust being late is not the issue the fear is that the quality of this grain is going to go downhill before we have any chance to get it out of the field joining me as Dustin Hoffman associate farm broadcaster here at the Iowa agribusiness radio network\nDustin you talked to Dr Charles Herbert from Iowa State university who many people hang on every word he says in this area because grain quality is his focus was Charlie St needs to happen for Iowa to have a successful harvest\nRight now Ken the the main thing he's been talking about is the fact that the corn beans more so the beans and the corn but they both\nAre are are suffering from this back and forth wet weather dry whether ... whether dry weather we've had a four of the last six weekends and I have been wet and they're talking more heavy rain events coming up in the forecast\nAnd he's saying right now with the ground not drying as fast and being over saturated he said the best thing that could happen for Iowa for corn and soybean harvest would be to have a bruising frost\nUh to to get rid of some of the green stems and there and to to knock out the weeds and and and some of the ground because if he said when you have a frost you know the texture of the ground changes a little bit and you can actually still get a combine across the ground when it's a little went as long as it's frozen till it's not so much but at least they combine can move\nYeah the only interest right now is to get this crop harvested um what about soybeans one is this wet harvest going to do to them well\nRight now the what he's looking at is with again that wet and dry weather back and forth is going to put a lot of stress on the pods making them more brittle\nHe's afraid that we could be running into a problem with pot splitting and beans falling on the ground and unless you want to go through the bean field of the shop ... once they're on the great aunts or on the ground there there's nothing more you can do there\nHe's also worried about the uh the event of of some molding in the beans and as you said there was a what a what year in two thousand nine and we didn't see molding on the beans\nBut he's saying right now the way things are shaping up we could be setting up for that so he said right now we're going to look at some higher moisture means when you are are are harvesting but he's saying right now if you can get in beggars can't be chooses go in and get them as soon as you can\nI Know farmers are trying that but they've got some land that they are going to have to wait water to get into it for a while what impact does is going to have on corn\nOn corn right now as the especially in the in the northern regions of the state where we saw a lot more water or you know you already have some weaker stands with the rockets and and now you have corn that is has matured and ... and his and his died and now the stocks are starting to decompose and starting to rot\nAnd you're going to have the problem with more snap especially if you have more strong thunderstorms again where you have higher when it's going to be a big problem\nAh you know the the the stocks just aren't that strong and then you have grounds that are in the southeast as he said two words Ben dry and you get all that rain or that will cause some problems as well he's also worried about the ... the instance of\nA bummer toxins especially in the northern region to said southeast could see some but he was more worried about the northern regions the longer that corn sets and especially if it gets on the ground or gets lower because the humidity on the ground out of that could be a problem and he's really encouraging farmers to go out and started scouting\nAnd seeing what they're finding and if they're finding something unusual to talk to us and crafts people\nIsn't is a shame you grow this big ear of corn and you want to harvest it but Mother Nature won't let you and that era of corn than with a stock that's deteriorating basically takes it down and you lose it all\nYeah and we know we've been talking you know you get all these forecasts from NASA and all these places\nWhere they are they talking record soybean crops and and high high yields and corn and you know all of that as well and good and and the markets love it and it's good information for for future is forecasting but when it comes down to it none of that means of thing until you actually get that green into the ban\nA Charlie always has advice for people on this or did he have advice on what to do once you get the grain out of the ...\nHe said the best thing to do is get it dry and get a cold as fast as you can it's getting better for

Hi\nGood morning and welcome in commando show\nReturns next Saturday morning at nine\nThis is a prime opportunity for the un I football team they're ranked number twenty two when the country coming off back to back shot out and have not allowed a single point in nine consecutive quarters\nThey've had a few extra days off sense there last game and while today's opponent is top ranked defending national champion North Dakota state is the first road game of the year for the by said and they expended a lot of effort last week you know lasting then number three South Dakota said Twenty one Seventy\nDo the Panthers have what it takes to take down the nation's number one team will find out soon enough kickoff less than two hours away and will join Gary rhyme and a half the unit dome and high knew\nThat the answer is open the Missouri Valley football conference season ten days ago shouting out Indiana State at Terre Haute driver I wanted to lead the way for you when I was one hundred eighty yards rushing and two touchdowns while Eli done was sixteen for twenty four for two hundred and Eighteen yards passing\nDefensively the Panthers closed down that second straight shot out when Duncan for each returned an interception Nineteen yard for up expects touchdown and the fourth quarter\nFor the second straight home game the wind weather has forced the closure of the outdoor panther

Taylor as well\n[noise]\nIt's always good when you can start the conference football season with a when it's even better when you can take on the nation's number one team on your own home turf exciting stuff Gary rhyme is so what do you expect that the answers primed for this one\nI tell you what caught some confidence in momentum going into this game on Saturday against the number one ranked team in the country and not only the number one ranked team in the country with North Dakota state coming in but the defending national champion how many times in any sport\nDo you play on your home turf and it's the defending national champion of that sport coming in so that that's pretty cool they won six of the last seven they bend the team to beat in in ... not only the Missouri Valley conference\nBut they've been the team to beat in MCS football for a number of years but I think this panther team\nComes into this game Saturday with kind of a renewed confidence some momentum\nThey they the defenses shut out the opponent nine quarters in her role gotta go way back I think two thousand and eight cents panther defense did that\nGot their hands full on Saturday North Dakota states off then says really good lead by another quarterback that they're talking about as an NFL prospect in eastern sick but I I\nLike the way the Panthers were playing I think made some good adjustments over the first four weeks and an after shutting out Indiana State or this ... a week ago Thursday and having just a few extra days to rest and he allowed I kinda liked the way this thing's all coming together for the big match up against the bikes and\nWhat are some of the keys that will need to watch early on to help us determine whether or not this panther team can play with the level of the Boston and I said the level of because they as you note they've banned that demonstrated team and as I heard you talk with a guest on retro earlier this week North Dakota state\nScattering their success after you win\nDemonstrated team and as I heard you talk with a guest on retro earlier this week North Dakota state had earned their success after you went on it and its previous success so what are the Panthers need to do to have the master come back to the topic\nI really I think what I'm going to say is pretty basic but if you're going to beat North Dakota state\nWe have to mount some kind of running game with are often they're run defenses outstanding they make you one dimensional I think one reason you and I was so good\nOffensively at Indiana State was because we found the running game and that helped open up the passing game a really great job of running the football by Trevor Allen\nBacked up by Marcus why Miller the often see blind was outstanding so good the ... one of the Lyman was named the MPs you often see blind men of the week but I think watch early if the Panthers were able to run the football if if we become one dimensional and it's the only way we can move is through the year I\nThink it makes it a little bit tougher to score and then the defense I\nI don't know if you're going to shut North Dakota state out nobody does that\nBut the defense has to continue to get stops and get off the field one thing in recent years against North Dakota state that's really hurt us\nThey seem to always convert the big third downplay to keep drives a lot eastern stick did that last Saturday in their win over third ranked South Dakota state he ran for six first downs four of them were on a third downplay we can't let that happen\nSaturday if you want to beat North Dakota state when when you get him in a third in top down and distance situation gotta get off the field\nGet that defense on the sideline let him rest up and turn it over to the ... but it north it's easier said than done Jeff North Dakota state has been the number one team in ... yes football for I think the last four or five years of time of possession because they do have a good ground attack\nThey do grind out long drives they got to play action past\nThey got to do all threat quarterback\nSo it it's tough to stop them but I think watch for that can the defense\nStay out of a long drive or North Dakota state puts together ten eleven twelve Thirteen play drives in just wears you down if if the panther deep bench can get off the field and hold up I think we're in for a just a tremendous football game\nAnd you can't get behind against a team like North Dakota state you're gonna have to prove yourself early because you're going to be asking the officers to do an awful lot if they quickly become and fourteen Twenty one points behind\nYeah ideally you want to have the lead on these guys because if North Dakota state does get a a lead and if it's a to score lead they will just they'll just time consume it they'll grind it out they'll run the clock will just try to put together a\nResistance and rescue photographs by Judy Ellis click when it's open through November

is getting ... mark Morris [noise]\nGets brand new it's based at the University of northern Iowa was you'd accused center\nIn downtown Waterloo and on the Cedar Falls campus and it's only a real problem is is that its members will remain connected\nThroughout late high school and all the way through college with the same advisor they met when they first entered the program it's called the panther promised program three P. for short and you'd a cue executive director Robert Smith says it's big\nBetween October in a few days to know November\nWe're looking at approximately two thousand students are just this fall alone would get a chance to come visit University of northern Iowa and see how beautiful it is campuses and then we're estimating probably anywhere from eight hundred thousand students in the spring of ... we're going to bring on campus so\nWe're in just a pain bringing about three thousand students are to this camp is so that they get a chance to really look at the opportunities that the University of northern Iowa has to offer them\nMany of the three pay participants will be from lower income families and may never have set foot on a university campus before simply because no one else in the home has gone to college or even thought it was a possibility so what about the intimidation factor I wanted to know\nHere's the thing is so unique about University of northern Iowa it sells itself I mean really it's amazing when people get a chance to visit that campus people fall in love with him and and because it's not huge is not\nReally big so a lot of the small community kids as coming in kids coming in they really fall in love with the cameras because University of northern Iowa you really feel like it's a community it's it's so it's a community people talk to you uh people are friendly we just got to get a lot of these kids on the campus\nAnd so rarely we we we find that you know young people are overwhelmed they they're just more excited that the ideal they got to get on his campus and they get to see it and we're also brings some kids are from the Davenport school systems\nAre so whereas me right now we're scheduled for high schools to come down and put\nA no we have a couple of schools that are becoming from Des Moines so people are really getting excited about getting their kids here are and the staff that we've talked to are so excited because you're not has such a great reputation of doing a very good job of educating you know in this community and so\nWe think we're going to get the reaction or that we typically get when people have an opportunity to come here\nJust because the word panther is used in un eyes promotional materials for three pay and even though the program is based on the concept college coaches used to develop relationships with their players Smith says it has nothing to do with sports per se\nThis has nothing to do with athletics and just the concept is a model that athletic shoes the athletic department has nothing to do with the the athletic peace comes in that because I was recruited as a student athlete and so I Know how important relationships are because athletic departments recruit a lot of first generation low income\nKids and yet\nGraduation rate has shown historically there's a reason why athletes historically have higher graduation rates in a big part of it is because of the relationships and the and the retention part of it and that model that they use\nThis as strictly academics\nBut we're just using that athletic model the recruitment in terms of the relationship like coaches do so our our staff that were hiring for this understand that relationship is one of the most valuable piece is to make this program works and so when they recruit them they'll be available for them on campus to help them as well\nSince many of those in the program we'll be pro lower income households what do you tell them about the growing cost of a college education\nThat's the beauty of having them to come years because part of the tour of the campus is we have our missions offices and you know we'll be talking about what scholarships are available what the criteria is our and a third of the first generation low income students because of a bunch of three people we can weigh in\nAnd what scholarships are available what the criteria is our\nAnd under the first generation low income students because of abundance repeat we can weigh the missions fame\nSo when they come in a plot they all apply for free because of their income status and that first generation low income status so when they come they will know what scholarships available what opportunities the University of northern Iowa has to offer\nAnd then getting them here on campus at now we can then follow up later on and provide even more information so that they can ... you know sit down and see how all that works you know for them to come to the university\nFor more information yeah McCall\nThat can give me a call Robert Smith a two seven three four seven seven too and I'm sure there'll be more information or people probably have more questions about it it's a new program and we're also there we will have some opportunities some some space on campus because I think that's the really uniqueness is that the people that are recruiting these kids\nOf big tournaments some opens and uh what do you use those four as as the panther head coach what are you hoping that the team is able to do it or you're going to have some wrestlers that are wrestling on attached and and the chance to see them in many cases in their first collegiate vouch\n... what's the big picture when you're when you're taking the whole group to one of those events\nI'm like you said being able to see everybody a veto see all of our guys even are young guys compete I'm getting the guys see multiple matches um and just kind of really get the season kicked off or you know I we tried to get some tools early in the year and they said just just struggling to be able to get\nTeams in and you know people are falling here and there but um you know we'll go to those those two events I'm not sure if we'll have full full slate at each one of them um you know some are older guys they don't necessarily need to rest on to to open event some you know kind of play that by year and then we have a couple of ... and then you know the the Las Vegas is\nWas last year it was the best tournament by far just the deepest in in season tournament um so you know we'll get guys kind of gear up for re towards that but just I like I like me and I'll see all of our guys out there together like seemed to be able to see our young guys 'cause you know there'd be a few tournaments were on the road and they're going to be out and being so she's getting to see everybody and and\nLike I think I'd get jumping into that a little bit you know we have a lot of practice time be on the map somebody else in a different St Louis so\nI'm you know that's those are two other events do from for our home fans you know be able to get ... is in the far being able to get over to the point I'm so even though we won't be at home 'til the you know the you and I open you know there'll be opportunities for fans to be able to get out and see just students you know small small drive down thirty five so\nOne of the unique things about wrestling a as an outsider or looking at it is the fact that you have\nTrue freshmen who are going to be red shirt and but they're also competing uh that's that's a really interesting dynamic uh what's what's that like as a coach knowing that they're they're developing and they're getting some opportunities that other athletes who are red shirt and don't have\nUm you know I think it's ... if you saw this year with football there they're going to allow them to be able to play like in four games and not burn their red shirt I'm you know our guys I think\nJust being able to have that opportunity to compete with guys or maybe older you know I mean they might get to go wrestle the right guy but just you know see where they're at and and for us maybe maybe you know ... to meet all Richard anybody till you get to the big tech ... tournament anyway you know so having those guys prepare to be able to go through that\nUm I Hope that they changed the rules like I Know that they didn't put by I I Would love to be able to have some some are young I used to be able to have that opportunity to go out and compete\nIn our saying let in in in that stuff and not burn their Richard\nI'm I don't know if that's going to change\n'em or not but I think it would be a great and you know with wrestling if\nYou get somebody herself I get somebody heard at one twenty five and and I got a recipe ... ugly effort to matches\nAnd then it burns rhetoric doesn't make sense to us either so I think it can fix a lot from maybe a sometimes some open waits for teams because I don't want to I don't want to use a kid's year maybe the says her and he's gonna be out a few weeks but [noise]\nI Know we've got now I've got to forfeit um so I I think that they'll change some of that I don't know if that's exactly the kind of when the subject a little bit but they've but they've changed some of those rules with football this year so it's a I think it's a great thing that kids will have that opportunity won't necessarily bring their red shirt and and we can see them on competition so we've been able to do that for a while\nYou know we can go see a guy in a couple of terms you and I they can even go to ... or the ... and then well Davis has one of the best cat in the country we are going to you know we're gonna be able to put them in there so we definitely have the prime where you need perspective\nUm and see how ready guys are maybe more than some of these other because you know basketball they put them out there than than they burn it but I think I think I think it's going to change all across\nAnd and see how ready guys are maybe more than some of these other because you know basketball they put them out there than than they burn it but I think I think I think it's going to change all across hopefully all the college athletics I think it's a good move well\nLet me go to the other end of the spectrum was so much experience coming back and with so many wrestler she went to Cleveland last year for the national tournament I remember hearing your comments I remember hearing from some of the wrestlers that ultimate result they're at the national tournament was not what any of the mole for I don't think but\nHow have they use that how they take a nap during the off season what are you seeing now six months later seven months later ah that that that has the push them towards achieving this year\nI think you know when I talked about seeing how they going to be seen if they have the weight of the world on them or they like man I'm prepared and ready and I'm just going to go to fly you know some as anything we get too caught up into into the result in something that maybe we can't control so you're talking about you're talking about then said tournament in Pittsburgh\nWell I mean I'm working for that but I can only really take care today like sometimes I get too far I get working too far ahead and then we'll start spin and we used we used a lot of energy and things that we can't control so we're trying to really get guys they control the effort and focus and in in\nThe intensity that they have in in workouts and how they take care of their life outside the here and do that every day and then in the end those those results will come but I think guys guys you know they they learn they learn from those experiences may put too much pressure on themselves or\nOr maybe just too tight but that\nSome of that stuff is just a\nI think you have to experience some of those things to be able to really understand you know a guy like maxim places that are freshmen then he doesn't places sophomore in men it's an incredible learning experience for him and his use it that way to grow and get better I think that's how I felt like all the guys used it after even after the tournament it was ... when none of it was like put my head down and feel sorry for myself was like\nMan I put this on me and then orders coaches we tried to put it on us do what can we do better to have these guys more prepared what how are you know what were some of the movie what were some of the ... maybe shortcomings that we felt we had we're we're not as prepared and ready where I got you know those things as coaches we look at too and there's no point the finger at them because\nWe asked on that point the finger at themselves but is think being able to use these guys they experience and be able to go through and then you know having guys that have place and we have three guys back that have been somewhere on the stand\nYou always had seven guys that have been to the tournament they're not going to be overwhelmed by anything they're they're they're ready to be the best kind of the country just now it's where they believe in which we tell them all the time now it's just them really believe in when they step on the mat and that you know\nWhen when Pittsburgh comes around\nI guess what I'm trying to get them to not focus on Pittsburgh I'm trying to get them to focus on\nWhat's in front of them right now and do that as well as possible and then I'll send you you do that for you do that for a month or you do that for a year then\nYou know a lot of times those results they have a tendency to take care of themselves because\nA man I Know all those guys want to win and do the effort that they're putting in and just that's just now it's just too it totally believing that they're as good as anybody you know there's there's some guys right now the [noise] you know you look at rankings in those things I mean everyone looks at him I mean we got a guy wander weights him and he's beat the guys are a number one right now he's already beat that guy\nSo you're you're you're the best kind of the country it's just you go out and showing
