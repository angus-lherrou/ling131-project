that's it\nBut I but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because asylum to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political pressure is that these people are not politically oppressed this there is no such thing\nAs economic asylum solely political asylum and so if you come here for the good news for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just come here to to you know to you know to you know on yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people\nA word water than their

don't speak English grooms\nNo they don't want their backyards yes there are private private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from a ... has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden on the system\nIf you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in ... and it's it's just absurd let's let's I Wonder if\nThat's the other thing Trump the rabbit hole and the Republican Party and anybody concerned about the role laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go through the process\nI Know they don't want to do that some of them I don't have time it's too dangerous in my home country but that's not you know that is not a justification for asylum because your country

for the rest of the country you're\nListening to the lower income show eight five five forty Laura remember the facts we brought you\nA last week about how black\nVoters and Hispanic voters in the last CBS a Hugo poll on this which was in June kind of at the height of the family crossings family separation issue\nOf the workers that were poll by the CBS poll forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nFifty five fifty eight percent of white voters said the same thing sixty seven percent of Republicans sixty one percent of independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters a said they want their congressional candidates to talk about immigration a lot\nThat's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who supports curbing immigration levels\nThat's a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the level should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter of what we allow in legally now\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand combined that makes them a majority at least fifty percent or they want to cut of oh at least fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an\nIncrease over the current one million people they allow into the country legally the most people just don't know if people you know in the country doing other things maybe they're not listening to the show they're not they're not on these topics but suddenly they say why things seem to be changing around here\nI mean now you have to let you have to know Spanish to get certain jobs in certain industries\nBy the way one of the guys they interviewed on the ah\nThe thing I tweeted out last night in the LA Times article that that's in the LA Times today one of the guys the interview said well I ... I expect to be getting a job in construction very soon well of course why ... unscrupulous builders hire people coming to the United states who claim they have a skill\nAnd who are then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs\nBut you think you're getting like this great these great artisans or coming in and doing like the craftsmen building oh please\nGive me a break um we're not calling in a caravan any longer a boat but Bob Bob Bob Let's go to Mike Lines to Mike real quick ten seconds\nOr you know I'm a when you just talked about on the African American conservative but when you just talked about the African Americans are ... or ... illegal immigrants these jobs are African Americans who\nAre taken over by legal immigrants and and we're all the trouble for that\nWell good ... gets spread the word Mike spread the word in your community with a lot more to get to coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\nUse\n\n\nThe ... not an actor but a real life story from ... new debt management and I had a lot\nIs your view on this [noise]\nYou know are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and there is a great way to come to this country and there is a long way and they are going about it the wrong way if they want to seek political asylum there is a process for doing that and we know\nThat it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agent said talk about the necessity of doing that and I think it's in the ... that we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico to make certain that they're border is secure in this air protecting their sovereignty book cause\nThis is not something that you know people entering by force is not something that we should\nView as being unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo the bone spurs and do this you know\nTake no prisoners very personal way of looking at the world for good at it and so people that's why I'm not\nSure you want to move forward makes a compromise is trying to get some solutions for immigration from our bureau big issues with one of them would be real blue shirt and people were more\nOh here's a had eight years of Obama what did they do the math of our healthcare system and we did catch and release yeah so what is he talking about like well\nYou know this is this is going to be language that you hear from liberals when they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continue to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\n... freedom has an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's sovereignty and\nProtecting our borders securing the southern border or sitting my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to fifty one files and\nIllegal aliens he they tend to see a haven for illegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but that's just the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater I fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them\nThose certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think Phil Bredesen is somebody there at the border welcoming download giving them\nA state issued id and of course we have the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes\nOpen up our borders so I'd say like stand firm on this essay what makes certain bases care of and now they cannot just come walking into our country and receiving benefits Tennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs\nWith drug traffickers sex traffickers human drive tractors and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from\nRural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down south West Virginia or illegal immigrants there uh again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash\nA and this undermines us a worker or of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond set up with us and how it has to stop\nA congresswoman Blackburn what what will you are in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSwearing away and didn't do anything which I'm personally live it about this there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise] well you're\nExactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get to send it to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people that that is and executive them a program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it daily and go with those issues funding the wall I Am so putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know large ... walls work anybody doubts that don't talk to Israel\nLong work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by the illegal alien who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is a dead she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico\nAnd this is not it's it's not right and for the families they want to see justice they'd want to make certain that we do eat verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West Tennessee I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar say a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his sons to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nLeft homeless and yeah\nAnd then he and his son go in and do it right but he said you know in these big jobs for he and his sons to keep their Mason growing business [noise]\nAnd do it right but he said you know England these big job so he and his sons to keep them they simply does well in in the or to keep it growing again and so\nThese are real issues and what I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue\nThey see it as a security issue that can the border secured every child support or to him every state supporter state and it's fine to fraternal order of police has endorsed to me and my grandson tough on crime tough on trafficking\nTruck got tough on the drug issues the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue they see it as an issue that affects them and their community against the law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community\nAnd again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on the floor and grim show we've hit\nThe issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by a record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in this mid term cycle of that is a music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them\nIncluding on trade and all and the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a they I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade the meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll\nA congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focus tax cuts take on China get more manufacturing at home and it's working\nWell it is working and I'm not a fan of ... like free and fair trade and\nAnd the west Tennessee where I Am right now well our our farmers showers sleeping Congress or credit concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China a trade war on us for decades\nCongress on how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so\nWhat they will say is if we're in a war\nWe got to be sure we win this war and it brought us what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price that that is tough on China they then scaling our intellectual property in reverse engineering it's very hard and hiking American Jobs and our owners will say\nHey we got it but we've got to have some great leaflets sure when this trade or and that we open up markets today are encouraged by the U.S

they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in afterwards gaping\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political\nParty pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing in the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene pointed damage to the American people will realize their mistake electing Trump Republicans I'm couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually in midterms the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got maybe a narrative is that a gigantic blue wave was going to happen\nAnd we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started type thing and then he began to look\nAt me they won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain a seat in the Senate and\nOh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN zone poet forty four percent\nRafts my son has trumpet fifty one there is nothing happening that suggests St blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one\nI think as we get closer to the moment of truth I eat election day people have to start reeling in these Madden cat predictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can\nFor the sake of their business there in the polling business is they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all if that's the case who hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little man it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans in hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house\nWith a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out now all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not idle thinking if they ever did that\nI don't think he ever did exist I think it made up manufactured you don't get the poll result you want depending on when you take the fall and who you decide to put in your sample\n\nThere is no way there is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion\nAnd your sample there is no way there\nIs simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to them in the American people are not there the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nDon't do your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people going to say yes and yet\nTake a look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression there's a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there Thursday hungry way to make sure we have so much they have so little\nWe mark what the that's not a position it's going to win the election if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump never gotten the Republican nomination if the people\nOf this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted in the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump won I never got the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go stuck\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they won and let them yet and we should pay them wishing house than they have nothing to report are coming from ... countries left them that's not\nA majority opinion of the United states the media is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build the wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote
