Republican shit finally grown aback bowl\nOh that's very interesting ray you know I I don't know if that's right or not it John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabinet shop a prior to his death that I think if he had not a God Neal if you if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think he would have supported a cabin or [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always a big question mark you you never knew when he was gonna go rogue and and the band and his party I thought he was bigger than his party\nOr an ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing Obamacare evil or to keep it and and apparently he did that just out of spiked a because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over ... over his time and this that he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think the the the person with respect to what your theory might have the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham eulogy grab was always the junior maverick er he was always ah he was always John McCain's a wing man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nAnd they maybe will find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moment a thanks for that call re if if if you want to be hurt eight five five forty Laura is the number to call\nYou know I wrote a post on a power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here\nSo I wrote a post on a power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here and it's got a lot of attention and it was a link to unreal gr politics a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand a people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that post than about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post that where do we go from here\nOr by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history the Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right that's a pause there for a moment the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted that lied about but they but they did at least purport to relate just thinks he might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that uh Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nWas involved in in gang rapes as a high school student believable or the smears that they the slander as they they directed against ah against judge Canada\nSo I continued uh but this land or the Democratic party directed toward cabinet were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years to come\nAnd I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact that we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore above the cabinet nominations you at ... at a\n\n\nTime share honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract for the next set of fees contact resort released today\nIf one isn't going to get angry about that I'm not quite sure when when one way to get angry and I am quite confident that if you had remained calm and robot like that the response would have been well clearly he must have done the things that he was accused of because somebody who was truly get it said what would have been\nA ... to this and what have shown that a by you know paid a little angry in responding to those charges so I really think the damn defeated and damned if he did it the twenty four hundred a walk professors\nOr you might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Newman a leap into this when everything else failed a hardly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps\nA dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that was going to have not the slightest I doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left\nAnd that more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nGuy I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned now Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when the cabinet or cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that not to show people he was he was sincere and I and I pocket and that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was your emotional during her testimony and came across as they used to\nAnd whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now ask me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would've been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly as strongly as he did and said you are now trying to destroy\nA a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served judges and I'm not going to play along with this I I think that he he very much help his uh his cause and had he come out and being\nAt a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm the Heritage Foundation John let's look forward a little bit to talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the reduction or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact\nTrying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped felt in that regard because it's involved itself in more and more social issues that frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people\nBut you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that\nBut ... before the presidential election you had with Peter Berg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she thought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to decide cases over the last two terms involving administration and coke policies\nNobody was filing recusal motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed the kind of outrage courts her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing at the beach west\nTowards Brett Kavanaugh who all after all only challenge the tactics of a few senators on the Democratic side judiciary a committee you know it ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will shortly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach Brett Kavanaugh but being very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives after\nHe would be impeached and then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office\nAnd there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh will be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but as the\nThe Democrats who showed up as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and ... and and all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so crazed I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do is roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that\nThere with with Kevin Rose confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of Robie way to actually being a overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since his election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton\nSo I think you would get a large amount of this regardless well versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will uh for folks are on the left they had been predicting the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court ah starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to reaffirm\nA wrote the opinion that reaffirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter and Anthony Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court a would do when roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited in overturned\nMy prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be out right over conned than it will be that more restrictions placed on uh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld that's\nHow cases that tended to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you have states it would have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of it is full frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the corner I have no idea exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative toward along with overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the program we're going

have shorter being murdered a this is somebody who\nYou know wants to continue or sluggish involvement with this guy a and and we have other examples of that a girl who uh\nConspired to evade or friends in order to go have sex with this guy that she'd been making out with um during a dorm party she sent him a message saying do you have a condom\nLeah let's just pause on this for a second this is an accidental college Southern California\nAnd and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking beer niche and and this this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up\nWith this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and as you said one of the things she Texas okay do you have a condom and he replied yes and she text back\nGood give me two minutes since so you know you never ... follows and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reason and now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom it's going to show me as willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trust with this con demise guy uh she sent the message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now\nSo many guys that receives these messages is going to perfectly rationally and accurately assume that he has\nAffirmative consent from his partner and yet\nOccidental college who is under enormous pressure from the Obama administration they want it to rack up as many male scouts as possible in its feminists crusade to basically white males out of

boy how we're I'm sure the boy checks to her how do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies your grades [laughter] and then of course after the fact she says I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\n[noise] yeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes as I described in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nCompletely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses\nThe first survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at this magazine a\nForty three percent of the females homes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that his behavior that is completely\nIn on thing couple if you have actually been raped you art that is that most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant for from this violent criminals you do not go on to voluntarily have decks again and and\nThe the key to this whole whole hoax is that\nThe numbers that we have on a ledge campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves that same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine when the researcher asks\nThe girls who she classified as rape victims whether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not show the ... the phony campus rape epidemic\nA conceit depends on\nViolating one of the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she has been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know whether there's this ... couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows him to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be rape\nAnd then that they combine that with this with this idea they're trying to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet and hearing that any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask for their matches up with the known facts you can cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe\nAnd and as you may know whether I spent forty years in the courtroom okay\nAnd and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know uh\nMost witnesses or don't lie in almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie but but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as men and for the same reasons\nAnd and I saw this video allergy that somehow women are are you know camp you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nSo again let's let's go to remember where the city elegy is coming from it is coming from the campuses\nAnd it's part of a much broader assault on on western civilization it is based on the idea that that America\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of in gimmick racism and sexism that the world is divided into permanent victim classes in a press your classes and it's a very highly competitive\nWorld the victim world it is a ruthlessly competitive totem pole that is constantly being rearranged we thought\nThat maybe gays or at the top now trans people are at the top but they they're put decision there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that's going to get claim top dog victim status\nBut but females you know we started there early on\nYou in the next year or two that's going to get claim top dog victims status but but females you know which started there early on\nAnd and they claimed that they are victims of rate of sexism this is preposterous it is it is for postures particularly on

culture that is is sending nothing but negative messages that them uh and you know why why bother in the world where everything that you've accomplished is it the values but it's you say the court room\nYou know the reason that we the western tradition developed these truth finding mechanisms like cross examination was with the understanding that human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate\nIt's very hard to remember things there's implanted memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know with this Christian Ford\nWhat her therapist was doing to her ...

congressman the threats are what we saw on television and I'm sitting here wondering where is the attorney general\nAmong other congressman trips or what we saw on television and I'm sitting here wondering where is the county journal where is the part of justice surely by now are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nYou know there was a headline justice more I got I have not had time to follow up yet I saw when I was on the air here where\nSomebody from the other side is is talking about how um people were being paid to show up and engaging mob action in Washington in this most recent go round\nYeah I don't know whether the G. O. J. is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing this stuff and some kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the chief of police in Seattle and you've got antifa saw\nA rioting in your city smashing store front you know breaking up a\nPlaces of business are hitting people over the head of the baseball bat and um and the two by fours\nAnd and setting cars on fire you don't have to wait for ah for\nFor a sessions or the department of justice prosecute them arrest them put them in jail and if you're the the district attorney in Seattle throw the book at them you know these people deserve law in jail terms a big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats\nAnd the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know there are the\nKind of like the provisional wing of the IRA back in the old days you know that's that's the activist wing of the militant wing of the Democratic party they don't want to prosecute them they don't want to put them in jail\nAnd ah so I think that's where that's where the enforcement really needs to be again is that the state and local level or the crimes are taking place let's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened to house in eleven in Wisconsin with the newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give union members that choice public union members that choice in paying dues you remember the hundred thousand protesters ...\nOr the country over the capital was terrible\nYeah they actually kept inside the state capital [noise]\nAh they threatened a Republican legislators um they came to boxes were sent to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it's scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons a Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot\nAh there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about it Governor Scott Walker he ... the Republican\nGets scale brothers who control the state Senate state assembly\nStood strong the governor is strong and the book is called on intimidated and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd the people just to Wisconsin ... there was that attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of wake county's lawsuit everything you're saying now\nA happen in two thousand eleven against a successful Republican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin I'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt\nA shield annoy us you know the Democratic legislators ran in ... so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that\nRight man right\nThey hit out and of course the Tea Party exposed where they were hiding in northern Illinois I in a hotel it was just you know you couldn't carry out a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process\nAnd by the way organizing for America and the Wisconsin branch was busy there that was Obama's group thousand eleven act in a while\nAnyway I show you may you make a great point I

Thirteen were reasons why everything that happened in that series a from the gang rapes Tuesday drinking everything and it also happened to a very prominent kid in that are in that series\nAlright who knows you maybe you're right we got to go to a break we'll be joined by guess Adam ...\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado reading about the brand new Gen you sell sunspot correct or she says she loves it it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age Boston can see a definite difference in her skin since using it\nAnd now a President Trump is really fulfilling his his promises a to pursue policies that lift the middle class that left people all across America not just on the east coast and the west coast\nIn particular that give opportunity to people starting out at the bottom of the totem pole is really striking I think how successful his policies have been\nI I agree I think the way a third of as an economist I knew that uh that that tax reform was good for the economy that regulations were at work drag on economic growth but uh it's been it's been incredible to see how how transformative some of these reforms can be it a bit just\nUnleash ing the power of businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is that is really a transformative across the board\nReally is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking bases are currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump was fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings but he's had 'em and and a strong approval rational causes the approval index the difference between stronger approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero doesn't it doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven\nSo Trump's at at this moment is eleven point better so we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something a ... what do you think that um are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some a beach\n[laughter] you know I think it's a it's all the above it both things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future uh it it really is a stark discrepancy between\nThe two futures that are are in front of us are right now that uh that that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan repeal Trump tax\nCuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it needs but the average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax cuts that was asked last year and the economic growth projected over over the future attacks because there are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of\nLast take home pay that that that sort of typical American and expect that uh\nThat that that that should be scary to to most Americans that they all of this prosperity could be\nA could be reversed with the er what by simply repealing somebody's big pieces that that the house and the Senate and have have put through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions enemies stops to answer their questions\nAnd there's a bunch of questions about the cabinet nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he's talked about Venezuela\nAnd he said yeah if the Democrats get their way all these socialist they're popping up now that they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes and instead one after another they're coming out as socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela now you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pets have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\nThe the the record of socialism or something like eighty six in zero it the way it's been tried more times than it should have been and each and every time\nIt's a it's it's crumbled and then left misery and destruction at wake and so that mean that the that that at a very high level that those are the two that your direction because we can shoot\nThe promise of the tax cut the promise of\nOf putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how they're on the bench rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington and letting it starts flopping around line people's pockets and then a parts of it yet ... bad back out elsewhere if\nThat is just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American than American businesses do\nBad back out elsewhere that are just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American than American businesses though how best to spend that invest their their resources and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American uh you know under socialism some people always do very very well so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so that if you're part of the ruling click or you're you're a part of the end the socialist in crowd yeah you could do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats so they can fry 'em up for dinner that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially\nToward the bottom of the economic ladder

were a lot of things that were left unsaid and I thought I had a even the playing field because there was very unfair to judge now I can very nicely said justice cabinet are there was a very unfair situation though I\nEven the playing field that once I did that a dart at this Dale through it was very very unfairly\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in the Saturday papers well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted and you're going to hear I don't know why they come from\nI don't know who's responsible for creating the motives of I think it's gender studies I think it's a combination of feminism and gender

basically they accepted a piece an excerpt from Adolf Hitler's mind comp read too old and a half terms that would be buzz words and knee jerk reaction causes to them and they ended up falling forward left\nHook line and sinker the reason why I left wing or is of doing this because they're worried that the disciplines that they trust and believe in our being shattered by a bunch of absolute gobbledygook insanity\nAnd so they have prepared a series of hoax essays and papers and presented for peer review journals of higher learning on the academy\n\nThere obvious hoaxes the anybody who knows anything about the origins of the papers that served as the basis in this case mind times\nBut this group of women accepted an essay right out of mind comp with just a couple or three words your
