I Can't help but wonder you know how you know all the comments that Donald made after he said there about how great he was in areas are very smart man and they all he gives you welcome there anytime\nA well worn down you know that being said Donald lily thanks very often what would the instead of calling you got up there and told him or or about how he was all this other stuff but he's still be a great man you know ...\nI mean we we I think we know our president well enough to know now that no the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy uh compliments if he liked what you say and heavy uh complaints of you don't so no I I think it is you you certainly of Andrew drone question there David no uh obviously uh uh what went said had everything to do with what the the president had to say in response\nAh Charlie in Manhattan, Kansas and the good evening Charlie welcome\nSir Jumo how you doing I'm well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country um ran into him all the time going back to your age maybe a little bit people don't know how to critically saying I mean let somebody else to sink in for him\nIn a one day I heard the song of the ah Internet today Eric sold it for ex President Carter\nWas a great thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA because the layout burst and the weight inducted himself and his performance ... in a hearing boy you know a he or I don't know is carbon they're ... a courtroom that a little\nBit of an old at the stadiums he made I really do one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges had been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely he would probably out Kavanaugh Kavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context\nThat Kavanaugh rode an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so [noise]\nYeah I I can I mostly I Would Jimmy Carter in the category of ah\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been moved to some extent it never was and he was a better ex president than the president so [noise] yeah I see what you're saying and I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just try and say listen show all the time on my way home from work and make far I'm actually calling on my car on that I I think what the kind of a west LA slashed scale and\nI'm an independent I ... I ... I Am an end to end and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do I think their point is they have millions of followers\nAnd they just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how to how it felt I just think that uh they just again just half a million followers\nDo they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well form an opinion based on what some celebrity says and then that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out of without question without quest that\nGreat great great but I I like I said I like I I really respect for the show a lot and then again I think that\nI think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get the vote out there now\nThat that ... in which case fan the dre how true is together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them\nProbably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that al ... a boy when you take a hit then you're in your career for something you believe in the world that's that is worthy of applause Richard in Durham North Carolina now high [noise]\nHey Jim are you doing\nI'm well thank you\nI'm a on my way home also more not\nI'll listen to you on a regular basis in a pretty shaky show I ah I Believe I've always said this to my life that\nI Believe that um celebrity have a certain responsibility when they get to a certain point of saying that they want to use their thing\nTo get into politics that's one thing where they are actually active in politics but when you have so many years the day that absolutely do not know what's going on and they ... each\nA ... year the day that absolutely do not know what's going on and they add all I eat a bowl and if they only their idols then devote a certain way that's the way they should go not knowing\nWhat the consequences of us feel that that's a long way to use you're saying\nYeah I I again ah I I think what they have to say and how they said both both does a couch a very much um so I see what you're saying it and that would be actually wagging the circumstance is good for them back in a moment\nFrom a cedar valley through the court oh\nThis is the voice of eastern Iowa New song

[noise] it is\nTime again flu season I'm so let's talk about it and just for we can expect this year with a medical officer for ... for Disease Control Dr Lisa ... cause a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season is going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it's going to be\nExact and for those who say well I was ... committed last year I was ... somebody to the twenty third team there was somebody may need to realize and that is a flu viruses are very sneaky food cheap strange regardless\n[noise] yeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year [noise]\nLook look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nHe has so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's from your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for\nMany weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um all of that\nSaid we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant above St Louis ... that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely\nTo develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um those under five years of age particularly for two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm older I said we we also know that there\nAre individuals outside of that age group for example does with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults\nCan get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than ... vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year on the two basic types if you want to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine shots are given with a needle generally\nAnd they are made either with no Irish at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all competing to make that choice ah [noise] ah other than a ... through and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ... one of the many things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status\nHow good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nUm so the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take the flu every year we were told you sure do always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flew um and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended I'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "19"}
