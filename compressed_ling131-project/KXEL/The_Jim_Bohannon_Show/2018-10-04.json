hundred countries in the world that we have to sort of a coordinate with trying to get that side of the committee to agree on what to do about cybersecurity is an incredibly tall tale especially when a lot of them are criminal enterprises themselves so these NGOs that we call them\nGet a lot of them are just a ... they have a mass kind of an engineer and really they are there are the government that they get ... by the government I mean look at how the Russian train these kids to hack at such a\nSuch a young age which is a great idea for the call hacking but it's not a great idea for unethical hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more and ethical hacking so they can do great distances that we have to have\nEthics and this is the problem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world cyber court and you start getting into politics and and and bad actors that are\nActing like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might\nLook like outsiders when really their insiders talking about Russia all day long on ... or\n... let me ask you a bit about that had been since you since you brought it up a is there any such international body there is of course a world court and there are various uh\nUh bodies of the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but didn't end up at best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests should read worst but I I Am curious if such a pug bodies even exist usually law and regulation trailed far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because they really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious plan to see that side of how we all get along come by ah I I don't want this weapon given to anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not\nMature enough for this weapon and they will take it over and they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we have nine wittingly put all our chef said one big cloud and so you can punch share that you can get a huge windfall you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything by paper [laughter] because it was harder to screw up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held accountable because the bad actors are in locations that are making a fortune outfits that\nAlone is acceptable normal something that so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you can't just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations I'll forget it a hobby that hey but it's just so far away at the ... yeah I I think the real solution is going to be technologically how I Would\nHave to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of vote will pay for is oh so twentieth century [laughter] well you know what a there are certain certain things about Tony a century that that were better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point if for example\nAh it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack and and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail rides there of how people voted\nIf somebody ... something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant ... and I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or ... well boo hoo\n[noise] well we we do have short attention span and make sure don't like the way for people that counts I don't want it to the baby out with the bathwater in technology there shouldn't be that but\nThere is got to be something there's got to be safety measures put in place so that everything's not accessible there a firewall or step bring things up their
