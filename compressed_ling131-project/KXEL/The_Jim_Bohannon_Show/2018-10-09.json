Missouri hello\nCan you know whole justice Kavanaugh\nBoat constitution past but I Want to get it to get more than ... I don't want to be ... best on the court I why Ken Pollack okay\nAnd some time that going to be happy with that all may go get something that I think by ... man I Will I Will by Bob and support it I tired this\nHorrific ah making law and then they are not exposed to that that is currently that want everybody can do their job Congress to do their job pets get their their guys and they said they shall branch to do that\nCan for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing a share and I'll just notice to today was well you look at the constitution that information constitution\nOr the house is spelled out in the constitution and the Senate the presidency of the the chief executive officers the cabinet heads and the like and then you come of course\nTo the article three of the of the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because their sense of judicial power of United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior courts as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the district courts are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those course any time it's so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also knew if you if you're still all really will judges on the lower federal courts and\nAnd there's even been some mention nothing but ... New York they had and that is a liberal democratic congressman going yeah\nAnd it it he's apparently already talking about a trend to a recall get rid of justice Kavanaugh\nOr you can only do that by impeaching him convicted\nI Know and and and just you know impeachment is just that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\n[laughter] no I'm I'm sure they do that after this appeals to the base which increasingly has has Democrats rather nervous or after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency [noise]\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house

think the gloves could easily come back off again and and what does what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't want some of these people are thinking\nWell I I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and it will take a quick break here but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared right now the below happened to them or a ... is the same as what happened to Joe Crowley

know it'd be the subject you come up twenty five years ago by making the case for the future of football there wouldn't even have been an issue\nThat's a very good question as it were got me going was it\nEverybody was taking shots at it and I felt that for my own experience my own experience as a player and as a coach administrator and from many I coached and recruited\nI felt this story you had to be told to say hey there shouldn't be a future dig age should go on I just want to get back to something very quickly generated you mentioned earlier\nYou talked about changed dropping sport or will none of them it's very interesting\nIn ... in Pennsylvania just this year there were three schools three towns because of population changes that have decided they want to maintain that football program\nAnd they'd gone to eight man football instead of eleven well you know people would say is that an indication that game was going out I said not at all as long as they're playing and they go on with the game\nWe're preserving the game so you do whatever you can do that and the other thing is I noted\nThat this year but the kick off those two thousand Eighteen college football season is a

positive that hearing surprise Arizona is a new school\n... the name of it playing at the university plane as a building block to give extra pillar curricular activity to the student base they've started the football program so there are some signs that people are finding a way to keep it alive\nAnd in the chapter six of your book first in forever uh are quoting or what you call that the coach of coaches are granted chief noting some of the the positive aspects of the game here I'll just read the for the uh the the image of a positive attitude and approach to life\nA total effort to anything I commit myself to self control of self discipline and caring for others\nUm those are pretty pretty solid point and then a very good points a\nCarrier for others I that's a good point I think to explore further or ... it sometimes seems I think\nThe the people who watch the game who may not have any close association with other than just watching a a little screen in their living room but with caring for others would be the last thing they would ascribe to football but it is a\nHard nosed to uh almost killed or be killed a winning is everything or maybe more along the Vince Lombardi line of thinking and I'm Wondering your thoughts about this notion of caring in football isn't it very much a a hard nose game\nOf of when if not at all costs at at most cost\n[noise] yeah but I think it's come to the point where\nCoaches have come around to becoming more than just\nGuys on the on the field giving you got assignment to block this guy a tackle this guy is covered this band I think they're taking it beyond that what they do with their lives with you beyond your\nFootball experience is no greater example of a caring than when you look at the chapter in here on Jack ...\nWho came in and took over a program at Marshall after they had disastrous crash that killed the entire team coaches in\nParts of the administration of applying when they went in there and rebuild program rebuilt the football program and it's a great story and Jack is a wonderful human being\nHe had a lot he got the job\nThey went through three or four candidates looking how they're going to do this and they took this guy L'Engle whose coach had a small\nCollege in Ohio because he was coming from a background where he had to live and stay and be with his players constantly small college they took a chance with Jack\nAnd he went to marshal and rebuild their program and it's a great story and he's a great story but there are many stories like that you mentioned grand theft rent is the guy that built the Baylor program from nothing he went on the head up the American Football Association for over Twenty years\nHe's giving person and that's why he talks way does\nAnd I think there's a lot of people like that and the gay and I told people\nWho quickly I tell people that you know there are a thousand coaches out there that the reason that ... just like mine because there's so many coaches that had the same influence on kids who had the same type of kids that they coached and went on with their lives to bigger and better things\nAre we in need of of\nOld competitive sport for

would come down to that\nIf it got to be so different that they only the the biggest strongest to play a everywhere or in great places I think it would be very interesting to have people who had maybe less size and less talent\nTo find a program that they could fit into because they wanted to play they leave they enjoyed it a\nYou know we talk about it sure football is a contact sport he going to
