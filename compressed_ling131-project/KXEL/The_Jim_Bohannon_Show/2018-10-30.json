I Would do too I I Would to David's point also say this is that um I have spoken to some congregations are her from congregations that say\nEven if they the option of an armed guard were were viable for them which in many cases it is\nSome of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've ... related to terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving in clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the the the imagination and into your first point Jim\nHardening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there\nAre I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certainly preferred to do that than it is to station the armed guards if if if David concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a an armed guard there are a hardened target you know\nPut the overlay of a hard target in an armed guard there I'm suggesting of all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least seeks to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside of there so\nUh you know on the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is\nWe we we have hardened targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse ... you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\n... when you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot scene and unseen things that go along there that target as hardened as well too so let let's not parts too much on the word hard ... you know harden means to to shore up to to defend where otherwise it hadn't been defended to strengthen to make more

right uh suffice to say that uh\nThere are there are things that you can do out there there's not a case of somebody throwing up your hands and uh and say do nothing nor is is the notion of trying to instill good will and people a bad idea but it is certainly no panacea of people who engage in such activities are pretty much beyond that level of persuasion although\nObviously trying to reach people in their formative years is obviously something else to pursue\nAll of them of things to consider and to stay on the line Bruce we will speak briefly off the air Bruce Alexander is the

synagogues or a new public buildings are built\nThey built by security experts\nAnd they're built with security in mind it's harder to do that to old buildings but today in Europe you can't go to a
