Iran is the author of the virtue of nationalist sub is by basic books and build a we have a call from Helene she's in Inglewood Florida to joined us this evening hello and William and welcome to have you with this\nThing ah you know I think on this subject or read I think the war that stuck out for me was trained quality and as you mentioned as we had so far nation America\nThat the post and they want a nation wide it as hard as\n... and ...\nAnd testifying or the low ... issues there in the cabinet off or immigration or Republican or Democrat I'm Wondering\nWhat nation\nIs an independent state just like well they won't make\nThe law of their own maybe we should look at her own United\nStates and say OK\nCurrently I'm living in Florida because Republicans have a certain philosophy of the way they would like to see things done\nMaybe we should make Florida simply a Republican state Democrats tend to a certain way with which they like to see things done or whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we should make 'em Texas Democratic\nState and maybe if we had each individual may\nHave the Democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that handles philosophy belonging to Democrats or Republicans can limit that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell then as soon as the course of people referred me mobile and also assumes that we can simply dictate one of the state is now granted election returns may also indicate\nEr which direction of said goes but uh the notion of officially establishing something or how would you feel in Florida was determined to be the opposite of you what are you going to just pack up and leave\nI Would say that there wouldn't be more peace and tranquility in a state that whoever supported\nMe they ... they whether it be both abortion or offer abortion people would say that they wouldn't be much happier and it wouldn't be in line and much more protests get today\nWhere most people have much closer ties to locality than bad I mean he perhaps you're quite willing to move wherever whenever but other people\nHave families they have jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful if suddenly all the Republicans are in a\nA Florida in let's say we moved to Georgia or something where you are you going to do to the point of a gun I mean I mean it did just a ... honestly Ilene strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a brief society would be very simple but\nThey are much lower than they\nAre going on not these are some many or not\nYou know I mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one's individual white it's kind of like if they don't like it up north because it's cold they'll move down south\nThey can but you're talking about the forcibly moving them\nOh no I think for moving them it would be among all that they're going to be happy where they live well but\nThey're they're going to be more on happy if they if they feel like they've got to leave their their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave when the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to me well let's say that what support their values are just being or choose to be unhappy because hey\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so of again a I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution may do you draw the lessons from that to your um\n[noise] well I I I think he'll win raises an important historical point the United states was\nAs you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the ... the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character\nThat Helene is talking about so all all of us are look back in our appalled at the at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nOr had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of a character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states that just messed up if\nIf you wanted to live and that that kind of a place then then you would live in Massachusetts and Connecticut and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York and um it is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery [noise] um but but when you get to a\nWell I Will do you manage that thought but the clocks gonna make you finish it after this break [noise]\nVisual home of a un I Panthers is really the Waterloo Cedar Rapids\nNavy pilots in on it was more from the Iowa almanac in a moment\nOur country can chart its own course and the ... you can't you're not going to have England or China or Russia or anybody else and dictate what we'd do\nThe theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like so you ... you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about\nA Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well that that\nThey're not they're not being governed by the way we want them to be governed\nBut that's exactly the point the point is but\nIf if Americans going to be a nation state and national state\nAnd it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections in to tell us what to do then part partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own course and so there's a certain ah humility in that saying we don't necessarily have\nThe answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq and uh helping determinant new constitution there didn't work out so well some may may be may be America doesn't have\nPat answers for every other country should be governed\nUh obviously quite quite frankly there are some countries out there that just really aren't aren't fit for self governance and it'd be kind of a free status or culturally they are simply unprepared for that the I Wonder if some languages even have the the word compromise in them I I seriously doubt of Arabic includes the word ...\nOr because of the of the uh the the way that the many aspects of their culture a proceed so\nUh I I think that there was a much greater recall probably put this kind of thing back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we were willing to look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they have the the big\nA break out of a of a colonial is a a areas of became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we suddenly saw the the likes of Libya leading me the United Nations Human rights council\nAnd we realized that the total of ... of of the notion quite frankly I think the the the widespread growth of independent nations is probably what doomed the United nations\nBecause you you have within the United nations today what may be out of a hundred and Ninety some countries you've got maybe what\nFifty or sixty that could be considered the genuinely a fit for free self governance\nYou know most of those countries but the ones that you're saying are are fit our our country is in which there is an overwhelming majority of assert or a single national group within the country [noise] and ah the\nThe ones that are not fit are you you you're talking to a large large portions of a of a Africa and Asia\nWho overloaded look a little bit leaders higher swaths of the predominantly Arabic countries from Morocco or eastward and then once you leave by the Arabic countries just going to predominantly Islamic countries many of those are are very monolith ugly of one the culture and uh the the the armpit of the planet\nI mean the whereas the United states have relatively pluralistic place I mean\nI'm pretty sure that that's a that that is Sunni Arab propaganda if you actually take most of those countries and take a look at what's in them\nOr you'll see that they're in not at all model effect I mean in in North Africa you have thirty million Berbers who who have their own language and their own culture and our suppressed\nIn in ... countries like a ... ... Iraq and Saudi Arabia or you you have\nThirty forty fifty percent\nAre in Iraq more than fifty percent uh uh with groups that are not that we're not represented in the government for a century enter suppressed that the the ... the Shiite Arabs where the courage to thirty million Kurds\nThirty million Kurds who doesn't who were ... were suppressed in all of these countries and you can just just go on and on that there is no Sunni Arab majority\nOr other than in Egypt and in almost any of these countries and the uh the the reason that it wants to leave and he says that's certainly a a reason why they're completely on government ungovernable is because of is because of the fact that the the the people living in these countries are so afraid of one another\nA bad and the fact that they have no

school they have been carefully bred for hunting with severe hunger is numbers of years by the Austria Hungarian empire\nAh they performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high as

the circumstances that occurred so these weren't says that you're at the at great important must stand would've just those who love horses but also from the German point of view of the master race even do including\nHorses themselves as as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of these horses and they're going to have to convert German trucks\nIn order to transport them back to American lines and the in the meantime I gather that the fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat is correct to have this little outpost of the U.S army twenty miles behind the German lines\n[noise] uh the the other German troops in the area where of what's going on and most of them have stood down\n... leaving them alone however there is an ss unit moving up which has been defeated elsewhere in that coming up in groups have several hundred and laziness as some kind of a red flag
