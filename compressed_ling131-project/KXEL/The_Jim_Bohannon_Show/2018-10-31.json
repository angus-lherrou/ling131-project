I don't think the American people honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry\nWent ahead as if they you know health care system in the United states is similar to the legal system in the United states it has lots of problems our legal system has lots of problems ... and the healthcare system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other parts of the world\nWe thank God we have it because it's the best in the world right well that the\nBasically the system was demonized\nUm man that was that they were just a lot of prefer getting going on in order to achieve again the injured advised demeans the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi has engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy if the Democrat Party when we look at ... you know the terms a looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre as we've been hearing a number of things about the people uh most notably a Christians similar from Arizona Claire McCaskill of Missouri [noise] uh quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least made public in which they indicate there are a lot more to the left than the than the\nUh shall we say they portray themselves to be we have a number of people who would like to speak with James Hirsch who they lead off with David and crushed in Iowa hello David\n... or ... or ... or ... uh-huh I got to that for everybody or not\nThe gym things were you are doing a brief period uh-huh\nI got to that for everybody that are not the mayor group\nA first one is a\nAndme Lincoln to one time you spend your catch more people in some way or the party didn't solve barreled a goal and that was at first they meant the other one is that I think the ... entire Congress going to have to\nStick to hold her ...

interesting\nUm have figured out how to make\n'em or really commercial um horror films\nOn and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we review these things to be more ... are the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is so muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy\nAt home you might see mark you know might have a smile cross your face but if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh\nOut loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins and so you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sat and watched things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams uh theaters for example or get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do\nNot think so they do\nYeah does Hollywood do the kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie theater bulls in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and the and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or does the ... the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of what you'd be I Would agree yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nYou know All right yeah uh it terms of of the ... the creativity the goes to a Hollywood production and see some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days\nGo knock it to the TV shows or even this is Sara Lee feature movies just seem so to me the some of the highest levels of creativity least\nPer per second of air time if you will go into music videos and commercials\nYou know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon this film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for a second on something like a star wars and are they very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects than it is anything else\nDoes does does Hollywood depend too much on affects or we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but more we've got the great ... computer graphic or a a special effects here as long as you're on the bus gr light and magic on your side gives you some Republican anything\nIt now you can't you you can't sell it felt like anything I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into the the data side of things is to is to understand the customers want and there was a day when you could just make them moving in ... to go see it [noise]\nUm this is probably more like twenty\n... Twenty years ago [noise]\nUm but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that listen\nI from what I've experienced and I and I had a pretty you know the the kind of start with that because I think it's fair either because everything in it for every movie in Hollywood\nBut no movie no script ever starts out to be a bad movie you know and they're all gone on to win or some some game the storage\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script that you might have made to not totally confident but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so it you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects on some of our most successful movies and the ones that I Am personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... um special effect in any of those films um you know Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I I still think there's room\nYou know for those films that don't at least I Hope so because there are some of our our best stories\nHere there's an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatic you'll you'll be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of us know where you're disagree\n[noise] God is it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I don't think that\nThat is fully accurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and\nYeah I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... and a Republican household\nUm but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is how politicized\nStories had become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered politicized because there was nothing political about that movie\n... anyway a fascinating tale and we thought that on Halloween or virtually Halloween\nThat we should hear from Julie ...\nWho is a president GPA this rather just ahead of media twentieth Century Fox to talk about\nThe ghost photographer Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of may believe it is published by a treaty to lie to them and it's a it's a fascinating tale we'll be back with more in just a moment [noise]\nVisual home of and you and I thought we would eat the Waterloo Cedar Rapids\nBegging door to door more from the Iowa omen act in a moment\nEight hundred three nine o nine five to eight that eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight this call is completely confidential and if you have private insurance there could be little to no cost to you even if you already been to a treatment give them a call there is no need to let a ditch and ruin\nYour loved one's life take the first steps now at eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight\nEight hundred three nine o nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you were in a book and want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nMe handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright an editing ... eight hundred times or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author service you get that seat hundred fines or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author submission get\nAgain eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nThe national debt is now we're ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not wear socks or bonds but we've gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five NATO seven and learn how an IRA back by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now any five five eight five eighty five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eighty five eight five seven [noise]\nSome NATO the chief of\nIndonesia armed forces says the possible location on the fuselage of the crash that lying in the air jets been identified President Trump tells actually she's preparing an executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S to non citizens\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan deals Kentucky radio station W.
