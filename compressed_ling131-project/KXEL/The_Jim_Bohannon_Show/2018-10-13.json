follow me on Twitter had jumbo talks\nAs though be taking a look tonight at before coming midterm elections and some of the issues that exist up there in that particular among that group among the electorate which say first got the boat has been the least likely to vote\nAnd that is to say the millennials are and the those younger than ... particularly the ... and people of of that nature\nWill find out a bit of wire or this or this is\nA one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guest is David ... the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and publisher of the independent review David good evening\nGood evening to a gym\nAnd let's start out by taking a look at a couple of projects that you have a a instituted here are the love God love and the catalyst for or these\nWell I'm a few years ago we created a video series on YouTube to target millennials coal love go over to satire it's on liberty but it's a satire big government\nAnd what triggered this um is the fact that millennials are voted overwhelmingly both times for Obama or as you said didn't vote\nAnd the basic view that they had was the government's going to take care of them and uh the Democrats' progressive and so forth believe they had this generation and their hip pocket\nBut they want a guarantee to the lock it in but they keep on voting the office and the way they're going to do that was Obamacare if the kids to enroll him milk or become dependent on the keeper on\nVoting us in and um that was the plan but something happened on the way which they didn't expect which was you may remember that when the Obamacare website came on line it didn't work\nEven though Sanders has never said anything critical of Venezuela Cuba or the former Soviet Bloc or North Korea or what he says well we need to look at the Nordic countries the Scandinavian countries like Denmark Sweden and Norway\nAnd the claim is that these are socialist countries and they work well and people are prospering and there's a higher standard of living and so on the the problem though is that\nThe all three of these countries um basically the the property that exists the assets are owned a overwhelmingly privately about Seventy five percent of the wealth in all three of these countries is owned privately and the economy generally speaking our market based economy\nVery much so in fact is we're we're overdue for a break which we will take you are but we need to emphasize something the only way\nThat the Scandinavian countries could ever afford the extremely expensive cradle to grave kind of coverage that they have is by having robe bust\nPrivate sector is that I mean private sectors that are are far more open and free of regulation than ours are I mean that's something that people don't realize that they think that this is just some giant\nA socialist a would be paradise well some of the programs or socialistic but the economy is very private sector or they couldn't afford it or we're going to come back and talk some more what a fascinating idea finally reaching people\nWho have do a great extent withdrawn from the system I mean they they still have complains but they don't seem to know how to articulate them or to uh to uh make choices and miss in this context will come back with more from David Thoreau again his

two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nAnd you're right ... thanks seems kind of ...\nOf the of the young voters that is the group which has consistently her legs in an election out notch voted a vote but do it at the least of any any age group in the country it for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a sense of empowerment or I can do what I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard but uh it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people have an option of this country and if you don't use that\nThat a franchise or if you exercise your franchise we have trouble nobody likes of flabby franchise\nYeah I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nNow but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't you don't get involved or what are the issues you don't register to vote I vote well whose fault is it that you're powerless I Know I'm\nPart of it also is a science so that they don't they don't have specific education they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live and\nWhere to go there and it is\nBecause of the failure of the uh the the school system um and that's one of my you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth um which I think is is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is a reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on the hook for them being the questions they were asking and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects was like so to speak and the\nUh so the commanding heights of the culture and that they no longer trusted\nThe political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but uh in their case especially now I'm millennials have left for college\nAnd are starting careers and families and so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all of this\nSo they're looking for now they're even more interested in answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nA great in the series and creating catalyst and so on so our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people are Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and to give you an idea of the percentage of of ownership I'm In these countries is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to say a country like China China is just slightly lower ... northern countries and and of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just give me a further idea if you rank the um\nThe levels of private wealth\nI'm I'm like country or it turns out that Denmark his twelfth\nSwitzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth I'm North Korea is at the bottom of hundred ATF but the U.S is Eighteenth so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with the David throw us founder president and chief executive officer\nOf the independent Institute the website independent dot org you learn more about these series the love go and the catalyst one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number and we'll be back with more on the go ahead and show in just a moment\n[noise]\nOfficial home of a un I

believe that our society is grumpy you get over the years we've all adopted ... off a bridge\nUm they don't I as I said they don't trust 'em the elites necessarily to tell them how to live their lives\nAnd uh the other words on the one hand they miss educated understand history and the and the nature of an economy and so forth from the other hand there and tree by the idea of of enterprise and innovation\nUm and uh so we think that all those kinds of factors should be part of the communication strategy for this generation and\nThose questions are not that different from other people around the world um who come from different cultures how do you make the ideas of liberty relevant\nAnd compelling for people so the the fact that millennials are receptive in the way we're discussing um and we understand how they'd been missing educated they're misguided in interpreting certain things for example\nUm ... have been taught\nThat the great recession in a two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market and even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that\nWas started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was to have government bail out the different firms\nThat had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government Moran centered or the government so\nWe don't have\nAll realize that these kinds of um ... examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political authority is even more justified\nIt makes a huge difference in their receptive to the to the idea of liberty\nWill come back with more with my guest David Thoreau again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute that we're looking at a way\nThat new ideas and thoughts can actually be transmitted to a generation that has rejected a lot of pressure traditional ways that we do that\nBorder cub money six six five oh jumbo

country\nA I had never heard of these programs I guess it's a sign that maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now a or is it just a sign
