me\nDo you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get into some of the details behind it why we seem to be out of control at this time\nUh I think that's probably many reasons but the point of the book was really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology\nAnd I I think the psychological physicians are probably best trade with respect to the\nConcept of religious conflict because I think that many aspects of what's taking place now that really ... uh what goes on between a sectarian groups are adding religious level\n[noise] uh okay I Am a a a a religious\nLevel All right uh ... please amplify further on that are obviously we're not talking about\nUh two different religious sects per se and unless you want to uh uh consider a I

the other for how they get a ... or ...\nWell you've covered in a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure that's directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before it deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuine relief free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organized to try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society Malcolm faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nWith the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is a possibility by defer to the doctor right and\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation to leave for a\nUnified groups to ultimately break down into smaller divisions so I I think there is no way of avoiding ... what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is uh the extremes polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to this is ...\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the riding a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... on ... on your show who

spending on going on and then from\nCan't I don't care if the law is position\nLet's let's have a resume debate I mean if we can talk without screaming at each you know ... ... which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm there I called the Clinton machine the machine has his just can use to give up the fact\nThat two years ago two years in the ...\nYou know you lost the election okay I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest ... when you're going to try to build it out not tear down\nWell again I Know the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons a specially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and the fact that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course if those tactics\nOf the silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect or most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so pure and you are so ... was that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book and you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you're several important points or whatever the points to try to make in the book has to do again with the on the line psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's said for some time now there is an increasing degree\nOf of the offices within the society and then the judge to increasing degree of moral perfectionism and obsession will drinking in society\nAs a result when when one morning and counted as those types of psychological structuring individuals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to\nUh take aspects of the ... that denied a self makeup and to place them on people around them or so and you have a group like a anti file\nA claim that the anti fascist and you look at the behavior it's very very obvious that the behaviors that behavior one would expect\nFrom the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA and an denying but you know claiming that it's the right to just doing it so that I take the motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I I agree with you entirely I think one of the creators problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are\nCurrently on the books for a place like a Portland for for the mayor of Portland to sit by\nAnd have people riding on the streets and I mean she used to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah again it it is not something that uh that that can can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a police shooting that brought a writing to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say that if people feel aggrieved enough the thinking a free pass on behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nNow who's you know go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it's the role of the Gulf than a political local level and the federal law ultra postal as a country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outbursts or from these groups because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly are we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people responded positively when are they are told that their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come\nAs a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\nFrom a cedar valley through the court\nIs the voice of eastern Iowa New

whatever reason yes I like everybody else would tend to agree with my viewpoint so it's almost a a a ... uh uh it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that hey I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with we must be wrong\nOr nor beat that no matter how right I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is a level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I just uh it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we have done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising children or children had been raised with this concept to preserving your self esteem uh with the concept of

that's really able to look at itself critically a as a result they they have to preserve this concept\nOf perfection and anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs we
