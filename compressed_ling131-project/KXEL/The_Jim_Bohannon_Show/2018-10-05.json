of\nWhat's your name a\nDoctor and report\nRight right Dr Ford you know\nFor her to be saying that the anxiety and post traumatic stress and all that the first thing she asked for which she sat down was a big cup of coffee I mean\nAnd then she strength sixteen ounce bottle with coke I mean for somebody is so nervous and stuff like that in front of a committee like that on Capitol Hill she was taken that caffeine pretty pretty well it just struck me\nAnd then the laughter was the one thing that she remembers a traumatized here in Los Angeles sweating and all that at the interview on NBC she said the same thing\nDo after the laughing at stuff and that just you know I the credibility is just ridiculous I think you have to have this role in my opinion because if it if it drags on any longer I think he's going to get it\nAnd or if he doesn't it'll end this stuff but I really do believe he's going to get it\nIt it does appear so I I think that that is that I as I say it's safer ... way

imagine\nFine I accept that our sympathies go to you and I will assume that that you would fact were sexually assaulted you have the benefit of the doubt but when you go making charges against somebody else you've got to come across with the appropriate information they do expect us to take you seriously\nThan this I don't remember where and when when and all who was there but that doesn't cut it\nWe may still have sympathy for you but we cannot take seriously charges against another human being based on basically nothing no information but so ever uh Archie and the cameras image than

State Kerry by heavily by by President Trump uh that's that's interesting that you couldn't even or even get a any takers on that I find that remarkable\nUsually usually somebody will take it at least as a joke but you're not from those out here about two weeks ago mhm and that was important you know of course and Republican candidate so uh it looks like he's right on the agenda if he was alive and say he's gone\nWell it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of these senators from uh from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I am in Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nHas filled in a way almost liberated but because she's trailing so badly\nElection outcome as I say I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota has a built in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly that I think that all she wants is a cabinet position in a democratic administration I I don't know I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue
