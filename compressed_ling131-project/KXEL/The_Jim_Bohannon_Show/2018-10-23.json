this morning rejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nMichael let's start with you\nHow many of your problem is that the United states has even immigration laws\nI think even immigration laws are are are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated or\nMonth this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants are so what should the United states do it so seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand which the United states feel about the ... country on the planet I think we can handle\nOn a a caravan of people and arm come into this country so let 'em and [laughter] well I I'm saying to process improperly real quick on the immigration there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet [laughter] issue get turned into a complete political football there's very little army discussion about what's actually happening and kept turning a talking point that there\nIs something I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly infant is treated such as it that way so I think the ... I mean these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution um do\nOffers um in in the only\nOnes who are but the backdrop his win terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens\nFor a discussion alright that's from Fox and friends are sworn in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim what's not all political\nStop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have offered says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week tail end of next week right before the midterms\nWell these days the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass but this sort of invasive behavior has gone on every day I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is a type of thing that goes on and I think\nThis place badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let 'em in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd as a military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but sure did that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong we do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process\nThis it is not just political\nAnd all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sound on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to us the ban and that was really good stuff that you're the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim boat that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me ... this caravan story if it breaks right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking America's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't feel good as Americans of Trump\nStops is I think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it\nHe loses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you just stop stuff like this and we don't want to love to hear from you my name is Tom junior data [noise] I'm sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One\n[noise]\nFrom a cedar valley proven court or\nThis is the voice of eastern Iowa news talk to the point to the Waterloo Cedar Falls into rapid\nVila here with my home improvement tip of the day whether you're replacing an old appliance\nWithout anyone losing their life or anything like that\nBut this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until we put up enough of a barrier ha a wall\nTo stop this but this is why Trump was elected Democrats in the media or not they think this is the October surprise that this is going to cut in their favor\nI don't see it in that way at all or let's go to Dan in ...

we normally think about\nYeah um it's been manageable or at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with agents are where we uh we had controlled and better but now with these horns coming as it's getting back out of control\nSo used to have a good yeah\nWell here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know um [noise] he called the President Clinton said in the military down there which is a smart move however listen these people are coming and it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp uh we had the greatest military on if we can set it up and no time set up with cans and with holes in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need and therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you can either do it by the ... air stationery over in Sierra Vista at the Fort would chew guts and here's the thing is ... and we used to do this a long time ago ... what you do is is\nSo these people are really claim some refugee status or some asylum status and stuff and and what they do is they may um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they what they should do is set up these um um um\nThere's one I think you can and then have them go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there\nAnd send down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain and then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway without releasing them into the United states\nAnd if they go through this then we could do what's called the jeep pet flight which is a repatriation flight to their country\nAnd hold on I'm In agreement but that here's the problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the\nCountry and that's it because they're swell by the numbers\nOrganizing this and it's going to be bigger I don't know how you're going to hurt them towards these refugee camps to be heard I don't think they're going to settle for that\nWell I'll be honest with you I mean a lot ... who's in charge and they are are we are\nWell look so your ideas humanitarian aid couldn't\nFailure and I tell you right slump we're talking to those countries in saying that we're going to look cut off your ah money that's right well that's good but they're forgetting one big country and this and that would be in Mexico and writes the cut them off do if they can't control it and they've got the military that they can control and then we can control\nBut well put thank you that's a new humanitarian idea the the fly in the white man it

she's been out it Ellen DeGeneres was number for not\nMay shock you think of Alan nice enough woman it seems to me the dancing and all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race\nJust gives them an incredible forum everybody's so nice there is no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about\nWell the executive producer do you know the executive producer is that the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand and I think this is what they did generous show was about\nHe attacked millennia Trump I mean look you can attack president ... how do you ...\nThe executive producer Andy lesson or took to Twitter\nTo insult Mrs Trump and to praise the caravan he said\nI'm way more afraid of another millennia getting into this country than I Am of any of the caravan of human beings seeking asylum is what he

course we cut and we've seen this we've lived through various things are these millennials and the light to them done that they just see that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for some millennials student loan debt Everytime I see this Cory Booker is out there tonight you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey\nCory Booker is calling for fifty thousand dollars be given\nTo children in various families of under income that's his big ploy running for president\nJust give them fifty thousand dollars that's a way to make things more equitable fifty grand by that a hundred grand I don't know the fifties enough\nAnd I've seen Democrat after Democrat\nGone after student loan debt well here's the same who's charging wild as the people that run colleges are progressive Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging well every time they raise the rates people start to scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government is set up then what do they do they raise the cost who's responsible\nFor how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up bigger they're charging whatever they can get away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive set a running it All right so who is the most polarizing figures celebrity

on\nYou know they vaguely might be a Democrat or Republican but they're sick of the politics they see this is a different time in a different person what do they see on the other side they see people doing stuff every day that are mob like these are mobs\nI've had it here in Philadelphia I've experienced some of it we have a lot of anti ... here but it's not just ... its people going crazy all over the place believing that is the first amendment right to harass people scream at them as a professor this week\nAnd the University of Mississippi did nothing about it he tweeted out don't just harass these a conservative seats Republicans when you see them out there if they're in a restaurant\nStick your fingers all the way through their salad and all mess it up if they've ordered appetizers take them and distribute them to everyone do what some of them bring boxes with you to steal their food and take it home type of stuff that's being condone that freedom of speech that's

Americans are going to side with even though like Dave or quite quite said if he doesn't like Donald Trump the wave present at times and all that\nThat protecting America even if law versus the other side just on the attack significant numbers are going to go with the Trump agenda side that's the way it's going to work\nAnd this caravan is exactly that coming up soon to take a moment to put something on your radar screen\nAnd I bet a lot of people listening have not heard this but when you do maybe you'll tell people about it and it'll START I I Know the media has got a lot to cover now

government wait until you hear what happened with it or didn't happen the wall Street Journal just did a big piece on our but that's the only national media the rest of the national media said we're not going to cover her could it be because Murphy is a far progressive\nAnd that's why they won't cover so we're not seeing national media it's worthy of it I Want to choose it by hand and listeners

the rally tonight or in that area you\nGot to give us a little bit of your play by play on at the big Trump rally now Katie Brennan is a woman who were deeply for governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who is very very liberal\nRunning for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez who got a hundred and forty thousand dollar job as a housing czar in the Murphy administration after he won drove her home\nOr you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked you use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend a joiner she shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Eddie Murphy's tower they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a forum they did an investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now the legislature apparently it's going to have a special team investigate this and a a former a judge is being brought in to investigate it\nBut why should national media not interested in is even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat and Jay dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think this would be all the rage given what we went through with cabinet here's a woman with resources does it by the book\nNow Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if the woman says all that though it's true you have to believer Cory Booker in Jersey and these others right well\nThis woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets criminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job\nAnd despite all these complaints there still gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's what the wall Street Journal seems to say the point being that double standard rears its head her name is Katie brand name\nIn any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece\nAbout it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so the standard coming out of cabin up people on the left in the media you shouldn't be on the court\nIf a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow does this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there in gyms audience\nAbout this nobody no follow up\nNow even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf ear well\nThat's an object lesson I could live with that if that's where they come up with a coming through the meat to ear and all that or could it be", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "23"}
