tonight in most in the Wisconsin and of course it is there is a certain amount of irony obviously attached to the president calling for a a civil tone or it would have been a lot I think\nA better for him had he not engaged in some of the tone that he is send them to pass because that would have given a clear and moral superiority\nOr in contrast to a party which has stood by and a centrally in some cases are actually whipped up the mob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the mob but again the president is often hard pressed to uh\nTo curb his tongue so as a result he finds himself dipped into the mix with the with the others who are your thoughts on that a doctor you were as we go back to some calls here\nWell I think I think when we talk about President Trump or talking about actually a businessman who at a political position\nNot a politician he practiced and I think that's one of the reasons why he want to and he he was not a career politician and a lot of um middle America just upset and having to deal with\nWith both parties that seem to become kind of a ruling class and they were tired of that so they put somebody in there are different and\nI think they expect him to make mistakes in the coal pause and it doesn't bother to the middle class or the middle group of America\nSo I I think they feel he's justified in the state\nUh I'll put it this way he makes the enemies he doesn't need to make and that would be my friends at a complaint for a David in San Francisco hello David\nJim when your guest sure I've I've always had a fear of a a a fear

going instead cost old you are and and usually know accounting so top secret budgets fear based budgets a suit and sometimes a bad science budgets are can clearly go out to just off the register with if you're trying to check the books for Congress\nAnd you discover that some program is just looking at for all it's worth a you know when you get whistle blowers we the people to whistle blowers okay and and so this idea of getting every that getting married to start spending money on every willy nilly deal as opposed to this whole incident\nThe Saudis are so guilty\nLeast two versions of trying to be afraid of of people seeking freedom\nYou know I guess I'm trying to put your comics in the context of the discussion at hand we're talking about the er the seven pipe bombs that were delivered to various locations I mean\nI remember the tolerate it usually what\nThey do and I doubt that most of the people in the audience what are the Palmer Raids and how does that relate to what we're talking about\nWell that's how good your Hoover got his start and it was in Woodrow Wilson's day and they had these pipe bombs that went off in Vanderbilt\nActually went off in this case pipe bombs could have gone up I trust your not not assuming the tracking down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a I mean maybe budgetary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the Patriot act and they\nCame out I about where they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we faced an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's they founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose I don't feel that these particular instances we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights it if for quote unquote safety\nIs a bad mistake I think we have to be cautious as citizens and pay a lot of it at all what are governments doing out all of them and we're we're the watchdog so\nI I see where he's coming from we need we need to make these low down some of this knee jerk reaction\nAnd make it more of a thoughtful\nProcess nuance and there are times and you know I Know that we just have to react because we only have fine yeah\nAlthough of course I Would note that that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our rights for example we don't have a right to get on an airplane quickly correct but all I Do a dawn in Albany, Oregon now\nHit everything that I thought at least for me it's sounding like Sam wack job to President Trump's rhetoric for marching orders\nMaybe or maybe he decided that he would still be tried to smear conservatives we don't know\nThis is true yeah and and then it was to\nCoordinate it though I don't know how much a quote unquote white job could could a coordinated\nThe that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber that that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't come they don't tend to come in well organized groups exactly\nYeah the ... that that I think the the the doctor makes a very good point there that for this to have been delivered to the manner that it was would indicate that we are talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it they have given that we will always\nHave people of that nature we've got three hundred twenty five million of us but organized a that\nThat of course is a whole nother level of

to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story log after this bomb thing has gone away they can be the mid term elections that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading up to that point so maybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe it as part of something\nBut it's going to be uh that uh that we're going to forget about it and the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take to forget the Bob's\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes terrorize a culture or a specific population and what that often did was you know wage that people's fear of a cultural annihilation and and usually\nWell those individuals up and made them move in the action so if we take the idea that maybe this was a political a\nPlay that they're trying to get maybe more Democrats now to go to the polls that actually vote by say look they were all targeting Democrats we almost lost a whole generation of our leaders\nOr maybe I mean as I say yeah we're we're we we all just at this juncture we just don't know how to get

that I have I rarely go over all of the the various possibilities indeed covers a lot of territory [noise] uh but I guess what you could conclude most\nFrom what I've said doc is the fact that uh we

know you get several packages I say what particular thing may based people realize it was a suspicious package [noise]\nWell that's a good question I have not been made clear ah why these uh none of these packages went off or uh or that they were suspicious now\nHillary Clinton has a has a I gather given credit\nTo uh their Secret Service detail or would presumably they go through packages that the Clintons receive my guess is that the Obama Secret Service detailed does the same of why the others would have been suspicious I don't know\nThat that's a good question uh and and again I'm not clear to me whether they they were open but didn't explode or they just weren't open in some cases they joined opened apparently\nThat's what you know that's what I was wondering too that you know not open and not just you know just out\nThere what made these other people say you know high this package is suspicious they just didn't\nFeel right doesn't look right now what ... ... you know somebody's what what's out there that made them think that way but uh that's my comment and I'm just enjoy your show and keep up the good work\nWell you're very ... thank you very much and I I must say that you make a very intelligent comments there indeed uh what stood out about these packages a good question uh is certainly if you get a heavy packaging a pipe bomb has a heavy package\nA write off the bat you tend to think was that something I ordered\nA that could cause I don't tend to get really heavy stuff myself see even the somewhere in North Carolina Hello Steve\nGood morning Jim how

looked\nInteresting how do you first of all how do you know that the ... attacks were called part of the Clinton machine I have no indication personally that [noise]\nThat although I certainly have not condemn the the ... attacks I have no reason to believe that the the confrontations with the likes of Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell were organized by quote the Clinton machine I have no such knowledge and I'm just curious how you do\nThey they they simply move to go to England yeah um you know because\nI'm only ... who who will go to the end of the\nDay with the Clinton machine is basically um Mm it's built around a whole group of people who just real\nIt's the cleaning machine is basically um and it's built around a whole group of people who just ... let this go they hate our president so much and they think I hate him too and that's ...\nWell all I can say is that a while I certainly have seen a lack of condemnation of such activities I have yet to see any linkage between the antifa groups and be quote Clinton machine\nNor have I seen any linkage between this bombing attempt to release bomb and get tips and the the quote Clinton machine there there is the remnants of the Clinton machine out there but the linkage escapes me back in the moment\nFrom a cedar valley through the court is the voice of eastern Iowa New song fifty four you care the Waterloo Cedar Falls

about\nAbout the Trump records at a at frankly been falls like are\nThe economic recovery started on his watch but I Do recall a lot of the the confrontational type of of comments from Obama's so but the others yeah Clinton certainly very cold or certainly the George Soros has been behind a ton of this uh John Brennan agreed Maxine Waters big\nTime so you know some of them that is true\nAnd

not have cancellations understands\n... well the package that that was delivered to CNN was addressed to John Brennan first of all why would you send a package to CNN\nWhen it was supposed to go to John Brennan who's not hang around CNN secondly that package was delivered by a delivery service that's why the postage wasn't capital okay then why did you put postage on the first place but there are a lot of unanswered questions here\nYou know I understand that if you want to draw attention to the Clintons than you would put it through the mail\nI don't understand why why if you wanted to draw attention to the Clinton Jew would put it through the mail I miss that\nWell because of the secret service\nThe secret service checks everything that sent the Clintons crushed me and and just say I think the Obama detail\nI understand that but that was saying is if you want to draw to whoever it is a who's a Democrat is doing it they want to draw attention to it\nI I guess I'm missing why using a delivery service as opposed to the Mayo would draw more attention if you said a prominent person a pipe bomb you're going to draw attention\nYou know I understand that but I did a poll on and saying is if you want to draw attention to themselves they would put it through the mail there so the secret service would find it\nWell the secret service believe me any package that goes to the Clintons goes to the secret service trust me same thing with the Obamas any former president and they do not open their own male trust me on that skip\nA ... it it is always vetted by somebody else a
