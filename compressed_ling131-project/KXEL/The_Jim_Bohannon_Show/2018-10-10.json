and\nI don't know I I don't know how accurate the information is but I've heard this on a several major a conservative talk radio programs that a Rod Rosenstein ah was going around trying to get Trump or removed under the twenty Fifth Amendment\nBuddy can only get a couple of cabinet members to agree with you know it it just seemed coincidental that Trump met with Rod Rosenstein what just two days

O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the out of the calls from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome ...\n... there to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live our\nAll here he was spending that much experience as Ben I'm sixty one years old I've I've tried ... travel and most of the major ways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith ... with on an on the major freeway but then if you go to a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going to do go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you should start on the sidewalk votes because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on declare major uh I'm In a state and then and then and then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well ... is the one that the kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me as though they\nSlowly correct but in poorly you know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to watch those rows you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track so some of these escape areas that you may find yours\nIn Philadelphia with and so when you're traveling on a leisure early um track so some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area and that everyone knows you're going to be there and I and other people are going to meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major rose to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nSo when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem\nYou don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and we're told at a beat so it has to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach are we going to do to through in this direction\nTo that location so this way family members who rely on\nThose even the people on the other side cannot get that signal meaning the text of the email that says wants that sour turns on and the people on the other side\nYou get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call them ... thoughts here or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nOh and makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you can set and activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in the times of\nWeather related problems such as Michael you know the storms getting thrown down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers set of people that you're sending a signal to went down ...\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instilling receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you go in that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive it wants a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive the message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio and the good old ubiquitous over the radio always there just to review in such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the show with our guest disaster preparedness expert Anthony kovac good evening Patrick\nA good evening and get them all of this uh this coverage is a very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script for a movie [noise]\nUm why not just bomb a [noise] um [noise] hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive [laughter]\nA wave of [noise] but uh [noise]\nMaybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb too because you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes by\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh him practicalities are such an idea there's just too big and really\nWell you know well let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states less to say all of this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for die burning this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and it goes straight through Mexico City and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nHow we liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hits they've got to kind of be upset\nYeah and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody will never found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the Iowa hurricane this was I think the game was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left during an added inland\nAnd the bottom like anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I I don't believe the ever again that was tried so a lot of the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly of\nA one of just simply change of course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and are you [laughter]\nIt can be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an Anthony ... and\nHis book is emergency

you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that it's a you know twenty on the Richter scale of every structure and road is flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely it'll go kid is always an easy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances or your your advice for a gym would please Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean and built kid is just that so let's say you are you have to abandon your vehicle and you have your whole Trump's holding go cats\nBut you have your backpacking you carry ... of the most essential stuff a few days the food and medicine
