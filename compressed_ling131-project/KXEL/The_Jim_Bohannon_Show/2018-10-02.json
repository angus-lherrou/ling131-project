S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we both countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job and say well you can go make we\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens is the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but\nThey say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make their products for that's what the rub is with with Canada\nA to a call from Sharon in ...

in the spring\n[noise] one to get the facts white\nAnd we as a lot of different ... and movies and documentaries the kind of miss and particularly ... mountains but one of the most important things in the stories you know all the military leaders with us troops are simpler my George Herbert Walker Bush just because people were starving to death and President Bush said to me a million in tax next month\nSo we had to send troops over there we went there for humanitarian reasons and then it turned into a credible fight\nBut all senior military leaders in the show that the man said we need some armored vehicles over their case our troops get in trouble she landed on pace and Bradley fighting vehicle to protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a rebel hat\nSecretary defiance laugh at him and said no we're not going to send them so when General David\nCarnell time and and and and colonel Ellen but he was a major science when they had to go out there and rescue those rangers after

off from the main element we had to recover them um [noise] and uh\n[noise] I guess the the thing that probably took the longest was extraction of the bodies out of the super six one helicopter um [noise] uh the attitude that helicopter landed was uh was actually it was a\nUm that he flipped over and so it was very difficult to get those bodies out so um [noise] uh and intense fighting the entire time uh getting to the crash site so while we were on the crash site and then extraction off the crash site so [noise]\nUm if you've seen the movie a Black Hawk down those Randy mentioned earlier the the movie does a very very good job of portraying the intensity the battle and uh that was um\nThere's a long night [noise]\nVery much so tell us about the battle from your perspective as

where everybody goes home and uh\nAnd ... and at at that point um and there was some level of recognition when Colombia we got on the net and said\nYou know we're going to stay here as long as it takes to get everybody out of here and I and I think that that statement ah at that time was created a calling effects throughout the entire organization which was essential in in allowing us are
