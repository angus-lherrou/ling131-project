six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with\nBill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing me ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the best seller list and there were going to look a bit of just do what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what usually is the case was you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the in the world war two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until a killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover be as bad and uh was an occupier in southern Germany uh before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat in and many other\nA powerful people in the U.S government was we got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you remember from killing hadn't had one actually fight them you want to defy Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the judge did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people ... people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most of our human beings have it off the planet called Odessa\nAnd him are new about a year\nA before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and him with the way he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff from him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization\nBut he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff from him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they help\nThese guys are get out of Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened and also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them\nA elements of the Vatican help them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy an on boats to Spain South America and South Africa\nOr if it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took a big guys and we took it I meant andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Marty woman\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work though it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... says people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nWorld War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nJust ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people to all that couldn't happen yeah\nIt did it and it can happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that\nI certainly understand that the motivation [noise] but I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican another's did him in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did ill and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after it off Eichmann\n... they had to say if you don't Mr President and we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who does that mean that forced force Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it who blackmailed and\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that if Truman didn't sign me whatever the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with that he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in a concentration camps\nAnd an insult true and then that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people\nKnew it but he couldn't salad oh wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will or some orders for thought from his latest for the killing series\nKilling the ss and it is a a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo

Democrats are counting on this anti Trump wave but at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff so I'm a you know again it's impossible to predict there is anger\nBut there's also a you know let me give you an example Jim and is it pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed a writer for the call their program put out a tweet that said okay\nWell maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way that it was on his ... he said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff and certainly no one of my staff at Bill O'Reilly dot com who'd ever\nPut out a tweed like that and keep their job and I couldn't because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because Kevin as children\nAnd he has a wife and a mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who still working at Kobe or to no action against gay is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans are picking that up\nThey're picking up that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous\nAnd then there's nothing in the world more tragically ironic that people are calling themselves and anti fascist\nWho's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean they called themselves anti fascist is just tragic ironic and and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them\nThe the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A.\nIn Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody that oppose Nazi isn't it's the same tactics are at the same same thing but in America a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nAre you a lot of them do\nYeah yeah so I'll tell you a quick break come back with more from a Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

now they are looking ahead to making this available to all of their fans all across the country you two are real life sisters with North Carolina's\nWe'll real life or at home there from the same cloth so they color Irish Twins\nAnd I know you you when was the first time you do realize that may be more than just your friends and neighbors might be interested in hearing you\nAgain on this that we never knew all of that want to make a left me a planned plants or any of his here we only get people on our you every time the right to know people were going to hear from the point of whether\nWe had no plans for any of this here we only had two people on our youth who traveled right just didn't know people were going to hear if we were going to resonate we were just they were trying to be honest candid\nAnd open the window up here too because sometime here to let you cuts right on to get some things off of our chest because we did not like the way they were doing in Donald Trump him under the bus and back on that bus on him\nNo reason at all he had been in the public I thought all these years and that one time but they call them those nasty nasty and they got to run against Hillary Clinton\nWell there's certainly there was a shall we say a major turn around and it and when they want when he won\nThen obviously that has something to the majors sector this country has not come to terms with cannot accept that he was making them out except that he signs bills into law they accepted the dictates national policy in accordance with the\nThe constitution this was a major problem from them and it's been about two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in ... yeah he really did when\nWillie Willie with all of his accomplishment look at what he's attained within two years have done more in a while to get the one eight years but they don't like that I got this than President Trump is not\nA career politician either businessman I always say if you want to know what's going on with the body look ahead at the hands of prosecutors and successful the body of people are going to be successful and look at the day what's happening\nBut there's no question about the fact that he's a Serbian or a major impact into I'm Wondering how you you got to be connected with his campaign I mean obviously there are a lot of people out there who\nWho are rally to his his support but not many people have gotten to actually speak at a at a rally he's held for a candidate Trump but and then President Trump how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nI Do like oh I Can't tell somebody from is kept it out for\n'em and it just fell off from there he came in North Carolina there was no way they were going to be here in North Carolina we not be there\nSo it was a race for us to be one of his rallies he invited us on his stage name that says we didn't have to take his Mike He gave it to us to let us say whatever we wanted to say if we're not all of those cameras back there to back was it was probably over a lot of them\nAnd I'm Out there that that was that was just it just fell apart after that I think that next January and Mississippi open up for a rally and we've opened up so many of them yeah I'm I just can't column\nAnd that's I mean they didn't plan it we didn't wait till we didn't have to talk to anybody it's always been like that it's just everything just don't bother to all this has\nReally think about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time he is about the people he or the people real people um he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct\nDonald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president I mean he ... he look at who he hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire\nHe even though he has a billionaire act any I don't think that I hear what the people and all the people he was because he wrote us go ahead\nSay Oh yes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to the people nobody saw him he's not beholden to\nHollywood or the lobby is nobody bought him a paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in office\nTo analyze it all and look at the left wing media how they spend the laziest gossip stories and this and they always mayor who they they fear him because they know he's win and they don't try to stop loses but they will try and stop all winter\nAnd now they they certainly are they are taken a menu of course now do you are women you are African American and oh that really sets off the the far left crowd because you people have minds of your own and you're not doing what you're told to do and then\nThey didn't anticipate that they will\nCome along a dime an issue that people will start taking out like dominant feel you know\nThey wanted us to hear container or what they're saying that three as thinking on the inside of the box [laughter] they're not saying that they can't remember now what Obama did back in a day Obama papal\nStaff that Obama can create an atmosphere for economic opportunity for people people with Hollywood wanted him to stop it\nAnd the masses have looked at how the leaders are so upset with down but the Trump upset with

Skelton as well as doing a lot of his television specials and a\nJackie Gleason dean Martin the Jerry Lewis and we were in that realm we were kids doing rock and roll or being bad boy so I I like the fact that we had a clean cut career and we're still very healthy it's still around to this day\nWell it certainly is it didn't just burned across the sky like a shooting star the Letterman have had to

hard and they try to get pity for themselves I think they're trying to get pity for all the millions of dollars and making\nThat [laughter] I always say if I'm On the road and getting up some occasionally you have to say in after you wanted to end its foreign catch that's like you know what I think at the alternative Jim his shirt beach digging ditches\nDoesn't do it it really does now you have you guys was such a beautiful pure sound and yet you interact with an audience so well so I'm curious about this you've got the touring the live shows and you've got the recording studio and of course\nUh with the live show or you have that immediate spontaneous reaction but it's it's one take mistakes but all whereas in the recording studio wild granted\nA nobody's cheering but maybe they and our guy behind the window but but you can do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect and so I'm curious which did the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road lives spontaneity\nWell you know probably the worst interview were in the world is if you eat in the world is on the very positive guy I don't look to the negative and they don't come so question like that night I answer is I prefer to vote because it does\nIf you're in the studio for a month or so and then you're on the road from it keeps you that friday of seeing the country seeing the world that yet
