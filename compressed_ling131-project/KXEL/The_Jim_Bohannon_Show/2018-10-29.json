bit interesting if anybody else out throughout the collection the early ... what part of the early voting place is packed diet it pretty nasty there\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are sort of you are you talking about an actual polling place is that right\nHere you know you got one side on one side and the other side and then the other side and you know one site training at the office\nI are talking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning with so many feet of a polling side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet that but what was happening and it wasn't as it was it's not only screaming at the other people that they or I can\nBut it was it with a different party at the parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases the party for at one another so even when they heard the falling on\nThe kids get paid anything interesting is fought happening in other places that they cite Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was weird\nYeah well again ah I ah ah\nYou you would you have in in in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the or\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like\nFire houses in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to the protest outside of a of a mailbox if you sit in an absentee ballot or or or a protest in the offices of let's say a a county a\nOf a cow the office building so these are actual polling places huh that well\nYes all of that law like what they call it is early ... are they going to focus his early ... and then after a certain state they have to go through their ... cream thing to do and then of course you can see the apple two thousand but he is I Would say that warning this story\nBroke get by with their not knowing that that they see the cat that I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that was like a fall out later that after that I even heard\nOf that a bad thing on the phone now\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the uh the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is and I'll stay\nClear Wyoming today a lot of people in this state like if they had had had this ongoing arrest record in healthy people that have been arrested for twenty eight and out on the street I guess that's the thing like they have\nA\nIf it reflects as me as well of

or or what would matter in terms of uh of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but to see what you're saying then yes obviously something needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur Oleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight for the good evening [laughter]\n[noise] yeah that was on your mind so I'm fine I'm a law\nAs I saw was I got all your saying where laws and you know a person can only got so many chances I was also looking at it from my mother proactive angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health\nIs even more under served in the medical field that are all and so maybe after somebody goes and stuff like times yeah they brought the offer of Asian people overall maybe they could have a thing\nWhere they ah what people are mental probation where they they specialize will help us out and they got to help and maybe\nThat was more acceptable at first place that first with maverick yet to the ways in our minds whether\nThey justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money the professionals arts so that's why part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was right by the FBI investigation\nThat the financial part of it and I'm from the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody I'm prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place that just rice less especially\nYeah especially somebody could be better buildings bombs and they\nAlways say get lucky they\nAlso got on the fact that\nI something actually happens and people get hurt that prevent something like that with a little bit of Spanish or a Sunday ICS priceless\nWell somebody that I Would agree you are certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health science down to ... to do such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect the brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources

know like it was you know not attack or nothing with that in ...\nAnd so I'm kind of interesting observation and so\nThere are pictures out there that the show um apparently at the at the Trump

or other brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you\nHave a basis they're under the law for some kind of a of a preventive activities or something else again but I'd

right process I don't understand and I am a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries\nI don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through that shall we deal with it and they don't have to\nThat's right but uh they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially a toilet to flush their uh unemployment and other problems on to the United states\nYes sir they are absolutely\nAnd I I I'm forty nine years old I'm a I'm a war veteran and I voted for the first time for a president this last election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he has planned on putting our military on the line to stop them is absolutely correct\nI don't see how there's an argument for that\n[noise] oh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who

deputy undersecretary of defense and currently columnist with the American spectator online and spectator dot org we're talking about the end of this intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which President Reagan had concluded that thirty one years ago with Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied on the mind of a gland who calls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenn the good evening\nTo you for like two\nOr three was president of Charleston draw from the tree and then also the general comments about John Bull by the national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties and all of the Persian to ... ...\nIn Germany they were saying that the European Union is going to allow it in these intermediate range weapons that we may or may not produce there'll be put on their soil they scream bloody murder about this with ...\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly knew what I you know where he is raising a very very good point I don't think the NATO countries are going to allow\nUh enter a medium range ground launched green missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat where\nThere are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate range weapons include an intermediate range of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type\nCruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good in this all the system but they're not perfect by any means they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack\nAnd that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think is to offset the Russians are doing here but a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as Star Wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing\nAbout the notion of a missile defense jet is in the middle east impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles and the speed of computers\nAnd the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second but it seems like it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this was not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get a better way we have systems right now our our strategic missile defense system station and California Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight\nWe have the bad a terminal high altitude air defense system we have batteries are and I think South Korea I Know we have other nations to I don't know they're in Britain or not you know we have a lot of other places uh you know these systems work\nThey're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is less money in and and invest in the science and engineering and yet you systems to a point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from Zach in western Nebraska good evening Zach\nGentleman

from war anytime you allow someone to aggregated treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't you\n... ... I mean even the Romans had his race for excused from below that you want he's for war and that's really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate a tree and get away with it and whether or not we\nAre the ... is a very different question and how we do a much better question so I don't know when Jacquie by bank are sponsored wars up you know that sounds a little wrinkly paranoid to me\nWhile I Do is not I think what we're talking about here tonight and in fact what we are talking about tonight is not any kind of a of intervention in third party affairs this is a treaty between the U.S and Russia or the successor state to the Soviet Union\nBut of intervention in third party affairs this was a treaty between the U.S and Russia or the successor stay to the
