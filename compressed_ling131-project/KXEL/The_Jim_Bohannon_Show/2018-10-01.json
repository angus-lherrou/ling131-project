probably about five years old really understand what was happening [noise] ah on nine eleven [noise]\nUh that means that anybody who was in college today except for adult students but the twenty two year olds and younger for those people nine eleven is as much history book stuff as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln\nNo you're exactly right and unfortunately they don't\nThey don't discuss nine eleven or as much as it around Lincoln are\nBy far but uh [noise] and then you're right on the numbers you know I have an Eighteen year old daughter that I actually just dropped off at Michigan State university two weeks ago and she was only six months old when when the attack occurred so [noise]\nUm this generation coming in the school now going into college even graduating college\nThan not old enough to remember so it should be taught and they should be uh they should learn a major substantial part of our history\nLooking back what lessons have we learned and what lessons should we have learned from the events of Seventeen years ago\nI think the the most important lesson we did learn is that um it's twofold run your intelligence capabilities have to be as\nAnd they let him in the end whether they start green card that's ...\n...\nIf it gets all uh immigration we let it in a million people here what are they really know who they are OK against that\nWell the ah I'm I'm sort of against the unrestricted immigration but I don't know that uh that uh this discussion really goes to the notion of\nOf whether any immigration is good I get my answer of some of it is vital uh and uh we certainly should not just shut off or anybody who comes to the country but I Do believe or a Bernard character that uh every sovereign nation\nShould have this as a rational immigration policy a policy of letting in people who are whose presence would be the best interest of this country\nYeah you know which end it's basic common sense it's exactly what you said in its basic common sense um why are there are members of Congress that are against that\nI have no I have a have a good assumption I strongly believe that the Democratic party is losing core anticipates losing\nA substantial amount of black voters and they're trying to do everything in their power to bring people in that they could show up in the communities and give them voting rights\nI think that's going to come down the line um but it's all about common sense and let people in the water coming here they believe in our our freedoms they believe and look as countries if they want to prosper and the country they want to be a benefit to the country those are the people who should lead in\nLet's talk about the your new book the grave above the grave that that's an intriguing titled what does that mean and don't you don't have to give away anything but\nIt's talk about your new book the grave above the grave that that's an intriguing titled what does that mean and don't you don't have to give away anything but just a what's the basis for that title\n[noise] well the ... in in my eyes look I Lived throwing a letter and I didn't talk in another number of\nCounterterrorism measures here in in Iraq for the U.S government but I also lived and worked in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for years and I work for the king of Jordan for five so\nThe enemy that we faced on another level I understand the idea of their history um why they want what they want and do what they do and uh primarily\nUh you know in their eyes if we don't worship their God or the way they uh they believe they ever right to kill us and they would have liked to annihilate the you know that element of our population so uh that and that's what the grade above the grape is\nInteresting of course not every Muslim obviously feels that way or there will be a terror attack of ... now\nA listen listen I you know I have a lot of Muslim friends including the king of Jordan who's at the Muslim a good man [noise] um but he is

the things that are ... you would read the book about the ... D\nYou know I had fifty five thousand people that work for me forty one thousand that those were uniformed officers besides you know the terrorism and besides the major crises there's thousand things going on and the PCs office on a daily basis and I try to demonstrate that in the book so a lot of that\nCame out of them and only reflection of my time in that office\n[noise] in terms of uh of the basic outline of the plot or what are we talking about again with without giving away anything but just set us up if you were from the grave above the grave\nWhere you have a you have the present day New York city police commissioner glee it's called to a shooting in what ... one of his cops are dead one severely injured and they'd say ... it's a it's a terrorist\nInvestigation comes out of that but this is a guy that has had to live after September eleventh he was a captain in charge of the precincts where the towers were and his wife was killed them not eleven so he has this set of people that that and now he's wound up in this\nInvestigation where it started all over again and it takes them all over the country and the end of the globe and that makes for a quite a compelling story\nWhile he's six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Steve goes from Columbus ohio for our guests Bernard Carrick author of the grave above the grave good evening Steve\nAn evening I'm Lester a Bernard a I got a question that law that Saudi airplanes were allowed to fly\nDuring nine eleven and a lot of acts in the U.S why we're not the nationals allowed but only the Saudis were allowed\nI wasn't aware that there were exceptions made for the uh the banning of a of a air flights in this country that drew\nA ... there were not flights that were banned from leaving a when the airports were opened a wants the airports were open or you know that anybody could leave but I think what he's talking about is\nA specific flight that was allowed believe I Believe out of Boston I'm In it had a number of members of the royal family from Saudi Arabia on it [noise] uh and I don't recall now Seventeen years later I don't remember exactly what day that was but it was pretty close to\nThat it was three or four days right after the attack on the towers um and that the authorization for that slight leads um was given by Washington\nNow right now to uh the notion of of what we need to be doing now if you were in a position or maybe I don't know a secretary of homeland security or what have you in a position to to have some considerable safe so uh what would you be changing about our approach to suggest\nAnd foremost the is the border and border controls border security um we have to have it secondly\nLet ice enforce the laws that are on the books you know you have all these people complaining about ice ... all they're doing is enforcing federal law and the one thing I Would do\nUm and and it has not been done but these mayors in these governors in these political leaders that interfere with the federal government's or enforcing the federal law the immigrant or the customs law I Would I Would lock them up uh I I Would not tolerate them\nInterfering in stopping members of the federal agents basically from doing their job uh I I it's wrong it's a crime it's against the law and if it was anybody else that was interfering hampering obstructing we'd lock them up\nOn a interfering with federal agents or simply failing to cooperate and I I\nCertainly don't agree with the actuaries city\nIt's there is both a crime if you fail if the federal government it's ice wants to know where somebody is and they get released in and I'm not a serious pedigree questions that you would\nGive to a local law enforcement agency you are required by law by federal law to provide that information and these people are doing it in fact they turn around and they just see the NATO ally and and the and all this other stuff it's a crime and they should be held accountable\nIt ought to be in the very least if they're not held accountable that way the should be denied a a federal money highway money education money or what have you absolutely agree yeah I Do um uh the routine we go through in airports if you could change that would you\nUm it was the one thing I Would do is you know you probably have Seventy Seventy percent sixty Seventy percent of your airline travelers in the United states\nThey are business travelers they're travelers that are in and out of airports\nMaybe two or three times a week ... that's their job it's it's a part of their job I don't think we have to screen these people the way they do every single time uh you know things that are as from other countries perhaps but I I just don't I think we we overdo it\nYou know sometimes we we over punish\nTeams that are as from other countries perhaps but I I just don't I think we we overdo it you know sometimes we we over punish 'em when we shouldn't be taught at the

certainly there were a bad feelings are developing as the civil war approach to the uh\nThat spill over into clearly some of this behavior but it wasn't just the uh the the the civil war that helped but there was just a general national attitudes of his first and think about it later\nJoined Friedman are just the\nProfessor of history and American studies at Yale University who's written the book the field of blood we talked about the famous painting of Charles ... about the the free to do all the only one of its type that you found were there were other incidents of do the the UAW uncovered putting together the field with blood\nThere were I mean for one thing but the most obvious thing I Know it was just the amount of violence because um I don't\nKnow one who's really written about this before no one's discovered it before until I was just stunned as anyone else when I started uncovering all these incidents but yeah there are a number of incidents in the book that are kind of shocking um there's one that takes place in the Eighteen forties\nFor example that I think is probably the greatest display of firepower on the floor of the house\nAnd in that particular case a there is a congressman from Ohio named Joshua getting she's giving an anti slavery speech and he's an aggressive anti slavery advocate and as he's seeking a fellow from Louisiana named John Dawson stands up and kind of positions himself in front of getting\nAnd pulled his gun and Cox it\nAnd I've seen him too that a couple of other southerners come over and stand by his side and they're all armed as well and it seems that there are number of\nWeeks or anti slavery advocates who come and stand by the side of getting because they don't want him to be standing there alone and so at least for a few minutes in the middle of this speech you have six seven guy standing there many of them are armed and it's sort of showdown now in the end\nThis case nothing happens and the first fellow Dawson thought better of it he sits down and everybody else it down but just the idea that that happened and that it has been invisible for so long is is pretty shocking um but then later and Eighteen fifty eight years I'm a big fight that even people at the time I saw as being\nReally noteworthy and kind of shocking and in this case it when you had night sessions overnight session so or late night sessions or in Congress\nInevitably something bad would happen because congressman retired and they were grilled cheese they probably were drinking over dinner and so the atmosphere was bad and in this case is Eighteen fifty eight so we're getting up really close to the civil war and there's a lot of really powerful north versus south sentiment and\nThere's a fellow named the wonderful nineteenth century and inclusion grove from Pennsylvania who objects to something while standing amidst a bunch of southern Democrats and a fellow from South Carolina a name Lawrence catch a\nConfront him threatens them tells them you want to object to something go stand among your friends don't stand when my friends\nAt and ultimately a grows just slugs kit and knocked him slash and as soon as that happens this horror to southerners rushes to that spot so it's been a stencil blender break it up but most of them to join in and and see that\nFriends of grow northern Republicans comes streaming across the whole the whole pack of them jumping over desks and chairs to get\nTo their friend and ally as quickly as they can and you end up with this vast rumble in the space before the speaker's chair in the house of representatives with these guys punching each other throwing the tunes and you know any real mass rumble which\nDefinitely there's a comic element to it but at the same people who are watching it said wow you know that wasn't like\nOne congressman getting Iran and other congressmen and pledging in North against south that that was a group of armed northerners fighting a group of armed southerners in a pack that look like a battle and innocent it was\nWow gunfighter ... avenue corral are really really pretty remarkable stuff was there a\nMoment that could've been considered sort of a a a crossing the ruble God if you will of the ... the bishop priests age if you will love all of them they became a firing on Fort Sumter was already\nA ball or in Congress where of people in retrospect it back and say well that's what we really should have realized\nI actually\nDon't think so and I think that that's something valuable to think about I don't think there was the one crossing the line moment and I think nowadays barely talk about that sort of idea all the time do it wasn't\nI think it was a slow progression over time with things gradually getting worse and told by the second half of the Eighteen sixties things were really violent and it was clear that it was a lot of\nEnormous hostility between north and south but there was no solution and and this was part of the challenge of writing the book the people who are in the country at that time and in Congress at that time they're not assuming there's a civil war time they mirror assuming that whatever they're doing they're not\nGoing to be causing trouble that in one way or another there'll be able to stave off trouble for no I don't think there was a sort of clear why the only the only moment when there was a very clear that people say oh wow something just happened is when the ... southern states began to secede from the union and southern congressmen stand up and\nTo see their states from the Indian by leaving Congress and literally people in the galleries and people on the floor of the house and Senate are watching the unions\nAs the southern congressmen stand up and leave and there is a moment when when one congressman stands up and says to the room the union is dissolved that's a clear line in the sand", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018",
