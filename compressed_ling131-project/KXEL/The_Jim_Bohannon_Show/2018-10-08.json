to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about ... and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where Kavanaugh facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the locals are scared of that there might be an honest look and a revisit a narrow the weight which was ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution what most people don't understand either grow the weight were\nReversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nAs to deal with it true the issue of cursing heard\nBecause we wouldn't accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of air a life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because there shouldn't be about protecting

available shortly on line both Amazon and I\nDo still get to have a Facebook page\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting I'm a year to ... when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is Robert ... who's this or a PHD used don't always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got a Washington Post ran a story on\nThis and the next day he was blocked from Google\nThey actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson a we highlight and the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his content\nSo it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide at their whim\nOr how they are going to control what you see what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites\nI mean that they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think the example you just gave our our particularly nowhere to sort of thing I I understand it happens all the time and and and what the oil being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did\nThat is particularly interesting when we go to this in the in the film a is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way um but\nThey basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches on both Google and bang\nAs it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know\nThings seemed to be pretty balanced but Google and\nEvery single search position of the\nTop ten search results\nThis result favored\nHillary Clinton whether they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate that this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't shelter results at the end of the day [noise] um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is science essentially apolitical but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nHis real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that win undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at\nThe one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the

that are sort of bumping information to us was visible it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face and what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nAbout what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the test\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm ... now or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had to do this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah last us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois Lyndon\nHello am I Am a quick comment a lot of the

want to use Google result he wanted other resolved and I don't understand that Google ... did they make them the ... quake or what happened to it and I is that that go\nYeah I Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that it's an apple product\nAnd Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing the research is when it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because\nThey want the information and the data that comes through search results because they can monetize it and\nSell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right star page a is a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being present\nItem that is that is going to change your ... biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago\nDr go is good it's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges them best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo me there ... or manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there is even you know discussions about the fact that thing which is the Microsoft product which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google and a lot of people believe that there is some kind of ...\nWhere they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in the moment they pretend to be ready to play is everything alright ... electric

S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of wheat\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for a year and we both countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee and my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a a is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is\nWhat happens to the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but they say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products for that's what the Rob is with with Canada\nAll right to a call from Sharon in crane Missouri yeah good evening Sharon\n... and ... ...

University a professor of finance there and also a public policy analyst\nAnd we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal again it's not a done deal yet it has to get congressional approval but it I suppose it is not a stretch to assume that even a badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's talk to David who calls in from San Francisco tonight David good evening\n[laughter] yes I Am up in your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems directly tied to this Chinese steel\nAnd uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just have all the sort of five years ago and it was\nThis is the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact\nUh if you remember just the dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a\nQuarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge when the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs in six billion in finance so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken bridge\nAnd I was defective when it when it opened\nThere are ... are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was said okay well I didn't know then yeah and what was significant about it Arnold was the governor and this crush on Sunday or right okay yeah ...\nWas the Republican governor and Willie Brown was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart\nThere were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom and the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nOr you know each part had to have an inspector massive art ... almost to the to the mayor and they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nThat does sound like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact I I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut uh uh current in Rochester, Minnesota is a mixed up below courage\nHigh yellow the thing that bothers me about the uh the steel from China is if you drive a car\nA lot and you have to have your brakes three done he may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to you throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel may be cheaper\nBut the quality is also she\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about there'll be led to calls are regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor or something like visiting well I mean uh in the case of the break drums and that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe it will die\nOr is that the other problem\nIn trading with the Chinese the question of qualities that we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue on a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially are going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause a severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile in industry so if I'm In California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour\nAnd as a result of that they made a real nice shared that sold for fifty dollars well\nThey decided to outsource to make that China the shirts in China where people are at the time were paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nUh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can purchase much more uh goods and services because the prices are are lower", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "08"}
