is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\n[noise] why would a parent want to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright\nAnd you could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're

be here people who are parents get older they die the kids are supposed to carry on that's the whole point\nI wanted to produce kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone\nIt it just strikes me as on

wonder are these people thinking\nAt all I\nDon't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculates this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say [noise] life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain
