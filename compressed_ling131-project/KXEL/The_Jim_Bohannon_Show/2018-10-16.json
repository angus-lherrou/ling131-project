are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling your call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrat said at the starting with Cory Booker a used the phrase\nThe truth when talking about the testimony from Dr Ford buddies so telling the truth\nThere's no such thing as a truth the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is all you get this is a post modernist and this is the the big construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics to be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth\nAnd those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twentieth I'm totally for censure\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they're out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction\nBut what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong but there is there's right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the absurd that two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the liberals spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nIt depends I mean there's the theories as the theology and then there's the ... so the question is what a what is the practice or if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nUh I'm I'm the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country such as buying a show or elsewhere\nWhere it's ... the legal system we're sure real low actually becomes the ... of the land we're such as Afghanistan\nThan we have a problem because then the the truth is that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes these things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we'd have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but as a Muslim state but we have to be specific\nBecause we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but as a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talk to you about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left uh pushing harder and harder to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat uh you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go or do you think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah they're very good question I'm just a ... in the upcoming Mitt whose\nFault the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nA in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fight within the last hundred years\nMore than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party have managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAbdicated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases of who have an absolute axe to grind and very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor isn't presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such isn't fired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody is a good\nAs dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allowed the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the ... show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\n... hey hey you guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject of truth in that check a trip a\nStatus is Gary ... joined me this Saturday as the un I Panthers were back in the union don't win South Dakota state comes to town we'll start with the home of the Panthers dot com pregame show at new kicked off is that for\nExample is on the way he got an apple I get up and that thing is\nThe game stay tuned for the lie call in show\nYou when I first is South Dakota state this Saturday on your home with the Panthers news talk Fifteen forty ...\nTalk ... one or lose\nAnd interrogation that went wrong nine ...

away Obamacare is still on the ropes of the Republican Congress has passed session\nBut he's looking at solutions to health care problem that has not gone away Obamacare is still on the ropes of the Republican Congress as such and do nothing you'd seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's very real problem for many many people Lawrence goes from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nDid anything gentleman I I could use the time it more orientation here is genie see is that sort of like a political solution for candidates except you're selling ideas about health care\nAnd my first one was GDP a and this was as time has to have been some explain exactly what GDP advisors is\nLawrence thanks for the question always like doubting our company\nOr we are a consulting firm we traditionally help advocate on behalf of employers as well as patients and members of the healthcare system\nTo try to navigate what is often times very confusing system to do so so our clients normally are corporations that are trying to help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nOr I was there anything else that you are you wondering as Lawrence\nThat's good I think I can make my contribution now um\nI basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high\nA high also just bash allies in psychiatry now back in the days when I could charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the gym in an hour I actually made more money that way then over the years as it went higher and higher [noise]\nUh I Want to\nExpress my consternation and and and the lack\nOf understanding of what on earth happen there are those are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention except doing my therapy keeping up like\nA medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything went off the screen and maybe have some insights but [noise] um I Want to make a point here that\nUh once upon a time I think the medical world owes more\nUh like I was able to do it in the early days of my practice\nThat people were coming in the hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive way that was going to help them resolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still\nThey were in charge in that respect I think that's different then or your gentleman we're talking about a yet I'm\nQuite knowledgeable about the PBA ca and I understand the need to help corporations figure out how to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\nOkay well let's let's get to that on the second or so stay on the line but to your response to a ...\nWell there's a couple of things and when we're when a wry we started to see that go I'll go back in the first part of your question or comment orange which was you know back in the day it seems different than it does today and that she has back in the day it was different [noise]\nUm as as we continued to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I've now\nYou you know we can actually draw very clear and close parallels to what we saw in the banking system run to the other night we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail\nWe're seeing that same thing a ... in the healthcare system now healthcare systems are run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run my businessmen\nAnd and and the challenges that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation used to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system trying to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that\nThey're actually working together and working together because health as a result of the Affordable CARE Act insurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit per the AC a Fifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and the c._e._o.\nOf a Wall Street based organization I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin I Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patience to buy my product and this is part of the challenge we have an healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility\nIs to the shareholder not to the consumer and so we started to see this move when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred in fewer insurance companies are in the market\nAnd they've gone up the market share and now they're going to the hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe two and insurance companies now every doctors and network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care\nIsn't true at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do\nAll right uh say the least I've covered quite a bit to the thing that you would like to add to that Lawrence\nWell I can add and bring up the the second point a simultaneous I think um\nThere's something strange about a\nA doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrators are most hospital administrators have a bachelor's degree or they couldn't get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more interest martyr actually let these people run the entire\nBall of wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs down hospitals are even worse than a doctor prices ah the ... and and the\nOil we're going I'm going to bring your that doesn't move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause do it after these messages\nFrom cedar valley the corn on\nThe voice of eastern Iowa talk to the more you want to lose your balls cedar\nRapids graduating cadets more from the Iowa omen act in a

that what you're saying social Saturday\nYeah and get some tea and all of them that I call the guy said dad who aren't you have in our town\nAnd therefore they Rob Peter to pay Paul how\nAre you are you still be talking about the practice of taking money out of the Social Security trust fund which of course has been done for a wide variety of things and in fact a lot of people think that there is in fact an account someplace with all of that uh\nThat cycle withholding when in fact there's nothing there but in Iowa you so I'll I'll address that question with our guest the substance of so [noise]\nWell listen I mean yeah [laughter] definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to to look to move the money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is\nReally insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash in the coffers from a standpoint of we we the government reports that there is money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways that barring\nAgainst the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the always talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive uh the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nA with a baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created to ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retirement savings\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancements of modern medicine which are good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up and unfortunately this is just\nThe way that a government has unfortunately operated for decades not just recently more to come back in a moment\nFrom a viewer over ten thousand dollars in taxes ... tax returns we can help you take back control calling the experts at tax
