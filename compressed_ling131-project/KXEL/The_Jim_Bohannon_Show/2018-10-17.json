[noise]\n\nWhat was your vote out of showed one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killing series killing me ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and they were going to look a bit of just do what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the world war two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\nSure um after Iraq killing pat which became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover be has gotten a was an occupier in southern Germany\nUh before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from Baton and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe and your number and from killing I Want to actually fight them you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the AOL or did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people ... people\nTo spy against the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most of our human beings have it off the planet called Odessa\nAnd a family knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and he thought he can negotiate a separate pieces kind of crazy delusional stuff from him\nUh before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and he thought he can negotiate a separate pieces kind of crazy delusional stuff from him but he ... his organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of fashions within the organization and so they help\nThese guys are get out of Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened and also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped him\nA elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nA it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took him big guys which took it Eichmann andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Martin woman\nWho was died in Berlin as a as Hitler\nCommitted suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kinda we prove that in the book by dental work [laughter] so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nAnd I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... says people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nAnd you win the war to broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people who just ordinary people\nHey I was just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people put all that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it can happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican another's did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did ill and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after Adolf Eichmann\nThe they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and then adding that forced forced Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it who blackmailed and I'm\nA elements in the state department made it clear\nAnd we named the man I'm that if Truman didn't sign on the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest in the killing series\nKilling the ss and it is a a gang busters ... just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again on a number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing me ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about the mid term elections which we will do with Bill as well so a standby more to come on the show and just a moment\nCedar valley through the court oh this is the voice of eastern Iowa New song Fifteen points care the Waterloo Cedar Falls cedar\nRapids the choice of a lawyer is an important decision that should not be based solely on advertising\nBut at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff\nSo I'm a you know again it's impossible to predict there is anger\nBut there's also you know let me give you an example Jim and this is a pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed\nA writer for the call bear program put out a tweet that said okay well maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by ... said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff\nAnd certainly no one of my staff to bill O'Riley dot com I Would ever put out at tweed like that and keep their job because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and a mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who still working at cold air to no action against gay is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans of picking up\nThe picking at this progressive left the movement and teeth are the people they're dangerous\nAnd there's nothing in the world more tragically ironic that people calling themselves and anti fascist\nWho's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts for the Nazi movement I mean to call themselves ... fascist is just tragically ironic and and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony yeah\nThe good news is the good news is that there's not many of them the the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany and the late twenties and thirties they were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up every body that oppose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics are at the same same thing but in America you know a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nA lot of you [noise] yeah yeah so I took a\nQuick break come back with more from a Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

get in the benefit of doubt which we have to because there was no evidence to collaborate her claims are so many other ridiculous claims that they try to make and they tried to do this before\nBut ...

welcome pie Jim how fine thank you\nThat I was telling the lady is is your call screener I said I'm a Democrat but I did not agree with the way guys Kavanaugh's case was handled in fact I thought turned into the equivalent of a clown show and I don't think he got a fair ride and I think a lot of these\nDemocratic senators run for re election they're going to pay a heavy price loopholes or at least I certainly hope they do\nThey may allow me let me offer the rationale here and and this is not an excuse I Do consider it an excuse at all but I Do think that this was the reason you're talking about a number of Democrats who would not in the general course of things go down this path\nIn the Democratic establishment is feeling the thundering hooves the bows on the far left\nThe remember what happened to Joe Crowley the New York congressman beaten by uh uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nAnd then there have been other similar cases Dianne Feinstein of because of the California primary laws

said or until I give you the green light to make it public it just stinks to high heaven\nWell it's certainly it did I Would agree with you absolutely us think to the high it was a career that was a
