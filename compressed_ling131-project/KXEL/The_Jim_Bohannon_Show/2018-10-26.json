that they work in fact that it just\nCan make them safe\nWhile I was under the impression that they were not detonated so as that and to keep the components\nAre intact enough to ah to examine them I think that they were certainly diffused and I know the term that has been used by the the government potentially explosive devices which makes me wonder if they might not have contained explosives but we're not\nHooked up in such a way as to go off which would certainly explained why none of them did but I don't believe that that they were were detonated because you would be destroying evidence\nBy mistake well I I I think so yeah I was just what I was just wondering if there was you know if they had given information as far as how strong they were\nI've not heard any information about these things have to have been called\nA potentially explosive devices I found that term to be a rather intriguing in terms of government euphemisms potentially explosive devices\nSays to me that it's something that contains explosive materials but it's not hooked up in such a way that it would go off now that that could be reading more into it than the government intended but that's how it sounds\n... who cares said either well off for it it's still up\nA well it is at a steel is dangerous and all but it certainly matters in terms of how it was put together if for example\nLet's say I jam a bunch of uh oh diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate or something into a package like the Oklahoma City bombing\nBut I don't include any detonator or method by which it could be set off then that would be a potentially explosive device but it would not be something that you could expect to go off and that makes a lot of difference in terms of the the the motive of whoever was behind this\nOh yes sir I'm I don't know anything about five except cycle bull ... good good absolutely good\nWell good certainly uh in in in in terms of human safety and possibly good in determining a motive if you go to the trouble is sending out at a device that is designed not to go off\nAnd at least in the case of the Brennan package or including white powder that was described by the government as harmless\nThen you wonder what's going on here then that gives a lot of credence to the false flag notion that this was designed simply to a shake people up and not hurt anybody which would be
