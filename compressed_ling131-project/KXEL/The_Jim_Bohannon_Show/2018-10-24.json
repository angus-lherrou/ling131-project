currently columnist with the American spectator on lighted spectator dot org we're talking about the end of this intermediate range nuclear forces crazy which President Reagan had given polluted thirty one years ago with Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied on the mind of a blend who called them from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a show Glenn good evening\nTo you for like two or\nThree was President Trump's draw from the tree and then also a gentle comments about John Paul by the age of national security stood my comment is is I was in the military alter your seventies and eighties and I was a Persian to whistle ... and ... they would say\nThat the European Union is going to allow these intermediate range weapons that we may or may not produce there'll be put on their soil they scream bloody murder up all this ...\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations jet but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly knew where he raising a very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow\nA greater and medium range ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat\nAh there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange weapons to include an intermediate range of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we as\nTheir immediate ranger weapons include an intermediate range of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I had a violating type\nCruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do is my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense system but they're not perfect by any means they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack\nAnd that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think is to offset the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time and to perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as a star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing about the notion of a missile defense that is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles and the speed of computers\nAnd the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done I mean the question is how to get a better way we have systems right now are a strategic missile defense system station in California and Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight\nA we have the bad a terminal high altitude air to assist them a way out of batteries or and\nI think South Korea I Know we have other nations to I don't know if they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places uh you know these systems work\nThey're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put the money and and and invest in the science and engineering and get a systems to a point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from ... in the western Nebraska good evening Zach\nGentleman I'm calling in about the uh the boat meeting today with ... and a and a\nThan a little clip a quote of ... who was saying um about the American eagle eating all the ... and all we have left as the arrows\nAnd I want to back up and and just tell everybody I did vote for Donald Trump um and the reason I did that was because of the non intervention all uh aspect that he was portraying during the campaign or and I heard that term Neal con being thrown around [noise]\nAnd uh yeah I see that's exactly what's happening here and I I don't understand why we the American people continue to let these banker wars dictate our politics\nWhile we are allowing any quote banker wars to dictate any politics nor do I see anything in tonight's discussion Jeb that wouldn't be in reality a pulling back from war anytime you allow someone to aggregated treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't you\n... I mean even the Romans had his phrase for excused from power below that you want he's for war\nAnd that is really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate a tree and get away with it and whether or not we\n... the ... is a very different question and how we do it much better question so I don't know Jack ... by bankers sponsored wars of that that sounds a little little frankly paranoid to me\nWhile I Do is not I think of what we're talking about here tonight ended in fact what we are talking about tonight is not any kind of a\nOf intervention in third party affairs this is a treaty between the U.S and Russia or the successor stay to the Soviet Union and up it's every bit our business and to this particular\nUh item of business was probably long overdue one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nAs we talked to a jet Batman contributing editor to the American spectator deputy undersecretary of defense in the Bush forty one administration he writes the loose canons column board TAAS on line and is often the guest on this end to instill in their programs and they will be back on we'll be back in the moment\n[noise]\nVisual home of a un I Panthers is we've ... the Waterloo Cedar Rapids\nHoosier on this date update for October twenty third\nOf course but Mr Clinton making enforceable promised him on Jim Idaho you know it's like it's like Mr Obama drawing a red line I mean you ... shows night everybody's getting everybody's having a good time in ... the fast\nIn baseball parlance what I just said you was a batting practice pitch [laughter]\nThere you go All right below six six five oh did you run the subject of about places where ... ... my uh shall we say apply his own pressure that takes us two or three other portions of the former Soviet Union like Ukraine\nThe Baltic states of Estonia Latvia Lithuania were once Soviet socialist republic that is to say part of the Soviet Union not just a part of the Warsaw Pact but to actually part of the Soviet Union and the other like Ukraine\nThey are members of NATO which of course has re article by guaranteed an attack on what is an attack at all I have frankly frankly wondered if a NATO would be prepared to go to the match if let's say there was a Russian incursion Latvia\nWell I think the treaty would require I think for that reason alone I think that a ... not going to just directly attack a NATO member\nA used out a lot of but I don't think he is dumb enough to do that on the other and you might be crazy like a Fox and bet on the idea that we would not respond\n... Mr Obama say and twenty four team that we didn't have a strategic interest in Syria and again as as ... points out is a is book who knows ... there may be a lot of people in Russia solely headed there a military establishment that think\nThat indicates that we might not respond if something went on Eastern Europe as well so it's possible it maybe even true the poodle would believe that I don't

man with a lot of innovative ideas let's talk to a dog who calls a delight to from uh Pittsburgh Katie KIA ... evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jim thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about Pittsburgh gone through a similar transformation from having industry steel in the biomedical on banking cetera um\nAnd it's doing well the reason is doing well however the city school the Pittsburgh city schools struggle year after year fewer and fewer families are sending their students to the current public school they'll go anywhere else private school\nA Catholic school charter schools et cetera ... how is the Oklahoma City public schools\nAre they doing through the transformation the economy in your city\nWell it's it's a little inconsistent certainly\nWe're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City\nAnd so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but the largest district or is about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo I mean the urban public school setting it's still very much a distress situation across the country in Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools um adult around or you know that center part of the city\nAnd people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the ... issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kids\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools than at other options for kids but for for parents who want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city but I I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they been\n[noise] well most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are no no I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nA ... and um you know are like my one of my granddaughters attends a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a a board of our business leaders\nAre who you know kind of insurance success and um you know there's nothing magical about about the model\nIt's not that they have a bigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked her kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district\nOf but they've taken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is quite by an created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance of things could be working better I I\nLiked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYou know I I Know of course you're acquisition of the uh NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the opening of the new stadium where the Oklahoma City ran archer AAA a baseball team are sports franchise is a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become disgusted with the exorbitant demands from most sports franchise owners\n[noise] well it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is fear fear if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one\nIt is on a superficial level up a level of quality that she didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean there's so much but it does and and the fact that\nBut suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent is who your sports teams play\nAnd there's a level of quality but a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City and\nHaving a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job on on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes a pop culture and a major league sports team may chew culturally relevant dumbing one muscle Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players you know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered\nContracts by every other team in the league seemingly um that sends a message that this was a good place to live in ... I think that when sports starts to become\nTired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing one new facility after another new facility\nAnd so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nWere a break here that that does over here I'm going to finish your thought on sports teams in just a moment we'll be right back\nFrom a cedar valley through the more I Know this is the voice of eastern Iowa news talk to the point you want to lose your balls Cedar Rapids\nChampionship horseshoe pitching more from the Iowa almanac in a moment\nThe national debt is now we're ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars some experts say another crashes coming you can fight is now in stocks or bonds but we've gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCall eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now any five five eight five eighty five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nI used to post the job boards that sent me tons of resumes to find a few people who are right for my job metal process was not fired man I went to\n... to find the right people who've been actively invites them to apply the only getting qualified candidates\nMartin immigrants rated number one by employees in the U.S right now for free dot com slash free net difficulty dot com slash free zip recruiter smartest way to hire a central celebrating hiring number went on the radio\nWhen they need the senior care Iraq is no place like home in London when she had never had to give them anything at home heating aimed at night home care for your mom or dad at home I'm twenty four hours per day including personal care and\nMe I'm an ...

familiar with the problems in urban America he was a\nFour terms the mayor of Oklahoma City and he's the author of the next American city when you speak of be the next American city or how how next is that is this like a five years or ten years down the road or is this city a popping up right now\n[laughter] well you know cities and never reached their journey or at least the end of their journey they're always ...\nAnd what we're talking about is starting to purposely create inner city urban corps where young people could lamb and I\nAm an environment that has fewer automobiles um more pedestrian amenities and instill you know look at the quality of life and the cost of living\nUm and amenities field in that generation\nAnd it's you know it's hard to generalize 'cause every city stiffer\nBut almost every city out there in the category we're talking about some sort of urban revitalization taking place and young people are attracted to that there's an urbanization going on all over the world and midsize metros are capitalizing right now for the for the future\n[noise] while he's six six five oh jumbo return to a call from Brian in the Ozark, Missouri small town not that far

have we got to the shore if the flack will call your weight or maybe the ... fault those around her\nI don't think that the the New Madrid faults are impacted which is by the way based in southeastern Missouri a down the toward the roughly the Memphis\nThey needed ... votes or impact it which is by the way based in in southeastern Missouri a down toward roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma are your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nWell like I said I think he's just sitting there is a connection between the will and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so you know central Oklahoma was already out of all it was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists to work really hard they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a nerve ing earthquakes\nBut I think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas industry\nIt's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and most Oklahomans are thrilled that United States is in more control of its energy future going forward that we've been burned and oil and gas industry playing a major role in our caught\n'em but you know at some point their their technology it's got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring up the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out without causing harm on all the rest of us\nNow at the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much much uh uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered it of course the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in Nineteen oh seven\nOr ... at the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to energy or ... as it didn't affect diversified\nYeah uncle in the city has been supplied with this is talk and so Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the oil and gas student and as a result at its its economy and its tax revenues cyclical\nUm based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation right now\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking and made them a horror as shit industry a year with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas on the ground it's more technology driven and they get oil and gas that it was just the well used to ... or so the result of that as a as a business model\nA one day they'll pull and pull a fever people\nBut that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future ... we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I think the only gas industries you know it's there's been a wonderful job in creating a better resources for our country here the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on uh the sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is it one of those few urban areas which has an income tax even what what is the basis for Oklahoma City taxes\nWell most of our operations comes from a sales tax and most of our capital agents come from property tax\nThe uh the maps program as a little bit outside of the scenario I just described it it's for Apple projects as well but in general it's
