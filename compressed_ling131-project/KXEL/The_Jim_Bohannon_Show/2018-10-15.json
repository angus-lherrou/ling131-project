I've tried truck travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith ... with on and on the major three ways but then if you go to a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going to do go on the major freeways first and they wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you shouldn't start on the side roads because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get it on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on declare major uh uh interstate and then ... that if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all and say\nAll right well let's see what I think over because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me it really\nIs absolutely correct but in ... you know what the roads are so this way in case you have to watch those rows you should always be with us so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nSo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if you're in your area is let's say area that everyone knows you know the only to me that I'm On the other people that I meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major rose to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads but when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline\nIt's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say the ... let's say you're on a major artery and we are told that the ... place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey\nI'm taking this and the ... gonna do to through this direction to that location so this way family members who rely on\nThose

but if they had another tower that active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way\nAnd

waste but\nMaybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb too because you know because it involves a a a a trigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock hurricane out of kilter\nA I Am not sure about this but I Would dare say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal into hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other him practicalities of such an idea there's just too big and very\nWell you know let's put it this way let's say the United states has to say oh this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey went on to take this action and\nDo something with a store and the storm goes towards Alabama or Texas\nNow is the state of Florida are liable for this storm and damaging to states many other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and it goes straight to the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAll we liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the evil that it hits they've got to be upset\nYeah and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody would ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn them headed inland\nAnd the ... I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so uh the the fact is that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly up\nA little bit just simply change of course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and are you there could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more calls will be an athlete Kobe\nAnd his book is emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family has ... urgency prepping dot org you were one eight six six by boat jumbo back in a moment\nFrom a cedar valley through the court or\nThis is the voice of eastern Iowa loose on fifty more you want to lose Cedar Falls Cedar Rapids\n[noise]\nSecuring a mirror\nReally are better or in the middle of the water\nOr or or a ... year old wouldn't work because you wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nAnd that's not that's not necessarily true at all you may or may not you just simply have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that it's a you know twenty on the Richter scale of every structure and rode his flattened and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely go kid is always a handy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances\nOr your your advice for a gym would please Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean I Do is just that so let's say you are you have to abandon your vehicle and you have\nYour whole Trump's all go kids well you had your backpacking you carry what are the most essential\nA few days the food and medicine that other things that you can now walk and hide it to the next town or wherever it is that you have safe lodging or maybe even just they just sat nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know already start putting\nTogether what's happening now think about it that was the last ... that came so far in laws ... states now are starting to take seriously you know emergency management of these type of situation like in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back to back\nThey taking it seriously the money and management um each county each district each region the data itself\nI mean we moved I think it was seven to ... billion to hurricane to one that hit a\nI was it ...

uh\nIt's always been holders value for me uh it's it's really a\nStayed the same market terrier ate it in the last year and I was wanting to know if it if he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up go goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting gold gold has gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower them out\nSo I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and gold has not gone up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new kind of safety valve and even that have been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a platinum was kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker right way so none of the passion smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your service as well\nNow a this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just them during well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the founders arms raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it had a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum and let him\nRight but do you see a interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond bear market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bomb or interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute low was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just doing a brief explaining why interest rates are going beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not an empire for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month for the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening some when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the evidence that we have are being financed with that\nThen the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in aid that just that corner around today there are options of the thirty year bond that ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and we don't go up and prices go down\nThere you go you'll to supply and demand thing\nMore supply less demand wheels and we'll go up and prices go down\nAnd then there you go you'll to supply and demand thing All right we're going to go back and talk some more we will certainly return to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about do when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nWhat eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one

bowling to her back and so I I mean ... it it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a
