learned will get down to whether or not we have a limited but but out of this debacle but we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now\nIs the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president ah you know you asked in back in a way that may be pass administrations would have been cold\nAnd I think the Nicole the strategy of the left has never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay from behind the nominee\nOr that the pressure would be so great that ah he would have to draw or she would have with Charles himself and so in the face of these vicious attacks on them and as\nA stellar reputation had an amazing where's the jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservative stood their ground\nAnd the right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a less than ... sword chew have courage and the conviction that uh our leadership in D.C are dared represented\nIn reality can you foresee a time and let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee a will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\n\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that and my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to bipartisan consideration that used to be traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes\nThe last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up what uh\nChest is this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to sicker judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being harmed not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail is for all the law and the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully and uh the last attempt to to hit these ... cases to create brand new rights and brand new ah protections that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice band with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for the law law or that there won't be so much at stake and she won't have hundreds of people getting arrested the capital open to nominate\nBecause we won't be in such a high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on

fight for the the ... right\nI Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary has essentially governments umpire calling balls and strikes that's constitutional that's not constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there unfortunately who don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care what the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the veterans so on [noise]\nAh they don't care about that sort of thing and they care only about getting their way and if that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them or not in many cases talking about very principled

regulation and decrease in size empower the government being sought\nInch by inch every step along the way are but here I think in a way the judiciary is being transformed it's putting men and women in place that have that commitment at are rejecting this idea that\nYou know every court case needs to be a policy that tree out we just have a court case that is correct or the wall and that's what we expect to play ball\nWell I'm certainly with you ah of course if that would have happened we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nTo feel that way and and that's
