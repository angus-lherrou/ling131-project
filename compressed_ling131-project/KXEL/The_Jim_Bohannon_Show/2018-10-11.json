of the of our lives even if I\nMay be investing or or playing various a market games or or not or shall we say your hobby but the fact is that we all our economic beings to one extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's money answers mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim uh or remember one night a night\nOf very for those who don't know that Steven news in the same unit I was in Vietnam but to go ahead\nYeah but you are or suffer and\nI I was I was actually enlisted also but anyway what do you have it for what do you have for our for our guest\nAbout gold but it's always been for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a\nState they're saying or get terrier ate it in the last year and I was wanting to know if it if he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes now as many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting gold gold gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announce\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars now it's even lower than that\nSo I I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and gold is not throwing up it's just not what it used to be if anything the currents become a new kind of safety valve and even that have been working my way as well so have a little bit as an insurance policy but I don't say go during up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a ... kind of a of a place a play on a catalytic converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker wait wait so none of the national smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your services well\nNow a this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although in some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these like we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean defenders arms race race a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has not over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nRight but do you see a interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond there market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute low was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher ... let me just during a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds known that buyer for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bonds sixty billion a month the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's what our for about a year and a half now and now they're doing quantitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim we've talked about this before but the evidence that we have are being financed with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars need that just that corner alone today there are options of the thirty about the ten year bond they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nBuilds and builds go up and prices go down\nAnd then there you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to the more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nOne eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answers man is our guest Jordan good again money ... dot com a
