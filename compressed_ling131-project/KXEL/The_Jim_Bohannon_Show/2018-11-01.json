down or sitting in for a gym and and that's a doctor Eastleigh and it's just a fine I found them filled up to the other day in this tremendous tremendous knowledge\nBase and you know strategically I don't know this is helping Republicans by President Trump a week before the election going into this because the media is not going to give it a fair hearing it's a little bit more complicated than they make it\nAnd uh you know it's distracting and some Republicans are afraid of it but I think he's accurate now\nIt's gotten so bad and I want it to be really careful and this I'm going to play you some sounds from a New Jersey TV reporters and Jay TV\nIt's about a year or so ago they did in ... on a hospital now I remember seeing this in the west coast New York area this was in Jersey a metal in a hospital\nA Meadowlands hospital yes marketing US citizenship and childbirth services to Russians and they called it are you ready\nAmerica mama Mehra mama A. M. E. R. I. mama\nAnd they called it are you ready\nAmerica mama I'm Mira mama A. M. E. R. I. mama America mama\nAnd for this you get top flight medical care allegedly if you come here from other countries and since we have the fourteenth amendment come on down you'll get citizenship for the kids are dual citizenship\nOr listen to this reporter the anchor and the reporter on N. J. T. V. break down what they were doing according to these news reports at this medal way in hospital over in the New York New Jersey or New Jersey area here's out samples\nWhere there is a relatively unknown international phenomenon known as a birth tourism blue\nForwarded last night Meadowlands hospitals a narrow ... program in taxes putting that Russia has to deliver their babies here making the baby is eligible for US citizenship the story was broken by ... spotlight health care reporter ... state and and her team thank you for being here\nGreat piece of work it took a nine month how didn't show even being care to start investigating this well\nWe are at camp like a like a story it came from a tap from somebody who had to let's say on a laptop static thing [laughter]\nOkay so you got it\nAmerican mama\nThis is how bowl birth tourism you come here and are you a the service called America mom it promotes tour packages that offer to coordinate medical services it by the way in the hospital held the family establish a comfortable life in the area for up to six months\nOr Russian language website was active for more than a year and taken down a promise to secure citizenship papers passports travel visas for the baby for fees ranging from eighty five hundred to twenty seven five depending on the level of assistance in Bob's\nFamily generally return to their home countries after giving birth their babies can eventually enjoy the benefits of American or dual citizenship and parents have the right to apply for residency after several decades plus the quality of medical care better in the ... I mean can you imagine out blatant essays\nAnd all these regulators all these Jersey right that they're not looking at this though\nNow here is um Tucker Carlson last night on his Fox show making a point because Paul Ryan and Ryan's I've had on my show several times in Philadelphia is good on some economic issues but on illegal immigration and things like this he's very very weak he's a problem\nHere says some Asian because Trump and Paul Ryan had been going back and forth on this birthright citizenship\nHere's what Carlson said taking it to another level a bigger level about what this is about with the Koch brothers and Paul Ryan and some of the Republican elites and you if you object to things like this birthright citizenship here's Carlson obviously\nAnd some people say when they don't feel like making a rational taste for their positions usually because they can't really quote obvious that the constitution requires us to get citizenship to the children of illegal aliens Paul Ryan has no idea just doesn't want to have a conversation about it he wants to be quiet\nYeah that's exactly right Carlson again tonight I made this point it's more of what some of these elites and certainly the Democrat Party but some of the Republican about some the rights and all the rest of it of people coming into the country illegally for whatever purposes that they have\nVersus the rights of the average American and this is what the Trump campaign was about echoing that it wasn't just illegal immigration\nIt was lack of manufacturing take you know on the Chinese global is all those things that's the core of it that's what the debate is they don't want to engage in the debate they just want to call names\nI read the fourteenth amendment pretty clearly no I'm a law school dropout I got into talk radio with a year left in law school but I can tell you the fourteenth amendment clearly was not about this and I love what professor Eastleigh instead of how we may have gotten to this\nIt was about trying after the civil war and all that carnage to stop the southern states from denying some form of citizenship to former slaves that's what it was about it's clear just like Lincoln the film we need to film that's what it is\nYou know what that's the idea that Lincoln film I Love whether it's true or not Tommy Lee Jones the whole thing I'm\nDaniel Day Lewis it's tremendous\nAnd you know Lincoln by hook or by crook was determined to get the thirteenth amendment so that the Emancipation Proclamation wasn't just a piece of paper\nWe need a film about the fourteenth amendment I don't know what the title is I don't know who should start you can help me out a series make a film about that\nWould really be about people coming here illegally or would it be that still the south well up until civil rights acts and\nThings of that nature Jim Crow laws but this was even worse okay the states will determine who's the citizen were not ever going to say these people are citizens that's\nWhat this was put in to do not\nSet up a mirror mama I'm marrow mom can you imagine\nHaving New Jersey not see that until n J TV got it because it's going on over the place they don't care maybe they even support it why would we do that just think of how obnoxious people flying in here yeah we'll get dual citizenship and medical care and all the rest\nNo you don't that's not what being an American citizen you can't buy that you have to commit to it\nSo help me out what what should the film be called\nAround this I guess a Lincoln was gone and so we don't have that seminal figure we've got to work with that a little bit here but we'll we'll make it work [noise] uh my name is Tom junior Dana producing a film here of sorts for the fourteenth amendment [noise]

[laughter] [laughter] what's going on [laughter]\n\nI'm coming here [laughter] [laughter] oh [laughter]\nI Know what I liked about this is too many pounds on both sides both sides we never get clearly where one says I'm going this and the other says I Want that I'm good with that then people can decide this little weasel going back and forth I mean they I guess they should've bludgeon them a few more times\nHe clearly doesn't believe this guy should get the death penalty so he's prominent off to the face but what about in Pennsylvania what about under Pennsylvania law you want to tell us our risk this is as governor protecting citizens do you want the death penalty yes or no he clearly does just the man and say it\nLed citizens decide do they want a governor that's going to sign death words yes or no\nNo I Will always be in favor the death penalty with those ... that I told you they think the only thing that stops me is I Want to be absolutely certain as we possibly can that's why this is such a good case because I don't see how there was any doubt here although he deserves his day in court\nIs rights and the whole let's just do it quickly let's get his lawyers let's give him the full benefit and if you're even this guy if you're on trial for your life you get the very best that's what we ought to do because it's that serious that being said\nThere's no mistaken identity everything is here wealth should he get the death penalty yes or no you know if you're opposed to the death penalty being man step up and say no you shouldn't I'm never going to be in favor the death penalty\nFine I just would like to know why does the obfuscate like this could it be thinks people in Pennsylvania really are in favor the death penalty or you want a proud on about how horrific things are but then even this case doesn't get the death penalty\nEight six six fifty Jim ... I'll be clear about this too it doesn't take a risk case like this my standard is is you take a life in cold blood fulfilling the requirements of first degree murder you get the death penalty whether it's a big mouth like me whether it's an innocent baby mother ... it doesn't matter\nAll life is precious if you take it you're getting the death penalty\nUnder law under those guidelines that I get why it's so difficult to say if you don't agree with that fine then I don't want you as governor of ... you need to sign up for it's eight six six fifty ... that'll get you on board down to your data
