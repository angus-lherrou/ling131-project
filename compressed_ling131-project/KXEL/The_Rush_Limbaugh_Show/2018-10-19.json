drugs yeah um so I I report in a two year with a little bit of caution the caravan of Honduran migrant except turned around today a day after reaching that might go walk the amount of border\nAccording to a report what's the oceans poster poster\nIt's an AP story the or some four thousand migrants fled their lives of poverty and violence in the Central American country with the hope to make if they were born papers nothing about this is organic he looked Trump's right to ask who's paying for this who is mindless food\nWho is buying the water and distributing and who's paying for the gasoline for the vehicles being used\nWhere are these people are taking care of hide and Jenny\nRequirements for those of us real into where they pulled me\nTrump was not to be a garner a before now I I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on the part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around ... pay or is there a ... left Saudi Arabia after having met when king's home mom and Mohammed bin some on the crown prince seasons flute and may call\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put

keep paying for those people to go wherever they go next\nAre they going to go back to Honduras they're going to go back to Guatemala are they going to go to holding places in weight\nTo try to do the

those are pretty well I hear you pretty well\nThey keep a you know I'm a Trump voted for Trump Avon Trump voter and America First and most historic sense then I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question here\nHow can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty or the woman on a fair can you clear that are falling\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the ... the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know an Jonathan Pollard he was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted it back\nOn harmed and we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and like I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spy 'cause we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd a particular when Democrats or the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that if it was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\n\nI remember I was talking to William F luckily junior about number thing not just this my brought that up\nAnd I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it ever doing anything I was I don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally\nAnd yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia or you are you saying the Saudi royal family\nIs behind this I said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi\nOf the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's when I started asking experts are at at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shake case\nAnd it was Andy who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism daily with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it\nRight this is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he told me was so when\nYou realized that the Saudi royal family\nIs in charge\nOf world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and a Medina Medina\nI've found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind why this long well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I ... just to make it easier here and being understood terrorists Islam comes from ... from those you heard me say this yesterday I beg your indulgence\nWow how the Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into there in very mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family stood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating you don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world\nPromoted while hobby is and that's what I went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin ...\nMohammed bin ... wants to know if we didn't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is\nSolely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out he wants other people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is me I'm a ... word abandonment or and be a distant thing from ...\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show me again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in enemy hammock cut pretty much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina aren't they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nThe death of shaggy this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family and they may have a council you might I often wondered well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different why they've got kids with every one of their wives so a Saudi king can have twenty sons\nHow do you determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just\nI saw Saudi king can hit twenty sons allergy determine which one's the crown prince how diseases Herman which one's going to be his air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the winning edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen saw mom Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says if the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on his crown prince\nKnow many people think that this is up to the king the king determines what your his sons is going to be the next king but it's not the case so\nAll of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cavity up all these plans for reform\nWhen we expose their secrets in fact there are ways you can become
