the nature of the ... what sex talk all safe talk what was the Ixtoc\nWell it was a it was it was my way of illustrating absurdity by being absurd [noise]\nUm that occurred back in Nineteen eighty four eighty five and and back then and safe sex was all the rage\nFor a number of reasons not spreading STDs and not getting pregnant and therefore not needing abortions a abstinence which works every time it's tried was being laughed at and the Pooh poohed as unrealistic you can't say just don't do it does not give a guy in Tucson that so safe sex\nA came up and it basically meant to use a condom so I thought that I Would ah demonstrate the folly\nOf this belief\nBy demonstrating safe talk and what I did was over a series of days that is due wants first that grabbed a condom and I stretch that type of place that on the microphone\nWe have photos of this thing take the proven this before there were ... but the sound effect of the condom being placed the microphone was a mistake of all\nAnd then after the condom was in place to demonstrate safe talk I Would I'd asked what do you think now if I say anything to the fans you that this condom will protect\nIf I other profanity if I start engaging activities you don't want to hear as well this condom protect life sort of course it will because I'm engaging in safe talk just like they are encouraging us to be safe sex\nAnd that's that's what he was talking about and of course there were additions and a additional aspects to it as it happened it wasn't just a\nOne time that it had a point to make so was ongoing and then then then that
