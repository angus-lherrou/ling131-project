them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country over the last\nUh two a a sixty years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is\nUm I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to do anything could be it would be icing on the ... I think their primary objective now is the flood zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democratic Party and then there's like combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSomebody of the focus I think is on ... up a first time participation um and that's why this this enthusiasm thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the\nAnger is so that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout based on what they think is the majority of Americans to paint Trump\nI I think they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nNow I think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing the news as I Do\nMore and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave\n\nAnd there are some big brush them ... during this on purpose they're sucking you went in there making you think they are given up they're making you think we've printed despair either trying to make you think you got it in the back no they're not going to ever\nPull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are when they have that much discipline to be able to have media wide throughout the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nWilling to put that out there and I if I ended up being wrong so be it\nI'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but in this I have never thought that was common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in a way in outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on an even\nTwo thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop drop on even they're stupid travel uh order delays using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do yet like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think of all of these things were true but I'm people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret the Trump is ... ... ... the Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it\nIf the Democrats are right about all this but they're not write about it but I I'm I'm\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are forced to fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nAnd ... with their their mentality David says winning is their birthright power their birthright their entitlement but\nElections haven't been going their way me how in the world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary wonder ones in the first temple to never won in the first place if all\nThis talk of a blue wave right now is true they thought they had it in the bag and two thousand sixteen and they were ribs and energized too there was one of the talk of Democrats not turning out
