unusual happened on the Senate floor today every senator was there [noise]\nUsually on these boats [noise] on on Hanukkah come in and out when they were they like half of what it was empty when the vote started and and the Democrats began to violate\nThe law here folks ah eight hundred to eight to ... to if you want to be with us today the email address is ... ... S C I be net dot us [noise] I sure would be a little story here it's something that happened on the M. S. [noise] can be seen today\n[noise] uh see what can I just put the bottom of the stack it's about somebody I very rarely comment on 'cause I don't care as phony folk conservatives his name is Jennifer Ruben [noise]\nAh yeah it is Jennifer Rubin it's amazing that transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just the died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has the there's still the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point\nI couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name she says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes a little deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the email Democratic senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if it's their\nTime of the month does anybody think that would fly there is no way a male commentator\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly that\nAfter a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the mid term but words in her study of things\nJust continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nDon't know why I Would think it would be but she says it's not\nKavanaugh however has provided the catalyst because of how Trump voters the purse and specifically the conservative populace coalition perceive the way he's been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populists coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they edit things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range hence somewhat diminished until cabinet came along and re awaken these people and fired them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell\nWhat happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it helped to remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from Kevin all by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy is high now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen thousand Eighteen midterms now where I looked she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think the people who voted for Trump are deeply involved in things now\nMaybe there are some exceptions and you had some people who voted for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump\nVoters did so for very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which the\nPound it every day multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild the military bring back the economy\nI Would think people that voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people are voting for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\n\nBut as her insistent know that kind of stuff it evaporates and wanes you know people's lives go on the news changes but the this Kavanaugh circus has re ignited the coalition that electing Trump and this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate could indeed say a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nI found it interesting analysis and I wanted to share it with you she points out that Democrats are spending money in the house races out there like we've never seen before and that Republicans aren't and that leads me to another point that I Need to make but I don't have time right now hang on we'll be\nBack and listen to talk radio host he died a man's word on [noise]\nSay
