teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose\nAnd I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red wave I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that\nIn terms of survival uh and safety because I think if the Democrats do not win the house and then if you listen to scuttle but sounds like everybody's preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expanded their hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one

about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find a\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kittens in his basement in a cage\nAnd the FDU cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand them the first order and you\nKnow officer you know our government\nIs separating the two parents that are born or I don't see them\nAnd the cops we fought

block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional that the statute in America today says families will be separated\nManaged to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching\nThe parents are shoveled off as the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see\nA guy who any under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement
