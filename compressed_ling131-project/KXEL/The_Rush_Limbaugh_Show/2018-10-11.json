been lived in a either a flat line for a shrinking economy that we have heart and you know let's not forget something for most of that time in the last\nEight years prior to Trump people like you were also told that this was as good as it going get that you had to have a comment and acknowledge that there was a new normal now and that America's\nGreat days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and ended this this was more like the way it's going to be now\nYou will also told not only were you in a flat lining economy you were told don't have any lawfully expectations here right ... exactly\nHow how let's jump forward to this growing economy my next question are you actually there's no wrong answer here it's not a trick\nAre you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living and experiencing it are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI Am\nIn a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate economy so I'm aware of it via information but I can I can feel it I can sense that\nI can I I Know that it's true that it said that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life\nAnd and I literally feel like the finances in America there's been a ... hold on to this depletion of it

was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other problems\nExactly right but the point is your ... your your living economy you're you're not just saying and thinking it's because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it\nWell I I mean ... and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because people want to act like oh well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later oh hey real skill\nAll that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole other subject\nWatery lottery winners at
