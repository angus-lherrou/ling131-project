the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters not that the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months in the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by\nTrump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive by is ushering everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gonna be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls could be missing a GOP surge elite syringe and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump put fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick them up or at least some of it it's a good reminder of even mid October surveys can missile late change the story written before the bombs could it happen\nThey start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this\nThis mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a tweet here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue he and his time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose\nThere is a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop posing Trump just to opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the child comes folks\nA lot of people in our side have jumped say George C\nSway it also means Iran and the ... folks\nAnd a lot of people on our side that jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying is Venezuela if it's Venezuela that's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats didn't think they have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security there's still some help us\nA modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us whatever now do you say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this\nPanning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but\nI I don't think that going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing maybe a conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary group think narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now the argues electing Democrats not in mass\nMaybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat to even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's a bore he tweets he's a bad guy here's whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying cabin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing that Democrats are doing\nThat the kind of thing you do to build a move was in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege every day are decent society\nStandard good old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop culture and leftist in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media where under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because they they even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people who voted against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts you're not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters and they're the ones panicking so you flip the scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of
