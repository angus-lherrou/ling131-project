um it's not really happening and when people mention anything that triggers a stress response\nIt really isn't the the stress or that's the problem it's helping people to manage their own ability to

psychological and psychiatric sea hawks\nOh yeah Oh absolutely\nSo that does that bias does bring in someone who is very much a progressive or liberal um they will certainly be affected by what's going on okay\nLet me ask you this I'm a you may not be able to tell me this because of a a patient client or a confidentiality I'm not asking a names but what what percentage of the people\nWho are coming to see you for help are in fact out of kilter because of politics not maybe Trump per se or any other personality but just politics in general how many of them are in a state of confusion or stress just because of politics\nSays zero percent zero percent yup zero percent that's it 'cause\nNot coming in with for that as the they have other things to do they're worried about you know their families are they're going through a divorce or they have anxiety or depression about other things or they were traumatized [noise] um\nLet's see two liberals all of that is Trump spoiled [laughter] because he got elected and he's president it's all his fault\n[noise] that you know it's it's interesting one of the things that helped me here it's the right was psychology when I was learning it because um when people come in my office NASA have terrible child\nAnd and maybe it's legit they were little mistreated they were abused I can sympathize with an appetizer and I can say that was horrible now we have to do the work of getting past it and continuing to blanket or doesn't help\nAnd having the attitude that somebody else must change in order for me to feel better there's
