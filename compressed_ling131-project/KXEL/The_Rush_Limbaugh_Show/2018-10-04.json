lying they don't report their their opinions they don't come to any conclusions they simply filed with three ... and they send them up to the Senate and the White House the Senate gets one copy and you know why that is\nBecause Obama\nAnd Patrick Leahy who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee back during one of the uh the Obama terms agree to that is\nThe Democrats the Republicans on Obama agreed that FBI reports like this would be submitted to the Senate only one copy so that senators can't walk out with it and the leak it they're going to leak it any way that is already started\nTo happen but the and the Democrats know this this is this is another example of how they just simply why this is not being just disingenuous they're lying\nEvery devout Christian thinks the Bible is the key and the more people read it and understand it obviously the better\nNot Christianity was originally confined to very small circle of people in Jerusalem\nAnd it went from a small little movement to a well what was most popular religion\nAnd it is fascinating story how that\nHappened which she attempts to explain in the book it's called Jesus Says resin\nAnd it's about the birther Christianity using the book of acts it's all in the book of acts fault I mean when I say it's all there it is I mean it's not a substitute for reading the Bible but if the book of acts it's all there\nSo he uses the book of acts and six New Testament pistols as the introductory guide here\nAnd get people who want to read the Bible butter intimidated by up to actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you finish this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start\nAnd you'll be more likely to stay with it in\nDetails the suffering and the sorrow the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures in Christianity following the death and resurrection and the central Jesus Christ which\nIf the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity does it exist that and and that's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that didn't you can't physically put your arms around that\nResurrection from the dead but it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any names liberal talk show host really were raising a Christian\nYou really believe that camp you know that's why you people are not you can't really think that somebody died came back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell\nFor Christianity to be one of the news that had to happen and my brother David is a devoted to helping people believe that has happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept once in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this is it well it it's it's not simply a primer it's its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nTo be sort of like an introduction\nTo the Bible and to Christianity\nBoth testament but this focuses on the book of acts because that's where it all is men don't just read the book X. forget everything else but it's all there in the book
