other things\nThere's less and less for his team of Trump haters to what to do I'll just repeat what I had at the very opening in the program I don't think this tax story would have run today if\nMueller we're still hot on the trail and had something and if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story when ... when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times during my first react because remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left\nAnd nothing happens by accident the times didn't just finished the story\nBy deadline last night there by making it able there'd be published they'd been holding it they've been working\nOn it for a year and they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past\nYear documenting how the times found it how they reported it how they\nPrompted how they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today first reaction I had was the capital thing must really be unraveling as it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle\nAnd it's not really new its taxes the latest news correct me on this ... if you've seen somebody more\nRecent but the last story I saw on this is that Mahler [laughter] I don't know what to believe in it if that Muller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\n\nWe're down now to Roger Stone\nIn an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump keeping with\nRussia and Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important\nThat enable Trump to hold onto his money and get more But Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity what Russia will there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\n[noise] so [noise] um [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty I've ... the you know ethics say that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election or the cause of the impact that it would have and they of\nCourse are ah unbiased and it's only jak given the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections [laughter] which is all they've\nBeen trying to do it for two years [noise] I wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude experience in for having a really really shady friends and all that but doesn't accused him of anything\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen is the way these people operate but but maybe it won't\n\nOutside of that I'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to be a lot of what he's going to report um zip zero not at all I Know is\nThat the drive by media have decided to try to make something else a
