you think that\nThe way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to find the entire Supreme Court\nWhen they don't get their way bingo\nThat men don't met that lake

worthless and even a liability to the point now that here we had a soundbite with two women experts in gender studies saying\nDo we need white women it's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand to eleven the Obama presidential campaign this was written about by a Thomas Edison all in the Washington Post\nMight have been in New York Times\nOn down that they were for going the white working class as a voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of a sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base because white working class voters were becoming less and less\nDependable because they weren't by an Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc they\nExpress no ... this is simply an evolution of that\nSo I'm a white working class was totally go pounds

this crap and since most people are not what they wish they were most people are not as successful as they ... want to be\n[noise] most people do think about what they don't have rather than what they do\nAnd if that's who you are if that's if that's the personality type and it's not very big step to start blaming somebody else for what you don't have becomes very easy to blame some faceless patriarchy some faceless white privilege power structure some faceless\nBunch of me and he's the uprising you denying you discriminating against you\nSaw the left has to do is get hold of the people
