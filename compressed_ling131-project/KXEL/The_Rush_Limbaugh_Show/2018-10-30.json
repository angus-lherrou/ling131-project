the phones times we just want to hear to Richmond, Virginia this is ... and ... and a welcome happy to have you here with us all\nThank you so much for taking my call today Russian thank you for all you do I just wanted to make a quick point that's a hard left and the media and the especially Hollywood and I think it has been engaging in gas lighting the right\nWould you expect when you just find that I hear so many people use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting I'm the most common example is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this child in the family to take care of all of the sticking in terms\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about then they sneer at then especially when people aren't looking and then at that person dares to get angry oh look look\nLook at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make this entire narrative and what they believe rush it that that person is an idiot they're not even\n... numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and when everybody else is is the

one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you it isn't\nIt used to work like a charm and on many people still\nDoes we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to no end when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years or indicates that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris Rock I gotta I gotta you know I'm On Fox News Sunday\nTwice a year during ratings month [noise] and Chris Wallace is always\nVery polite and exceedingly nice and asks me to make sure to tell you not to get mad at him for interrupting me because he doesn't he would never get a question and after we ask the first one\nSo I got a note from a golf buddy who watched this past Sunday man this guy wall as you say he's a good guy but this guy's going so far left I don't know if I don't know if I couldn't believe what you tell me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happens well it clearly wasn't this\nOn Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast in front page headlines from a Washington Post the day after Steve ... was shot in Alexandria, Virginia by Bernie Sanders supporters with the Washington\nPost headlines following the capture of mail bomb mastermind\nAnd Trump supporters ... and not surprisingly the post made sure to emphasize that say aughts political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shot up ... was not mentioned\nPolitically at all and it's Chris Wallace holding use to headlines up and pointing it out let's say I can line red bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump\nWallace said that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read something like suspect arrested\nAnd closer inspection of a article finds that it does not even mentioned that ... was the bombing suspect until the fourth paragraph\nInstead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy talking about his support for Trump and all of stickers on his band\nBut on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings sadly congressman shot in Virginia and didn't mention his name it didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention\nUm anything infected foot noted his support\nFor Sanders\nAnd it barely like one of the asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump\nSo here's Chris Wallace holding up the obvious evidence of media bias here that he said surprised him\nAnd later on in the in the show adjacent Riley andme a Wall Street journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media this is why\nThese two headlines or why ... why you write you talk to every day Donald Trump is the only Republican tweeting\nOr informing people about the success of his policies everyday stock market going Trump's tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets it every day what ever the economic noses or whatever the successes that his agenda is administration is having he tweets\nAnd if it weren't for him it wouldn't be out there are other than us of course here or in so called alternative media but but but the boy is the Republican Party is not even touting the Trump administration's agenda successes Trump alone is doing it\n\nAnd that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it in and I hope we never does but when I when I realized\nThis that Trump is the only guy like today there are a couple of tweets Trump tweeting the consumer confidence as being at a record high and and relating to how can people be voting Democrat when this kind of great economic news has been in the news of the day for two\nYears there's all kinds of Republicans running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats [noise] thirty five thirty six Senate seats where\nHe is I don't ... McDaniel is out there tweeting some things out now but where is the party in general touting itself\nAnd its achievements and you don't see it other than from Donald Trump\nAnd he's not whining about that he's unabashed aide just tweets about and ah and gas and he reached the truth out about the media as they report on him and lie\nOr distorts or what have you but there is an incredible incredible series cops success stories\nThat at any time in the past would have been a great help and ... and assistance in running for election or reelection\nGreat news that would portray and show the Republican Party and a great light and Trump's it for the most part\nI mean really when you stop to think about it because it's such a one man show in many regard as such such a missed opportunity\nThe consumer confidence news I mean how can even be with all the news you see every day if you tune into any drive by outlook even reading the drudge headlines you would think we're on the verge of imploding and yeah\nConsumer confidence is it an all time high well that's a reflection of how people living literally living\nAnd their and their their thoughts on the future and his role bust positive how can that\nBe if everybody's running around miserable and in the various stages of Faisal is a more defeat\n\nIts it's important to a very uh being positive is a hard thing to do in any circumstance were not hard wired for human beings are hard wired for pessimism I've discussed this many times human beings have a natural tendency to defeat ism and failed is because it's easier", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "30"}
