... words are\nBut if it's if it's a grass they save the geo paved ... that would that would indicate that grass lately I really don't want to go there I don't want to assume Grassley said until I have one he actually said I'm not going to even speculate\nNor the way the media is reporting on of his save the GOP means it was over we were in we were I mean we were headed for the gigantic ... we're going to lose everything and then that Kavanaugh thing happened in a caravan thing I might save the GOP\nThere are other people saying well if it was going to save a GOP it didn't because all of

like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they say that Kavanaugh situation that Democrats blew that sky high and sort of oh man this is really going to help them then the pipe bomb and the sooner guys shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation or\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost located we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who\nDid it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurt Democrats or Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story with the way I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul rape by Kevin ... if the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being ... and the longer\n\nAnd they answered the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess if\nWe need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon they real murderers in America the real problem is white men we've got a

cabinet got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist because it was all made up about capital\nClassic Democratic Party media operation\nSo is the

people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nNow we were much newer and younger country but him and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they'd be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in had\nTo demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America it wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be playing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you have to promise that you were going to do your best to learn the English language if it was restricted because it was predicated and based on the fact that we weren't in charge of who was going to live here\nThe world was not in title it was entirely different vantage it back then but even then\nI read books I remember conversations with my grandfather who lived to be a hundred and four he was born in Eighteen nineties\nHis life\nSpanned pre electricity\nAn Eighteen nineties his life\nSpanned pre electricity they're going to the moon in his life he saw all of that he grew up on a farm and to go while feels before school every day\nCome home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what they got to eat um\nHe was one of the first in his wedding it was the first to ah to go to college became a lawyer\nBut he\nCame from the horse and buggy days and no electricity to manned spaceflight landing on the motives thought all and I remember\nI was I was home in Missouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after program I guess would be Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he's around Ninety these these are close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big thing is [noise] it was hard of hearing but it's not as you could have here to radio easily so one of the big things being discussed on your program say immigration\nWe call the pop pop you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run\nThis was this was folks this was all them back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know\nI remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA polarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to impugn new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe ever people as his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying back in the early Nineteen hundreds away they've you know the controversy then was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration there were people opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity that come in\nAnd for reasons similar to intercept the day\nThe differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both political parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for Lawson is advocating for illegal immigration\nAnd then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship for amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what they are the Democrats in the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that\nAmerica is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we as a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and taking what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so\nIn liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy and then somebody has to be poor out there and so therefore the American people are guilty of something\nThere was an unequal distribution of wealth the left says in all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us and it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion\nAnd the real purpose behind that is to transform America and to the kinds of nation that was never intended are found to debate and that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration the subject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but\nThe idea that illegal immigrants have legal claim on whatever they want in this\nCountry that's that is what's new and the education they make so many young people think that that's just the thing\nIs also relatively new\nMost powerful man in talk radio leaky
