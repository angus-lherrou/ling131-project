I prefer to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not have it all gets through I think the whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em bugs don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi TV was on the BBC it was on Russian television\nI think even the north Korea as the little pot belly dictator mentioned it in his Saturday Night message to the people it was everywhere when Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to take it in the short everybody in the media covers it\nAnd I again I made that production at a at a time where it looked like they were getting ready to bail\nOn the entire\nNomination and when that didn't happen when the Democrats won a couple of steps too far and caused the Republicans do engage them and then I revise the production so I'm gonna take a brief time out here um [noise] I've got\nThe Trump soundbites from the press conference in the rose garden following as announcer the

here we're going to get back to the phones now people that are waiting patiently for a long time anyway so we'll go back to Washington DC we'll glad you called or what's happening\nTo us because it's a pleasure to be here um I work at your thoughts on on the ethical issues of the front page if you recall during the uh doctor court testimony the prosecutor asked her how to put her legal fees and her security on as you mentioned her go find me page and those three pages of ... billion dollars\nAnd I have to be some kind of ethical issue what you could accuse somebody without any kind of corporate evidence\nAnd then go public with that and raise you got that amount of money is a very very properly thought if there's a lot of weird and friends are there for people to make contact you raise your basic triggered waves there are a lot of money by your your crowd crowdsource\nLook this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are a range lunatics who want her to be right\nWho hope she's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell his true they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw cabinet they're happy to pay for it is it\nCan you to speak and tell his true they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw Kevin they're happy to pay for it this\nIs how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than having to pay it doesn't matter to them that she can afford her lawyers yourself it doesn't matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case\nSo she's identified a market there are people that want to support her with money so she starts to go and find me page I actually think somebody sent me an email\nToday to to go ... go find me is not new money laundering is essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were ah make us\nWhereas a lot of this money going to go a lot of this money is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to be when they're already involved\nAnd Democrat Party politics so it's just it's a it's a new form of fund raising that's not call fundraising miss is made to look like people supporting have been dragged golden and\nFalsely accused a stressful\nReally in bad shape woman who can barely barely get through the hearing terrified they're happy to help\nAnd I you know this ... she's not the only one using a ... there's a lot of Republicans or get into that a lot of people\nWho are using go fund me pages to raise money for their legal bills and other expenses\nAnd if you can convince the American people to support you\nWell I mean there's there's a I don't think there's anything immediate that can be done to stop it and I don't think that you can draw any conclusions about\nHer from it um in terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw a conclusion that the Gulf ... pages I'm I'm a way to get Democrats suckers I eat voters\nTo pay for this other doesn't cost people already have a lot of money anything then you can try to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you Jeff in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left is always like bullies and they'll do anything and they never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so\nYou know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that you know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself for like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics where there's no reason to stop and say no fully as ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth maybe\nWas a standalone grams Senate it was great it was impassioned and that was the end of it it was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican\nAnd saw grams impassioned allegation of the Democrats was followed by agreement\nWith Jeff Flake [noise]\nTo me that the FBI be allowed to do one way to get there by mellow fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country once you're really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis but it never does\nWe've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated we shared it with your way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just has to be honest and he was\n\nLindsey Graham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the when did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I carried away with about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care when they got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys ever know they said they didn't Lincoln Mr German we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate some of these other things that needs to be following up on\nTheir needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired of because all they are for birds don't weigh\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible enters the mile\n... why is that so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in pain so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility an attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production [noise]\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out capital that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held a pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again then the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom fifteenth up Republican voters are going to get kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and I hate seeing what's happening in the capital or they don't want to imagine that happening there on Kim they're going to show up in droves well I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting if Brett\nKavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is\nNot confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be there\nAre you going to be so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens at that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened and Kevin off where are the majority that we couldn't get a good time you need to come out in my garage how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans to come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in everybody thinks\nThat what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man their soul man out there were guaranteed to get their votes regular there's got to be a Republican away because of what happened to Canada and then a Republican start campaigning\n\nAnd they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe majority we know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all of us Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side of going to be so ticked off in Seoul man they're gonna show up and vote like they've never voted before\n[noise] but if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting\nMostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump Trump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone\nWill be able to turn that Kavanaugh defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and the house I don't know how they do it\n[noise] ... for us Kavanaugh was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen\nTo the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout when you have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here and sort of rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see house don't say really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin also cannot doesn't make it doesn't go to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me it ought to be the other way around\n\nAnother trick I think it's played on Republicans your base is going to be really fire enough Kavanaugh doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell Russia [noise] voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what the guy got railroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and when we're supposed to say well okay man we're really\nLoaded now that's going to really caused the turn up the ... I'm not\nSorry folks that I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is that voters are going to be out there saying even what we both Republicans and Democrats still run them down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up people elected re it's got to be the other way that the way it is we have got to be the Democrats not one of them and by the way\nIt's got to be the other way that the way that we have got to be the Democrats not look to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analysts and they all well not all but I mean a whole bunch of them\nHave this theory\nThat the way they get the base all fired up we want to let them destroy a great life great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win the midterms how does that work\n\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder or is it when they win if you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team\n\nWhy do we have to keep losing the fire up our base you're talking about a trap\n\nThis season Raj stronger with ... runs the treatment products to learn more solar honestly as dot com slash rise ready performance made very important use a proper BP when handling treated so you know\nDied on a Monday edition of KFC alive and local light after Russia at two very Wilber of the centennial Institute will be a long to talk about the Supreme Court confirmation hearings\nGeorgia van gundy the Iowa business council will share information about their members optimism for the rest of this year and chaotic seals jam Harwood will be here to talk about his brand new book about the NBA in Waterloo\nAfter Russia to [noise] the voice of eastern Iowa\nUsed ...
