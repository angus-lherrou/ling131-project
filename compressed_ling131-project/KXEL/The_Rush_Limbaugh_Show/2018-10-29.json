oh the your parents are paying you to be here I sell\nIt was kind of rude I mean here you are your do you look sixteen or do you look a little older than that\nFor Fifteen I don't I don't know I mean I look like a teenager\nOK southern vitamin C a teenager there and they still feel the need to insult you mildly world but I'm sure there was no you couldn't possibly have a mind of your own if you were doing what you were doing\nYes and I'm sure she wanted to say you're brainwashed but she probably didn't have the guts to say that\nWhile I'm curious about something I'm very flattered uh I'm vibe to no end I flattered year but that you would want to be something super and accepted all having listen to this program why journalism\n[noise] ah well I like journalism and I want to uh ... maybe one day have my own organization for military families who have had servicemen killed in action by journalism because [noise] I just I Want to\nGet my voice out there and change because I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that\nBut what about if someone gets in office after hands and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister and I just want to be one of those who gets up there and said\nI'm done with this I Want to change it for\nGood for you um there are a lot of people a lot of parents\nI'm done with that I Want to change it\nFor good for you um there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger who are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case for my whole life I have heard people say\nThroughout my life but they don't want to have kids who would dare wanna bring cans into this world that some\nI remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really\nReally knew that I Am sensing today when people say there's a people who have kids not so much do that are thinking about people who have kids are really really worried about their futures\nBecause of the way the left\nHas become more radical and more anti the general concept of America it's scaring people what kind the country are their kids\nGoing to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American but was just going to be are they going to be free are they gonna have to conform to some of this extreme wacko leftist them in order to not be hassled build up their lives there's some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that\nMore power to you and journalism needs people like you limit\nAnd I don't think that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America\nWhere there's just a bunch of people don't even belong in this country hurting and fitness and going around trying to do bad stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to hot with for a\nCountry where veterans are behind legal I mean I just I that's the one that makes me so angry as they\nDo you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as men lavish on of the people you referred to as illegals coming here who are not citizens but yet being uh granted access to so many things in given so much why do you think is happening [noise]\nAh well there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama and made it all gets come our way and you know on but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's gonna stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop it if\nI don't know I understand why America why do you think\nThere is so much for a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wanting them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting him\nWhy do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal\nWhile aspect of this I don't for a lot of people who are voting they don't know anything\nAbout why [noise] I don't know where he thought why would they ah\nI don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money then five I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken\nWell you know on their ... their people to they can't just give away money to the illegal cutting and they're like well ... they may bring jobs here\nOur they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work at ... ... agriculture or something because I Know there's a lot of illegals outlet in California and there's a lot around where I left but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people who wants to marry for cheap labor cheap labor is to answer\nThe other side of it are you you're talking about the people that don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn well making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving there's what the answer\nThe answer to the question is\nBecause the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in their human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they\nWant to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters it's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life it's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating let me put it on his way to\nRegulate the Democratic party and do not doubt me on this and you and your do your research or journalism career you will find that this is the case the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economics off alive because they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education does our crime democratic voters\nAnd those are the exact kinds of people to Democrats want to build a majority around because they won't be for ever grateful I eat dependent on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on a documented Democrats it's not that they're undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them\nGive them health care may vary track here make their trip pure worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for now some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and I'm going to run and rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite competent\nBut those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I get really hideous I guess I guess I guess really hideous think of Democrats what people need people\nWho are\nIncapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it if the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nThey don't have much faith in them anyway but they are great voters great dependent voters and thereby eyes so
