somewhere that I've never heard of did a video impersonation of Dr Ford and it was so spot on it it wasn't exactly\nUh what what I noticed her speech pattern those of us whose profession involved with the boys\nKnow very well uh the various vocal techniques that professional vocalizing views\nAnd she used to a great effect what is called up talking or up speaking and that means the end every
