the federal government's single biggest revenue source\nIn fiscal year two thousand Eighteen which ended September thirtieth the individual income tax is expected to bring in one point seven trillion dollars that is about half of all federal federal revenues and that's according to the congressional budget office\nThere's nothing I mean this is the United states of America we do not do the kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more honest here\nThat the Democrats on the left of engage them and Trump does not backed down from it and even as I say ... the magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next\nShe says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think is probably a difference but I don't know that this man made I Will say this um\nI don't want to give the trees and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can count in Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just fine in the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that were to happen with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you don't want to and then you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice falling into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I read it and the Heritage Foundation or action to report that this was during the bottom of our earth first a natural forest station controversy and it was all part of a global warming craze\nIn the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage 'cause there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... at our founding\nThe left when they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we had shot down trees and we had and replace them and make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I\nPointed out you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for ... this is the wood industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree to cut down for new ones are planted it's part of the policy a warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two than it was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them 'cause they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and chopped down a bunch of trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever then that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want your cutting down the redwoods never come back you know\nI'm the same token I remember saying it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees forested acres in America today than there were even fifty years ago\nThe second one was when when I um when I pointed out that are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green them is going to raise sea level rise and it's like ice in a glass melting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes being jumped into the ocean and not going to race but\nYou're crazy crazy if you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise ...\nNo it doesn't get a glass eyes\nAnd pour some water in it filled up still not glass in ice put as much ice in there as you can and filling up with water the ice is going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow it well not the volume is the volume a bunch of ice chunks\nFalling off a glacier are in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about they thought you know what you're talking you're not a scientist you can say that\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing and if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland out and have the ice formally what would you do to make that happen I think about what\nWould you do what she was always at work but he I have\nNever closes Fifteen hours a week here what is

I was not familiar with the case or anything like\nThat um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the the\n... what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over [noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but let's say this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed and one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics can but even more than that\nWhat was that the why am I what what was the barbarian eight of what happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no and God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born then he would kill\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by snooping there spinal cords scissors now I didn't say this on friday I didn't say this\nOn friday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frightened people away\nIt's not\nAs you I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial and I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director lets the story tell itself there aren't any\nExaggerating computer generated graphics there's there's not a lot of\nA special effect\nA real or computer generated in order to shock because this story tells itself\nThe numbers of children born alive killed by this man is stunning shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less money has done they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie main precisely because of what yet revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking it rolled people like Nick Searcy who um is a A N across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take a [noise]\nWhatever you want he travels to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling ... and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf ... pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one but they wouldn't allow any\nAs Facebook would not allow any kind of a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a lot of let's say amazing miraculous buddy if it was it was a lot of hard work and a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for them but how how difficult is it\nTo focus on the fact that this is Marsha ... did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of of abortions in the ... but the numbers are born alive this man murdered\nIt's just stunning everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion and it's called an abortion if\nYou if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is but in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was ... rock Obama who refused to support it\nLeft will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called an abortion and\nThe the the the the the thing that left just tried to do in countering this movie is to say well well if you want more God's know then you go and overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say God's now was doing\nWhat he was doing because women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to give\nThat up flat out why by the way ... clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilized people that were getting sick and infected with it just it was a pig stops in Philadelphia\nBut I did was focused on that on purpose because I didn't want the I don't want to see that because you don't\nSee it that's my point they don't graphically\nTried to make her point they focus on a murder trial but good going out there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating a
