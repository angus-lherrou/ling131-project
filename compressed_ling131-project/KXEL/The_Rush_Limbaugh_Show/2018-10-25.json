talking last night and we came up with some really good common sense points you make that kind of illustrate why we think these packages weren't actually nails\nUm it used their comments just questions and the first one to me is how likely is it male multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd have them show up miraculously at the same time and across the valley yeah and the thing that actually the vaccine that that's not that's not common sense I mean I still see how that\nCould just say that the the Niro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the day before truth CNN got there's Clinton and so forth I\nThere is still the whole group of us in that they have like four or five of them shows up all of that same thought\nWell how do you know it wasn't priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller issue when I was going to one of the Congress ... there wasn't enough postage on at the post office he even accept it\nUm the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages so you're not taking and can't pay for them you know having a ...\nI'm your he'd have to stick the post office box Wright houses boxes don't even have enough ... wind whipping oversized ...\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that that some of them actually did show up at the residents so you're going to think\nHe got invitations to go to MIT and uh and the other schools and really the the the device he put together was was not my memory is it was not advanced of all it was a it was almost the exact opposite it was almost so basic\nThat everybody was scratching their heads wondering what was so remarkable about it a Steve I appreciate what as I say I dig it out but I have a chance to Jerry in Springfield, Massachusetts store Nextel officer\n[noise] Iraq sharia I'm good\nGood good I just wanted to you know on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government it so but you also get more than any other nation and the point is that\nI have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right hell my neighbor who they should give it to see what the government do it they're telling on who they are going to\nBasically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give a choice and that's my point [noise]\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration is reacting to the soundbite we play the John Case there was a ringing his hands in guilt\nOver the fact the caravan is coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it and it because we're not in it but could be an except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls 'cause God doesn't want that\nAnd we've got to realize that that were just plain luck it's kinda like written Richard Gephardt the winners of lights lottery you know we were just minding our own business\nOne day and we got conceived in a moment in America and we've got more into America and and man that's that's so much luck that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special or so the fact that we weren't conceived in warms down in Nicaragua\nAnd that's that's so much like that that we shouldn't feel anything special about so the fact that we weren't conceived and warms down in Nicaragua Guatemala\nMeans that we all we really do and we gotta we gotta learn to walk in the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it we nobody has any trouble imagining what it's like to be poor that's why so many people strive not to be governor it isn't hard to imagine\nWe don't have a lot of people in fact uh most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income\nOr people that are in a lot of money and lose it all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never they've never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I get in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nUh statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the way to look at these disparities is not simply say oh oh that could be me and in the run around and feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining\nWell you know if there's one accident and I could have been in that era man\nAnd then having that impact\nThe way you deal with if that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism it never solves anything\nLiberalism as a\n... choice because you never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAnd all you have to do is tell people how much pain you are seeing and how it makes you so one comfortable to someone here look at the suffering and the starvation at ... and you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything all\nYou've done to say that you recognize and you're telling everybody else they've got to do something about it\nAnd that's liberalism solutions are\nWhere the answer is and solutions to these problems are exactly why they have been happening in the United states the past two years\nSolutions\nBy the
