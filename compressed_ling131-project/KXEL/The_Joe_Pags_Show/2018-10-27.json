I got to leave your thinking missed opportunities today to uh to score points it just didn't happen for for whatever reason\nAbsolutely it was ... we just turn the game over and literally what the turnovers and the and the you know though\nYou know when you're from uh football's a when you're blowing opportunities right for half time I mean we should've scored in the first Dr\nWeaver missed the kick should Joe scored on the last drive right for halftime and throwing intercept should should've scored in the first drive the second half I'm as you go right down the list and that's only a few so a lot of missed opportunity\nAnd throwing intercept should've should've scored in the first drive a second half I mean you go right down the list and that's the only a few so a lot of missed opportunity is what you'll you'll take from this game\nUh what else about it off ... is is frustrating for you when you see are the chances you had that just didn't work out\nToday well we'll go back and review them before I make comments on it 'cause it was frustrating Sarah offense perform like that and had great feel position\nYou know I'm sure he came out maybe missed the first one but they're not to get the second one because we were in position to get the second one too after the fumble of on the thirty hard line so when you when you don't you don't learn from the first few phases out there and you make the same air again and then you just want to go back and see what actually happened before you\nMake a critical choice out there of you know decide what happened so I can only see what I saw in the sideline and\nThe frustration part is we were there you should have learned the first time to make a similar air the second time how did how did that happen unless my and make sure that doesn't happen again\nIt seemed like you move the football well between the twenties too with the running game was there at times and and he like did you know complete twenty two passes a but it was just it was in those scoring opportunities that it just got away from you take it to the end of the first half as we were a\nBit confused on the the partially blocked ... were you recovered if they're Thirteen but they called the sideline deal with a a contact or you were frustrated with that call we could tell\nThat that what happened on that one is like you said the balls on the Thirteen yard line\nThe ball started on the one yard line if I remember when the play started correct so the balls and the one yard line the play ended up the only be Thirteen yard line and they called the official called the coach for being on the sideline half were blocked it for celebrating for the ... the personal fall\nWho was at the I think our box ends at the thirty hard line so we're twenty yards away and I don't understand so I Can't make that comment here till I see it but that's where it was for\n... and ... and as you mentioned a big change because now you're trying to go in from the twenty eight instead of the Thirteen with forty some seconds left would trailed sixteen to ten at halftime or you know you had a lot of time in that second half you got the football to start they have what what was the the mood like the discussion like at halftime of this one today\nIt was much like this saying listen you're sixteen uh ten and you've played a terrible half\nI mean we've had opportunities time and time again and made the air's not getting the end zone when you're sixteen to town and you get the ball first and second half one drive in your head and we came out drove the feeling we should have been hit so there was much like this was like\nDon't worry about being frustrated don't there's no pressure here just\nTo perform now glum form for half because even though you may not have been successful in the first half like you would have been you know you're only six points down even playing the way we did you know I think there's two turnovers to enter ... and ... you know stupid stuff like that and yet you're sixteen to attend\nA at the half so that was the conversations like doesn't matter what the coaches draw are there is no adjustments nothing happened it was you just got to perform and finished your eyes and and it's about execution and and make 'em blend\nYour thoughts on the defensive effort today I looked like he did a good job against the running game Shane only gets forty four yards for them to get a hundred for the game on thirty five carries looked like you you made him a bit one dimensional ... what did what did\nYou sense what I sense is we're good on defense tell about midway through the third quarter they got the two big place in the first half got the stutter go max protecting and that was that the trick play soon as they got that when I was in that Wendy but they did get the breeze\nAnd they went after it and we had we we are our coverage wasn't good but actually we are in position we just didn't finish the play so they made a big play there and then I Can't there was another big play in that first you have to us it was too big place that should and shouldn't have\nKind of explosive plays it that's what you can't give up type deal so otherwise that was the only place in the first half and even a third quarter they didn't have anything 'cause we we we all were spot in the ball to fifty yard line at the forty five yard line starting our officers have dry eyes\nThe first few series is so and then we then we start to leak at the end and then we that's what I didn't like about it was\nWe didn't finish strong because then we started leaking like we did against North Dakota state you know once they got by you know two and a half possessions\nWe noticed there you know their punter how Shorty was it that play into it it looks like you had some kind of a plan to to get after that point and actually has to be rewarding when you actually do get one of the yeah it was\nActually well well designed well scammed in well well played you know but it was it was ... negated\nBy stupidity has bodies you can say it and and you don't want to be mad about it was because the guy celebrating now and the guy celebrating and our sideline on the white on our side line at the forty hour living to play is way down by the end zone and you're going\nReally but also you can say whatever you want to say about it was just an unfortunate thing that happened and it cost us a touchdown right there with I Would have been Seventeen sixteen going to have much like the south Dakota\nSo there's a lot of momentum momentum chances in this game where we could have caught fire and we did score and the first Dr score and the last drives going first during the second half\nAnd when you don't do that you'll have team like this hang around they get better and better and better and they get mail momentum is everything yeah it\nIt feels like a game or of all the games you play so far this year you love more points on the field today than than than any other game this year\nThan all game started together feels like it that he didn't feel like it it was we did you know and that's that's what the ... you know the things that we have to understand his players and coaches of of why that happened instead of just that happened to us and there's no says get mad about it as a gift smart about it and\nGo ... of a part of the game none of us likes\nAh unfortunately it looked like the last ... last played I often I don't know if you saw that I I didn't I thought was an unnecessary shot but whatever I mean nothing was called so go from there that I mean that have any effect in a Second Avenue ... one of your you know return guys he's a good cover guy\nNow we're set to go down and work from under center I feel missing the boat back\nMark as why the tail back out of the one receivers but why left in Boston they give it to mark is trying to get off the ... ads nice to have farms are mainly going to get into the end zone for the touchdown touchdown you and I guess why Miller one yard touchdown run for why Miller\nHis fourth rushing touched down of the season that\nComes with one fifty two left to play in the football game earth a mad at the extra point it was thirty seven seven teen\nAfter the panther touchdown western Illinois up by twenty the Panthers did not onsite kick it they just kick the deep into the end

I didn't\nWatch what I heard most of it on the radio here but\nYeah I didn't care uh assumption you know that there's no urgency come out flat or whatever I don't know you know sometimes you wonder if a missed field or a scoring opportunities like that has an effect later wrong you know down the line\nEven though it was you know they weren't write that down the field and they were there again right oh I don't know\nBut\nI don't know I mean looking forward and uh the Illinois state lost today western Illinois look like they could run the table now\n[noise] um\nI think that game next week with the Illinois state is actually going to be\nA factor playoff game absolutely but I'm a loser probably looking at six in the five best winter seven and before with a five and three or six and to record in conference which will get you on the playoffs you up\nAnd you know everyone always stayed happens to go six in the five that's the death knell for them because one of their when the sub division one opponent so wow you want to talk about what you're back against the law to better come out swinging now\nThey have to and I and I think this this team and again I think that's what sometimes it's so frustrating about panther football they seem to do this a lot\nOh yeah I mean they'll come out bill come out and guns blazing me they destroyed South Dakota state I mean just it was a buck kicking\nOr out and then all that sort of like a lawyer it yeah and then All right we got this playoffs looking doing everything as well and then you throw a clunker and they're like this one now yeah again like exactly what your back is up against that now the good the good news is\nI'm looking at the the standings right now this does not hurt us because they want to state lost\nUm now South Dakota state did win but we hold the uh the edge over them so it's still I think once it comes out should still be sitting second in the valley\nIowa work yeah we're going to be taught will be tied for second\nRight but broke with western Illinois so yeah\nRight as far as well yeah but we lost a western Illinois right so you know we are behind them more ahead of I don't know for a western insulted no it was true in South Dakota state pump play each other this yourself around\nHer and it's just a nice big mess that the same kind of put themselves and and I think oh if you listen to a far earlier conversation with why after the game I think he was\nVery poignant when he was talking about you know it's halftime speech you know and you know it was very relaxed and you know look we just played about as bad a half of football's we can't or won't went down sex you know we clean this up we wouldn't have game problem is they never clean it up\nSo exactly and they had an again you're only down by six going into the have I mean they had that and they got the ball back again or I finally said you march down the field you're up by a point\nAt the end of the fourth punch safety punt pick fumble pick pond turnover on down those were the drives that we had\nJust not efficient and five oh fourteen on third down conversions\nWestern Illinois nine of fourteen\nAnd that was the other thing I think the ... the defense just couldn't get off the field and you're converting nine and fourteen on third downs you're gonna have problems\nBut again we we didn't have any penalties and the second that was good\nBut was it just me or was there an insane amount of reviews it bumps watch them as they every place seemed to be reviewed I bake\nA call at what you will call it travel issues or whatever it the games slowed down and I don't know that played into western Illinois favor or the United states but that game probably took an extra hour then it showed up and I got I don't know if I don't I don't know if that helps the homes even the president saying\nWell let's go with it helped the home team and their situation um came just it I I don't understand we need reviews we you know you need to get the calls right and that's fine but some of the calls it was like really\nYour your review on that it was I mean I saw it and I don't see very well\nAnyway just my thoughts\nThree one nine to five Fifteen forty the number to call or eight hundred five eight four seven zero to four panther brands what are you thinking what are you feeling what uh what's going on it's like I said\nSomeone's got an answer I Would love to hear from you we have to take a quick break or back with more of the home of the Panthers dot com post game called Joe here in just a bit on news talk Fifteen forty KFC out\nThere is more of the home of the Panthers dot com post game show coming up exclusively on news talk Fifteen forty ... yeah\n[noise]\n...

standings um especially with the Illinois state losing that was a big help thank you South Dakota state for that because we beat South Dakota state now we are tied currently with western Illinois\nAnd of course no one in the on the planet is going to catch North Dakota state\nSo again we're tied for second them in the Missouri Valley we can still accomplish some of the things that this team wants to get done um\nBut now they're now they're ... really up against that now the Illinois state game while I was already going to be a big game it was that was already a very important game both for today we talked about last week that you know that was kind of a key to the hall they they can take out western or I'm Sorry Illinois state um\nIt really opened up a lot of things but now this team is up against the wall and I mean literally this is it it's their beepers right this was a playoff game it's kind of a winner go home and\nIt couldn't have western Illinois continues to play well I'm\nSouth Dakota states working around Illinois to I mean you've got some good teams in the valley and\nYou've got to take care of business so we've had this happen before they had happened last week happy and Marion remember Cathy's calling from last week calling out panther an Asian we got a packed into next week I'm not kidding and coach ... said it a million times panther fans are worth more

state take care of business at Illinois state uh thirty eight twenty eight by the way I have a a shout out to Scott Peterson who I think had the quote of the day\nSo they're doing the ... the post game show and Gary said uh you know talking about Illinois state losing to South Dakota state Illinois states going to come into the unit dominant ... next week Scott and Scott said I'm going to come into the you know do a pretty foul McGarry was a fantastic quote and I agree and\nI Hope that you and I deem the Panthers are going to come into the you to do with a pretty lousy mood as well and they should at I'm gonna take a wild guess that coach Farley is going to have that team working pretty hard next week I'm going to guess they're all going to be in a pretty lousy mood\nAnd so that's going to that really is going to be an interesting game with the Illinois state both teams are in need of a wait and you and I have to have the wet a couple of the scores Indiana State uh defeats Youngstown
