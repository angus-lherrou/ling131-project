their hands full this afternoon very highly ranked team is similar to what North Dakota state brought in a couple of weeks ago so hopefully the outcome will turn out a little better here on their own government\nBoth teams coming off the impressive wins from a week ago South Dakota state was the winner at\nHome over Youngstown State thirty six this loving to improve their conference record to win one and the men boring one overall whether you want to pay if there's one big road game at twenty\nFourth rank South Dakota last Saturday forty two twenty eight the Panthers also sent to win one in the Missouri Valley football ... three and three overall\nWas right and I are on the last times I go to state came ... they didn't get a chance to complete the game is supposed to believe in cycles and that one as you remember that was a bunch of lightning and stuff going on I never did get that\nGame insults that record might be a little different if they'd have to play with ... and we're going to like I don't know I mean that's a good football team no question about it but interesting that the the weather is not going to be a factor today but it certainly would be if we were outside\nSpeaking of something that's interesting I was talking with Tyler marry him he's the play by play voice and you'll hear more from him on the other my portion of our pre game show we're talking about coach barley implementing a three three defense last\nWeek to help this Panthers football team defeat South Dakota and he says you know we're kind of wondering what defense coach Farley will break out today against their great on fence and tearing Christian except for one thing they sought help them as in preparing\nFor the Iowa State game in their season opener I was they felt was going to run some three three so they think they're prepared for the defense you and I ran a week ago\nUs right South Dakota didn't have the luxury of looking at it on tape ... go to state had that on tape and I'm sure they started it very closely it out before the game I was talking to coordinate or Jeremiah Johnson had a lot to do that for money and all that it does a great job in that capacity for the Panthers he says we got to do new things today too\nAnd also unfortunately a couple of new players will talk about that at the game goes along\nHow about this year's match up between these two teams I coach barley the paint their head coach who you'll hear on our pre game show coming up also talked a lot this week about the great quarterback that South Dakota state has in senior tearing Christians he is re written their record book a at\nThat quarterback spot for the Jack rabbits also he's got his name plastered all over the valley rector book and even the app cs record book [noise] is that the big challenge today trying to corral that guy\nThat'll be part of it yeah so that that fortunately they lost two receivers to the NFL that you've got to start playing a lot ... why do you think\nIs on a on a on a practice squad I don't know that he's actually made it onto an active roster but a a heck of a receiver but they have a couple of good ones coming back Lou Gehrig I don't think they've got a Dallas ... then all those guys that go on that started in ... there are a precious commodity you don't see guys like that very often\nWe watch for four years of it we know he was a\nGood Christian doesn't add those guys throw to so he has a little more weight on his shoulders I think a running this off message and the top that off their leading Rauscher coming into the afterlife because her last week I was like well is he won't be able to play now I Know there are other to tell facts are pretty good and that freshman they got the CJ Wilson are really high on him and\nReally talented button ... different running then Isaac Wallace was so\nWe'll have to see what that does to South Dakota states off it's also but you don't want dirt Christian running around on there and we don't know it's almost like you want to keep them in the pocket he's he's so dangerous when it gets outside there and if he gets loose he's got to speed to run away from people\nIt sees a rare commodity in a quarterback good are good runner savvy leader but he's been good he's really good\nBut we seem to be bad a couple of times through so let's hope that's one of those after news for the bad the threat\nIs speaking of Isaac Wallace who was the senior starting running back for the Jack rabbits he was averaging nine ... yards a care\nThat's unbelievable it out you know they had one game theory that kind of skewed ... staff so they would they put ...\nSomebody you know it was it was a mismatch obviously it's all that skews a little bit of their off it just asked but we know Turkish and we watched him he came in here as a freshman dairy and and won a game and the you don't think that was four years ago now\nHe's a talented individual this a good program coach there ... runs up there in South Dakota state has some big buyers from you and I ... and here's a graduate\nHe's a talented individual that's a good program coach their goal Meyer runs up there in South Dakota state we had some ... some you and I ties here's a graduate assistant here very Terry Allen ... together a same age said you know type of thing he didn't go to you and I became very right after\nHe got done with his his college days that so he has been around you and I program a little bit too so that's another interesting little factor\nYet coach ... coach just two hundred and fifty a college game last\nWeek when they beat Youngstown State thirty six seven he's got a hundred and fifty two wins as a college football coach Ninety eight losses good winning percentage for coach Diego veteran college football coach a and also a veteran coach here in the Missouri valid football conference along with the guy\nThat has one more Missouri valid football conference\nGames than than any other college football coach in the Panthers mark far with\nA good match up there and it's ... glass guide Gary ... he's done a lot you know they invested a lot in their program up there they got the new stadium out a nice new facilities they they put a lot of money into their program and he's been making a payoff they've been what last six years I think they've been in the in the playoffs right now one of the one of the few teams that there's been able to do that\nWhen you talk rankings we mentioned that South Dakota state has ranked number two in the nation and the un I Panthers are twenty fifth in the ... the Panthers have played the toughest yet Jill in MCS what bullet courting the Massey\nRatings how 'bout that rank burst with the western Illinois Ilan South Dakota and Wieber state rounding out the top five as far as top the schedules today and it doesn't get any easier today when you're taking out of the number two team and then a\nCharge right but you know we talked about it so important in the valley play especially you have to when you're home if you're if you're ... through ... finish in that top two or three you know and and it's already been one last opportunity to North Dakota state governor\nNow the parents have a chance with another highly ranked team a very good football team but by golly it's all coming today goats barley loves those guys play well a lot of the former players come back you know they come back to one game a lot of times it's own family he wants them to play well today I think there will whether that's enough to get a victory that remains to be saying\nAll right stay with us a lot more to get you on a ... game show here today from the ... the un I hosting South Dakota state will jak the high be scoreboard and also take a look at the match ups around the Missouri Valley football conference\nOn another day where all ... teams in the valley are facing a fellow league opponent ... we'll get to that we'll get to the other Mike Scott Peterson scouting report on the Jack rabbits our talk with you and I had football coach large barley and starting lineup so all yet to comment on our\nAlso has a deal on mobile one full synthetic motor oil unified court judge friendly twenty nine Ninety nine ... help for people to nap and know how to know [noise]\n\nThis is the Panthers sports radio network [noise]\nPlaying host to the number two ranked team in the country the south Dakota state Jack rabbits and another huge Missouri Valley football conference game here this afternoon for your Panthers it's time to talk with\nThe other Mike the other might is Tyler marry him he's the play by play voice of the Jack rabbits radio network in Maine you guys are just having another outstanding\nCeased rather play well so far four and a lot and of course the low loss a four point game up in Fargo to ... North Dakota state you and I both had a chance to to see them up front to I'm close to the person so we know what it's all about but it's been an excellent here so far this is a real top two weeks stretch though for the tax here against are ranked team next week at\nIllinois state another great team was a big game today so this is a two weeks that we're going to find out a lot more about to John Stewart Myers jak\nRats take us back to the start of the season and where you sit now and what it looks like moving forward how much do you think not playing that game at Iowa State has affected this team or could affect it when you get down to the end of the regular season I think\nIf anything it could become a bit of a positive because let's face it last year the jacks didn't play an F. B. S. team they played a couple of lower level left the U.S teams the win that's all people looked at the end of the year because of the strength of the valley they didn't say well they didn't play in a B C and they said look they're nine and two and so without that\nPotential loss certainly if you get a win it's a different story but if you assume most of the time you lose that game hip you go along in that vein not having that loss on the slate could make a world of difference let's say the jak has one more game the rest of the ...\nSo most of the time you lose that game tape you go along in that vein not having that loss on the slate could make a world of difference let's say the jak has one more game the rest of the year they're sitting at aged to you have\nTo figure that's good enough to be a top aide to see eight three might be but eight and two looks a lot better we thought it might affect dusty su more in the non conference didn't\nJak certainly played more than a while when they went up to Fargo and just launched close game to number one so I think to this point it hasn't been as much of a hindrance as we thought it may be wondering originally\nA curse your senior quarterback tearing Christians not only ... writing the Jack rabbits record book but the up cs ... books he's a special kids he's a special\nKid he's the type of guy Gary that in high school we all knew that just made him mad because he was good at everything he dead you know he he just picked up golf a couple of years ago is already got a hole in one night he says that type of kids are very smart great leader can run the football can throw the football and he's had to do things differently this year because he hasn't\nHad okay I Know I've got ... I Know I have one of the key to NFL capable talents because you don't have those guys have had more on his shoulders and he's handled things very well [noise]\nYou lose your uh starting running back Isaac wall let's talk about the running game without him [noise]\nShould know Wallace obviously started but might eat in you'll saw a lot of wraps they basically put to those two\nAnd then CJ Wilson would see some significant carries had occasionally appear strong junior so they were using for guys but certainly Wallace was an atheist Wallace had the game winning touchdown run it over time against Indiana State had a big run in Fargo a Wallace suffered a significant hip injury and he's done for his career and he always hate to see that\nSlip jak so after ... work some things that running back up because he was one of those big play threats Daniels more of a a bulldozer type ... junior CJ Wilson are guys that will have\nTo carry the load as far as those cutback runs and adding the speed to us because Wallace brought an excellent dynamic and he was a senior and you know how big that is scary guys who have been in these situations before he knew the atmosphere here most of the strong denies\nYou mention God or end when a key were a couple of eating targets for quarterback German Christian a year ago they're gone but it looks like he got another dynamic duo in that receiving corps\nIt's worked out well ... Johnson it a couple of the big games early in the year a sophomore who the ... tried to get involved in certain situations a year ago it was an excellent kick return or the taking them off of that for the most part to focus on op eds as\nOf late Adam Anderson a kid from Orlando who had a good year two years ago broke his leg late in the year never got on track last year coming off that injury he's had some big games lately they really like those two they use the facts\nIn the past game and you'll see a little bit of the tight end game ... makes them catches but\nAgain it's not going to replace Dallas got her so hard to make a catch now and again so we'll cool it's but it's not the same on fence as far as the it'll a seizure the tight end of the way it was the last few years what do you look like defensively and it looks like a couple of former Iowa high school football players are key components\nOf that jak grabbing the thrills of Bowman back\nIn the middle of plate so while at linebacker that you actually the linebacker\nPosition is their strength or deep their horse play really well as a unit the front for is probably as good as the Jackson had\nIn this stretch of playoff rounds of started back in twenty twelve the interior of the line as a red shirt freshman and sophomore rocket Kerlikowske an ex navy or war but they ever really done a good job NDSU abandoned the interior run game and the second half\nYoungstown State and tried to run outside they didn't want anything to do with running between the tackles that's the impact\nThat the interior that jak rabbit line has had that's one thing I'm interested to see today because we know you and I want to be a power running team\nAnd so it's going to be the er the irreversible forcing the immovable object you know that type of thing to to see how these two are units go at it that she will be a fun\nFun thing to watch this afternoon if it comes down to a big kick special teams you got some kid named vinegar Terry still kicking for yes we do chased by the terrorists got another year left after this to Garret he has been a little ... and so last week and probably this week again not very long gone out with a man and Terry ...\nDo the place kicks last week missed a couple of extra points to make is only\nA field goal try so it was perfect in that aspect but\nAs far as military goes if he's healthy he is a a special special individual are capable of going from over fifty yards and he just sort of have ice water in the veins which like you said I think that comes from his uncle Adam\nBefore we let you go Tyler ... main keys to get outta here with a win over twenty fifth rank you when\nI told you the other day when I was oh PR I think it's the same thing turnovers and obviously you and I took such advantage of the turnovers when it was that big match up in Vermillion last week the jacks can ill afford to turn the ball over they've only turned it over twice this year one of those was in the end zone at North Dakota state and\nWe all you you don't turn that over maybe going to touch down there maybe win that game so turnovers I think will be huge the other thing like we alluded to lose more physical who's going to pop in the mouth today\nYou and I from the very first play ... in Vermillion last Saturday that was obvious watching the film average accident I'm pretty good job of that this year even one team shows up\nMore physical again when those those guys pound in the middle when you when I was trying to run the football whoever wins that battle goes a long way to win this football game I think we're in for a great game into teams blend contest a year ago that you guys probably one of the more important one when you want in that\nPlayoff game we spoiled you're homecoming I Know you guys are coming in here today trying to return that favor well into I tell you one it's interesting because take away the playoff game that lasts for regular season games the real team as one\nAnd we both think we've got pretty good home field advantage is so I guess we just throughout the records let's face it these are two really good Missouri Valley football conference programs\nLike you said or maybe the scores in the end end up a little lopsided now and again but this should be a lot of fun just All right great to see a great inside have a great call and best of luck the rest of the way you Gary thank you Tyler marry him he's the other might\nHe's the excellent play by play voice of the south Dakota state Jack rabbits radio network our coach in the boom will give you a his scouting report\nOn the Jack rabbits that scout South Dakota state\nWhen we come back right after the ... as you want to paint their football driven by board from Libya\n\nMany dealerships promise customer service and a comfortable buying ... what does that really may ... and we know they're providing unmatched service and\nPutting you it is during the buying process isn't just something that

bored right on my way through your chair rocks that destination for store\nFor you don't really like you're treated\n[noise] are\nYou in a bookstore is your one stop shop for textbooks here deer

governor ... deal for you by one for the regular menu price and get your second for a price determined by the you and I feel are football the breeze Yardley you and I even allows who Saturday games on Monday\nYou may one then for your second week though if you and I use that one hundred eighty four yours is your second ... only one dollar in eighty floors than it used to work out a little ...\nTried to think of like to play the head of the gay if this goes wrong where where I go to what how do I just and how do we fix it because he got split second stuff on game day and that was probably the most stressful thing but it worked the way it was supposed to play or just a tremendous job and execution and or were you really look good run into the football in the defense\nInstead of using that for three look you went to the three three how much do you implement that today you carry that over to the day's game\nThere there was some carry over there'll be some carry over and and\nYou know we play that well I'm\nSure you'll take it to another level if you can\nBut it up there all says do you have to have personnel and what really made a goal last week I thought Christian Jake and got his first started and I said before that a tremendous job really tackled well are you had corporate Sanders playing the safety really played well that particular day yet a jail and out there so we are playing with three safety is set up to and\nKnow that helped us a Roosevelt and leave your Williams plant corner and allow them to go down and press corner a little bit better so we can take advantage of their town a little bit more than being backed off so between they have a press corps of three safeties and allowed us to play a little bit more aggressively and and the secondary\nThe defense alliance and those three guys Russia and the way they did they wouldn't have been much of a defense and those guys really took a took the challenge which it was a challenge and they end up getting five sacks of this ring that Russia\nAnd how much as South Dakota state prepares their ... to go up against your deep and how much and showing that three three and a lot now does it make them happy to be prepared to see a number of different looks from your defense code\nThat well I tell you what it'll do figure out what we're going to do I mean that that part of it to the replay the body of a defense known to man and\nUh so you know we've been in the ... we've been on free for fun you know what that open they are as early as it was an adjustment you know young defence when we were still hadn't had to go to some growing pains but this this three three five things kind of hit the right guys at the right time\nSo we'll see what what we're like health wise because we did get knocked up last week but\nEach week kind of presents a different problem the problem this week is the quarterback to Billy Iran so\nQuarterback it just supporting this coverage of the other receivers\nCan you share with us some of the injuries that ... may hurt that deep and see the unity of yours a little bit\nWell we lost critical Arabic uh that was that was too bad is it Richard freshmen and\nHe's ... he was playing very well as you want to lead taxes our football team and he may be done for the season so that's unfortunate for him it and uh he was playing very very well it's unfortunate for us because it you know we were in that position anyway but ah ... well take on that road rules and the linebacker spot and\nPublic Thomas was the other one that was questionable as we went through the weekend or is questionable as going into this game\nIs a really good on that you're going to face today to coach it is this a really good off assets are\nSenior quarterback they lost some good players of last year 'cause it was really low and last year and but this year the quarterback is kind of picked up the slack of losing God or a couple of those running backs ahead and\nThey're tough tough offsets get ready for because they're they're so uh this direction left right down the metal a lot of guys pulling in every direction so it's a good skiing but the quarterback makes it go because\nWho are fans you know if you remember a ... a ... and you know an air Bailey how fast they weren't as compared to other guys this guy's Arab Bailey fast when he when he hits the gear he's got a gear that a lot of guys don't have so that's that's why he scores every week\nThis guy's air Bailey fast that made when he when he hits the gear he's got a gear that a lot of guys don't have so that's that's why\nHe scores every week by ground takes off and runs for Seventy are scramble touchdown and these two to three touchdowns a day or against everybody could solve a North Dakota states so they put a great numbers and he's a big reason why\nYou're on fences been really good hero late ... looking great receivers titans running backs that up and she blind or\nThe ... today what do you got to see against a Jack rabbits deep bench that is not too bad either when you look at the numbers that they put up stat why so far\nWe got to match up my main we got not only ... got a\nKnow he lies the light needs to continue as growth\nHe's fine receivers and his running backs up to you know make it work for him a protection has been goods go continue to be good I think that's been the difference in our season this year the protection upsets really the thing that stands out to be the most right now is\nA our communication they'll lie to him and the whole lives really coming together nice too tight as are playing well you know you got Braley allies really working hard for sure he lived but um you know it's going to take\nA team effort to be this court about what we're gonna have we're going to need a great team\nBanter defense went up to a special teams play for field position if we can get the total team combination team is always better than ... ...\n... and he's been a nice job starting it left guard the last two games can you get Nick Alice back\nToday we we will not uh it's unfortunate that you know he's struggling ... last year [noise] uh he's he's got the other one this year and it just doesn't come along like he wanted to solve we're going to get him back last week he actually went out the feel of South Dakota\nStarted jogging around and try to warm up you just couldn't he just couldn't do it and I feel bad for him button\nRed shirt senior first start was North Dakota state and second start with South Dakota during the tremendous job playing right guard force guys play left Charlotte right guard left ... everything but center defensive tackle the last year but\nNow he's if you're if you're happy for\nDad this kind of success he lost his dad does pass or this past year and it you know it's a big deal for him as a very close family so\nThat ... I feel so good that title is getting this success that is because this is so deserve\nA year ago when the regular season game and you beat South Dakota state at their place markets why Miller had a huge game running the football hundred and Seventy ... are\nPlays with them how important is to get ... ground game going today whether it's you know markets or ... whoever it is the dollar talking is not rush game to them to\nDo can you can you can just live\nWe have seven minutes off the third quarter clock for one drive [noise] so if you keep their quarterback off the field is going to give me a better chance to win so part of the says we need to score but also a good ground game and that\nSpecial teams are in type games great matchups in this league are always important when you look at how your special teams are performing what South Dakota state counters with what about that they use of the gang\nBig part of the game we're gonna have to you know we got cones back and he's he's now on the ball good he came back last week about Austin earth has done dirty well force so we just have to we have to score when we get the opportunity and the red zone\nRed zone then we have to change their position our with our special things where there was a return ball or whether it's a punch bowl we got to do a good job with those pages and they're very good on special teams\nGetting off do a good start doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win the game it did last year you jumped down them Seventeen to nothing in the first\nThe first game they land to nothing new members mortar and ... just when you look at this ...\nIt'll be a little shorter game but how critical as they get out of the gate with a good start to that you might think that's always credit\nThere's no worse you want to
