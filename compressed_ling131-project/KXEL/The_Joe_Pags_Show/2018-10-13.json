live stream so yeah I mean we're we're we're getting ready for a big election\nAnd the president's out during the campaign trail and he's going to take a name for a lot of Republicans that are in tight races and it's starting to look more and more like the Senate not only won't go to the Democrats but it looks like it's probably going to gain some Republicans\n\nCould be as many as three or four and then you'd have a majority of fifty four fifty five Republicans would be great to have sixty but you've got a super majority you didn't get really get some some things done that house however still up for grabs and that's interesting\nBecause um it was a an alleged blue wave not very long ago\nThe middle of a sudden something funny how and on the way to the election things started changing people started saying I'm I'm not so sure ... and here's why and if we could break it down very simply\nThe left in this country really shot itself in the foot when it comes to cabinet that's what happened they really did have momentum going\nNo reason why they have momentum were simple they were saying stuff like we used to have to be together we have to be diversion diversity is our strengths than we were built on immigrants and we we're a country that's accepting an open arms of loving and it's a big tent and there is a big meaty with\nWith uh you know the orange hair some going in the White House and it uses a mean guy who who grabs the women in the says the things and he's just a big meaty stupid face who who doesn't have the the temperament to be the president and then the twenty Fifth Amendment an impeachment is the right way to go\nAnd and they were saying these things that people were buying into\nWell yeah I Want peace and harmony own understanding diversity I Won a a a big tent where everybody's welcome and we love immigrants and so on\nThat was working and then came Kavanaugh\n... row and the left showed who really was you had Spartacus group because Booker\nYou had Dianne Feinstein they're sitting on a letter that she had that somebody alleged sexual impropriety\nYeah tunes just is outraged at all times was it was not killed his way you've got Richard Blumenthal who's a liar about his service claiming that he went to Vietnam when he never did\nYou ever got Kamala Harris who who's going to run for president when I don't know that I've ever seen somebody more negative been nasty torn up political foes you got any Columbus Charlotte who thinks they're drinking beer at six am is cool and acted like it was bad that Brett Kavanaugh had to be back in college so\nYou have the left there was interrupting that was rude that was outlandish that was out of line\nThat\nActually used as appalled lousy forward or when she she has to be anonymous and not be up there in the public lied to her or her legal team did who by the way which suggested by Feinstein lied to her about whether they would come out interviewer in California\nI mean the tires thing really showed who the left is so they can say togetherness and we want to work across the aisle like we've got this idiot Robert Francis O'Rourke running for Senate in Texas goes by bad though for some reason he calls himself ...\nHe's not as dramatic but all those bumper stickers just say be geo and all of a size just they'd be geo\nHe wants to believe that his name is Beto O'Rourke is Robert Francis or work for the fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that just don't pretend you're somebody you're not\nHe's a guy that was that a punk rock band and word dress he was arrested for for ... W why in the late nineties the guy who reported him 'cause there was an accident says he tried to flee the scene of police report says he tried to flee the scene\nPolitically\nHe said things like I'm open to the idea of abolishing eyes\nHe said things like we basically stole half of Mexico from them which is patently untrue\nHe said things like he would definitely want to impeach the president of the United states should he get in he's an open borders guy he believes in open borders doesn't want a border wall\nYet when you see those commercials or here's commercials he's saying things like or diversity is your strength and we need to be together and work together for better or Texas\nWell that crap doesn't work anymore because people in America actually watch what you people did in the capital hearings it was disgusting and you went from probably winning the Senate to you're going to lose it now\nProvided people actually go out and vote you need to go and vote\nAnd and a guaranteed when in the house doesn't look so likely anymore\nAnd the reason for that it was people understand that right now under this president of the lower taxes they've got more jobs than we've had ever\nGot black and Hispanic unemployment through the roof women unemployment ... you've got manufacturing\nWe've got more jobs than we've had ever\nGot black and Hispanic unemployment through the roof women unemployment ... you've got manufacturing coming back our standing in the world is much better for the terrorists are working because we're getting better deals with Mexico and with Canada would be you [noise]\nThings are shifting\nThe left over to the gym [noise]\nAnd that's what we're seeing now have to pretend like the president does or doesn't like us granted loves Robert ... which is just dumb when we come back to duty here from Sarah pay with former governor of Alaska right here\nOn the weekend don't touch that uh\nThis is the weekend with geo pound [noise]\n\nWe we all knew about\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't\nThat that's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that share um what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nA San Francisco right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for laughing because that court six million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh and they are only serving their five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so\nFriendly and be messing around with that uh that was that's very very dangerous and the other thing is that\nTrump you know President Trump saw the light and is allowing at our ally in decades of\nThe nation understanding what Anwar has in terms of resources to help our country become more energy independent that inherent link between energy and security energy and prosperity that at our that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere\nThat Lisa would put that in jeopardy and\nGave that to her he gave that to her to Alaskans but it was through her and for I mean that was a real nice thank you Trump ... they're trying\nIt just it just as a researcher of him and of course you know survey one I'm a I got to jump on that we are reliant on people in the middle East that don't necessarily like us why not go and get it from what some of the challenges of search to hundred years one of the world there in in war why wouldn't we going to become self reliance and turn to speak it off to these bad\nGuys and by the way we used the Murkowski voted no I Want everybody watching and listening especially those of you in the last year she voted no one cabinet officially it's in a prison vote because later she changed it for dangerous going back\nTo his daughter's wedding so she said I'm just going to vote president disorder counterbalance we would have been but she on the record in the first round should know\nLiteral am absolutely so that's that's typical political ... that's a typical politician wanting to kind of play both sides truly had a problem with Kavanaugh\nBeing on the bench and she said he's not the right man for the bench then she her boat then at the final vote what reflected that instead of say oh well I Do this because it's not really count any way that we really\nBelieve something if you have that come with pointing due north knowing what the right thing is to do then you fight for that but instead it's\nVery wishy washy and you learn you know\nIn the middle of the road who get hit on both sides\nDressing room or a villain the former vice presidential nominees will vote in party to vote was also the former governor break state of Alaska in just a great person and I love the we're having this conversation are you going to take a wrong because your tweet might have been the best we never seen\nThis entire year it was a Lisa Murkowski and gives you twenty twenty two from our house\nTalk right executive haven't\nThe only thing that keeping me from just being close to the wall enthusiastic about the idea is twenty twenty two so far away\nDoes that yeah I mean that's almost frustrating looking that far but we're still like me was always preaching to people stand up make a difference the gifted and talented opportunities God created for you and\nOh like me who's always preaching to people stand up make a difference I think the gifts and challenges and opportunities God created for you and\nYour front well you know I Can't just keep preaching it and not jumping in off the hook at some point one of the position I Would so desire serving of this country and we'll see where that goes you'll forget yeah sure what we're talking about the second amendment which\nJudge Kavanaugh is he's he's absolutely constitution their Second Amendment\nLee hesitating Leigh voted for President Obama's tax on different judicial positions including getting there on the DC circuit she pro abortion totally anti gun anti commonsense constitutional is she and leave no problem it\nCan to to um have you back to vote 'em up and down it was always up\nFor Obama's picks but wouldn't give that the ... back\nAnd I think consideration for a good man like cabinets another problem that leads to have an impact\nIs that we had many never Trump burst around her rather than have proper and um she\nHired a lot of never Trump first then has hired a lot of never Trump worse and some of these folks you know we keep warning him about he can't win them over there going to continue to undermine and that's quite unfortunate for the ... movement\nBut why did was work has given her name is just to get the votes in Alaska hoping that people won't pay attention to the record what you just go just now in the past minute we're told me I can never vote for\nYeah a ... and that is why yeah that are by the name I mean that it's the consummate right oh\nAbsolutely right it's surveilling the vice presidential nominee and also the former governor's race in Alaska or in a moment to have left I\nI Would be remiss if I didn't do back to you and your family were created by the media when you were announced it and I imagine I ... in my life that were really great I was told my family I succeeded in doing something I could imagine when you're told John McCain want you to be the vice presidential nominee almost like recovered are being told\nDonald Trump wants you to be it was a record it's got to be jubilation it's gotta be unbelievable Julian and high fives and Billy bumps in the bunch left\nAnd then all of a sudden the new uses wanted to get her mission and dozens and dozens of people to find anything that possibly can on you shouldn't be needed was Kevin off can you relate to what are you must have gone through in the past month I'm guessing you can\nAbsolutely and you're right um you know the Obama administration and the media they sent that dozens and dozens and dozens and it was\nRight here where I'm standing right now in my yard literally in the yard to find anything but um yeah I could relate the thing that I disagree with judge Kavanaugh on is a proclamation that it has devastated or destroyed the family\nNo it doesn't destroy your family your circle the wagons it it actually um it can be used as he can get out there all that that um the marking that lies told about you\nAnd really use it at empathy for other people who go through a bunch of crap in this world is everybody does um use that you how are you to get out there and do the right thing and fight really really hard for the underdog\nFight really hard for those who don't have that platform that microphones to speak up for justice\nTo ensure apparently last question and thank you for doing this or I just have to know as you see the left\nBecoming even more on ... when you hit the national spotlight it was ten years ago now I'm ... and it was on him so ready\nBut now it's ridiculous they were people literally scratching the Supreme Court door as a vegetarian and stopping for being sworn in they've gone completely ... how do you counter balance that and how do we get the voices 'cause I think the majority of America on like that how do we get the voices of a normal people among us\nTo to rise to the top again or is that is that a really hard because the media is showing joined the ratings are getting some showing these idiots\nWell yeah I mean there's a triple threat against us that the media the opposing party and then rhinos within our own party letting this happen like that so\nI you know three against one but no we are already made manifest I think our need for a change in the system and um the corruption in the lack of accountability in twenty sixteen when what\nGenerally that the man as a person but that Trump movement where the people stood up and said enough is enough quote gotta go will make a difference but it's funny a couple of my girlfriends and I were checked in the last couple of days during the the cabin are discussions going\nOn in our little group of girlfriends out there that we would like these radical [laughter] you know we're getting they haven't gone how\nDo they think that's a fact of the more become unhinged I I think the more that I'm reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we say not enough is enough of that and uh we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government who we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like you who have got to be out there every day in the arena make you a different where you guys keep it\nOkay we're going to do that is there a ... billion along with millions of other Americans voted for you to vote for your heartbeat again I really appreciate you reach mountains thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much appreciate you\nWherever she

W using it needs to start with this one on Saturday Night in Vermillion\nIn South Dakota is no push all\nVery good football team a playoff team for a year ago first time ever South Dakota made it to the playoffs N. F. C. S. football last year there still a little upset I guess of the last they suffered in the uni don't to us during the regular season\nSo or they're looking for a little revenge on Saturday Night in there don't but they're they're\nThe other team in this league that's out to a to an all ... them in North Dakota state or tied for the topic to an all their a top twenty five ranked team\nSouth Dakota's rank twenty fourth of the nation un I goes into the game on ranks so that's a little bit different than recent meetings between these two programs so uh but they gotta they have a really good team especially off sensibly led by a and I was a kid at quarterback in in Austin Simmons\nTend to take a backseat if you will to other important issues like earning credits and you know I'm the academic peace and certainly the extra curricular activities which you know are really vital to you know the the success of youngsters in or secondary schools\nWith the Senate does that helps provide some opportunities for training for those secondary schools to increase their\nCapacity if you will of engaging a staff parents but also student leadership around this issue of preventing incidences of of harm and abuse and so that actually come to a ... a say a primary focus of the center\nLastly in addition to working with the the colleges and universities in Iowa as well to implement sexual assault prevention programming bystander approach programming on college campuses so working with\nSome amazing student groups you know in the Greek live resident live athletics student government um those student leadership groups on campus who you are also wanting to create a safe environment for everybody\n... program is new and it will be paid for with a federal Justice Department grant the monies were\nAs a result of ... the tragedy the recent tragedy that took place in Parkland in in Florida in high school although it wasn't just Parkland it was been a couple of culmination of\nMass shootings right particularly in school settings and so in response the federal government then I'm all allotted several million I think twenty five fifty million dollars worth of of grant money is to then\nBe used to support and community responses state responses commuter responses and solutions to preventing school violence and also increasing awareness and understanding about mental health and how all of those predictors if you will of violence or can be addressed so\nThe center of northern Iowa was fortunate enough to to partner with the department of education a director uh rind wise and his staff and together we submitted application on behalf of the state of Iowa to apply for funds to support\nTraining in Iowa across the state or for three years on those two issues of preventing school violence and also uh raising awareness understanding about mental health and understanding how\nThat all fits together we were um award in ... it was announced just last week that um I was a one of the recipients for the grandson so we are now are looking forward to I'm\nQuitting I'm a a schedule on a process by which schools can apply and we can get to work and engage\nA these focus conversations with school leaders can nine leaders stand leaders parents other constituents\nI'm Around these these topics\nI stir camp says the training will be in three parts one\nPart will be looking at and helping school and community leaders adopt a in evidence based framework to really look at the community and the school needs\nA needs assessment if you will the look at\nUsing a framework to I'd identify\nWith in multiple levels of the community what are we doing how are we operating as it relates to policy in practice as it relates to working in collaboration and networking what agencies are currently involved what are they doing around prevention right now what things could we be doing that we're not\nHow do we educate how do we ...\nIn bed and infuse this training in this education with in the enterprise of education if you will how do we make it a part of what we do\nEducationally and ending the identifying exactly what are those skills and and ... what is the knowledge that we want our youngsters to have as they go through our educational system and process what skills and knowledge do we need to have as adults\nTo communicate and to educate into work collaboratively with our parents and our students around school bonds prevention\nAnd so that's uh that that framework as is important because\nIt gives some it it gives us some guidelines and the structure to kind of take a ten thousand foot glad to see\nHow we doing you know we leaders in in any sector of the population need to be able to kind of take a look at that five thousand foot you to say how are we as an organization doing an operating and as it relates to\nSchool based violence as a race to violence in general there's some excellent things to be mindful of in terms of what we should have in place that's one area a second area\nIs actually in the um bowling and and violence prevention curriculum itself and we have been using in Iowa for the last Eighteen years\nQuite extensively a program called the mentors the mattress of violence prevention and I would couple that with also a program called ... boys in demand which\nIs an educational based program model has an a bystander approach means in other words it engages the conversation to ask themselves questions\nAs friends as classmates his teammates what responsibility do we have for each other how do we hold ourselves to others accountable what are some of the warning signs of ... in relationships when they\nStart to ah when there's a demonstration of behavior that might be potentially hurtful or harmful this happening around us what's our response to what do we say what do we do\nThat prevention that's addressing situations before things manifest themselves into either physical or emotional or some type of maybe even sexual abuse but those that's an important piece to to prevention because\nOftentimes when school violence manifest itself in the form of physical or aggressive or even violent a outburst like gun violence which again was a part of the uh impetus behind these grants is that you know ... or a communication device\nI asked ... camp to repeat what he just said\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] wonder\nWithout trying to to make it too simple um it is a way to communicate what you're thinking and feeling and it it can be a very threatening and deadly way to communicate what you're thinking and feeling\nI'm In prevention we're always thinking about going upstream\nHow what can we have done prior to that could have maybe impacted the outcome of the result of this and so we didn't think about\nIncidences of gun violence and let's take for example the ... in school right those those incidences while they occur elsewhere\nUm when there are when they happen in school it captures the attention of of news media and so therefore it captured the attention of our country right those who young men who have gone in and of of used a gun to to kill him to hurt and to threaten to harm others\nYou write those who are young men who have gone in and and as I used a gun to to kill him to hurt and to threaten the harm others um didn't start their their anger their their frustrations there\nWhat they were experiencing didn't didn't start with having a gun in their hand in barring shots\nAnd if you think about at that point in time what was really being demonstrated was um\nThere were no other options this this this young person this young man that come to a point where prior I'm a ways to communicate or to um somehow inform others about what was going on in his life\nUm he was past that and so that that that weapon in his hand was really communicating I'm In a deadly sort of way what was that part where he was at and so we think about\nPrevention\nYou know what were the missed opportunities or what would the opportunities before that in that communication listening speaking hearing I'm emphasizing a supporting a holding accountable youngsters ... woes of the situations where\nUm hindsight's twenty twenty where we hear the commentary often times of\nOf of the things that we could have done better or things that well there were some warning signs there were some things that this young person said um or there was a formation that we communicated to law enforcement or to school officials out of concern a on behalf of this young person\nAnd so again thinking about the guns as a way to communicate um it is it's almost the last straw\nAlan Hi ... camp with the un I Center for violence prevention or un eyes campus spotlight I'm Mark Morris

South Dakota's but in the Missouri Valley football conference gets the Panthers that were the top twenty five rank team and the coyotes were trying to knock off the top twenty five rank you and I deem the shoes on the other foot tonight\nRight now the Panthers or the hunters and not being honest so it'll be interesting to see how that plays out very it's not very often you know through the course of the Missouri Valley football cards that we've seen the fed is going to sit there and the underdog did they really just looking at it by the stats and the ranking could all\nYou'd have to say that if the ... that would be some more of an upset\nBoth teams loved to throw the football I think we're going to see both teams trying attack it off ... through the air today\nThe no doubt about South Dakota especially here you know there's I think would try to be more balanced you don't get that Russian attack going and then that opens up a lot of stuff for them but the the coyotes they got a strong aren't quarterback and they like to throw it all over the place [noise] it'll be interesting to see how the parents try to defend that today\nThey were in the playoffs a year ago for the first time in school history as a division one MCS program talking about South Dakota had an excellent quarterbacks then across Straggler but they seem to be just as good under Austin Senate or\nDoing a nice job no question about it he's one of those I Will get Jerry\nOne quarter back then or a Chris Straggler but they seem to be just as good under Austin Senate or he's\nDoing a nice job no question about is one of those our kids the route of Council Bluffs and then he's done a nice job of running this office he's a very effective throw the football when it needs to he could take off and run there's no doubt about is rushing stats\nYou know impose it to you but he's got two hundred yards on the ground and his first five ball games now the sack yard is goes against this Russian told us that brings down doesn't look like is the first year averages out that good but it's kicking rod he's not\nAs fast as much stronger kid was a year ago but he is very capable of taking on running you got to stay in your life you got to keep him and then you don't want to get an outside that pocket because he can make quick plays with his arm and hand history\nHe like done the panther quarterback a kid from Grinnell, Iowa had a big game a week ago against the top ranked in defending national champion North Dakota state vice and especially\nThrough the air the panther often get a game or we thought it might be a defensive battle turned into an often seek shootout banging throws ended up giving up fifty six points for fourth quarter touchdowns or the vice and you and I jumped on him early fourteen to not think put thirty one points up on the border we could go against that stout vice Cindy\nThat are normally thirty one points it's North Dakota state would be you know you think you'd have a good chance to win the ball game but some things got away from there on the fourth quarter dairy was the final score was an addictive of hospitals that game and was and how ...\nHardly fault it was a the panther set a good day plan to go on an especially on our fence that got off of that good I think that'll be important for us to tonight they do is going to be loud and here they got a

decoded though\nI don't remember his point very well up here Gary over the years that we're going coming up\n\n\nAgain it could be one of those high scoring affair so we'll probably have a defensive struggle\nNo question about a year that we never know all these things are going to go but you know what\nI expected to be a typical valley football games are valid football game it's going to be the same that can last into that fourth quarter and hang on and and it's going to come out of here on top but that's a tough task for this past year that they've got to put the north Dakota state game in

injuries and that type of thing what you always have this time of year Gary that's both teams are going to have some players that that are bang up maybe they go maybe we don't want to say don't we'll just have to wait and see who takes the field for the fact that the\nOne thing we do know is the Panthers are going to have kind of a new fence alignment today to face this ... pass\nCoyotes ball club
