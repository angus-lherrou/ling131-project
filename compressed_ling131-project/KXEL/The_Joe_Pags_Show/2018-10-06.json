I thought an outstanding effort today ought to be you and I think the deep end just wore down in that second\nEspecially that fourth quarter you know ironically talked about it that the parents are defense or the Panthers ... forty three to nothing in that fourth quarter and the previous four ballgames with that wasn't going to be the case today a North Dakota state stay with their game plan they executed it very well\nThey're nice job to rush into football the area that you know they do that a lot of teams\nAnd I don't know of course party will be disappointed about the Russian yards that they that the pets gave up today\nBut you know that the school right now it looks pretty lopsided but that wasn't really addictive I don't think of the game that was that was a good ball game for three three and a half corps and then you know they got a couple of a vote of scores light that we're kind of meaningless you know they were up ...\nIt was that was a good ball game for three three and a half corps and then you know they got a couple of ... of scores late that were kind of meaningless you know they were up ... batters had to go for it to try to get to get back in with the through scores in the fourth quarter\nAnd that didn't happen but it's also good thanks but it is North Dakota state do what to do man it's a it's a formula a lot of things try to match but but aren't able to you know everybody wants to be able to run the football throw it officially\nAnd play good defense that they're ... they're going to be a little upset I think it would give it up thirty one points and they gave up a lot of yards in the past year but\nThe Panthers Russian attack really never got going they weren't able to the un nice that you know as\n... and with a hundred and eighty hours last week that he had a state wasn't able to do that today and I don't really think the Panthers rushed to for a hundred yards do do they\nWell they they rushed it forty times today and did end up with a hundred and four yards but just to point six yard yeah or on the average in and you'll get the all the official stats before we wrap up our post game coverage but\nYeah that they're not anywhere near as affect you been the running game as they were at Indiana State but that has a lot to do with the defense they had to throw up against [noise] today uh I I thought the ... plan was good with the the throwing gain some of the screen passed up\nA and he lied done he hung in there for a long time today to to try and rally this team but they just couldn't get it done in the fourth quarter\nThat's some creative things that some good some good schemes going office has picked plays in the bed and do\nIt right away you couldn't ask for scripted better to come out ... jumped out at fourteen and nothing they get the crowd going you know put a little doubt in the minds of the by some but then we talked about is the fourth quarter game and it all and then they weren't going to go anywhere they weren't going to check their tails runner gets you don't get excited or change their game plan or they just going to stay the course\nThat's where they did and and they're so good at it that\nYou know the same old story but\nNever gets old for them I'm sure you know it's just a matter of anybody else could contrived topics 'cause it's just like where do you go you know they they do a lot of things well then you and I did a lot of things well today but at the end not enough things well to get the victory\nThe one injury that we know of the the looks serious ... big left there are a big left tackle ... going down a man he's battled injuries throughout his career he's the anchor of that often see why they came into this game\nBeing named the often see blind man of the week in the Missouri Valley football conference after how well him and the rest of his office he blind played a week ago at Indiana State with when that running game for you and I was just outstanding\nYeah we had him up on the other player the game because that that was the key against it in the states\nAnd those guys are the old I did a pretty good job of protecting me like that and he had a for the most part some pretty good time you got a couple of sex or or you know one of them late in the game that didn't really matter but ... that's a tough thing to go against him by large I thought the plane was good to try and attack that defense in the past year was ... you know that's as good as we've seen in a long time throwing a football around her [noise]\nAbsolutely right that final score does not indicate how close this game actually was today it got away from you in the fourth quarter but I I got to believe it was a defensive player standing on that side line and see in your op ed put up too quick scores and go up for you know nothing ... that whole sideline had to be just a electrified with that start\nYes uh I think we were we toss intercede when it come out on a somewhere made of a off and split outstanding uh I play against them every day during the week I Know what they can do and they did what they did and I'm proud of I'm really proud of off ...\n... from the defense each side of it and they put up a lot of yards on the ground they've got a great rushing attack what ... what was it that that made it tough for you guys today were they just getting to the edge was well did they catch you in some some deep and she calls the just\nA you know I I don't know if we're in really a bad call or that they ran to the boundary ... out of the ... and then went to that queen set and I tried to get on the perimeter ... that's really the only two runs they did I just I'm not sure why those are so open\nAnd you're you're going to face good running backs weak weak in and week out you did it when you when you played Montana I Will you'll do applying for but Bruce Sanderson alliance done a couple of pretty good running backs for North Dakota state aren't\nThey great running backs a run physical Reinhardt a coach preached all week arm tackles aren't going to take them down and that showed\nAnything specific at half time that was the main talk from the deep in the staff whether it was a a adjusting things making changes doing something different with personnel was there anything specific they tried to adjust at the break\nA really didn't do much adjusting their size like I said that queen set was really hurting us so a little bit personnel around\nI think they tried to adjust at the break\nA really didn't do much adjusting their size like I said that queen set was really hurting us so a little bit personnel around and just really focus on trying to stop that it got a call to try and stop then I think we did later on\nGoree you're kind of a hybrid type blur you that ... been playing safety or they could probably had prepared to do both this week didn't you ... where do you spend your time but was rumor yet coach vocal liquor or coach Johnson Tommy cost Johnson's room all the time [laughter] ah age has been battling the shoulder shoulder injury so\nWe prep this week like he wasn't going to play a sigh a practice that rover all week uh knowing that I knew nickel and then yesterday we found out that you're going to play and that's what I was gonna play nickel so\nGood at a big adjustment for you because you've been a safety in the past and and now you know it's a little bit we lining up different you got a little more responsibility probably their own game yeah my ... got to take on some tied in to tackle is that\nI've always played rover since I've been here but I got moved to Nicholas by my third game for game plan Nicholas I'm I'm really starting to mold into that position yeah double figures tackles that's a good I mean the other two ... led the team to attack was the\n... that's a normal for those guys there but you got involved in there are a lot to talk about your pass a responsibility what what what are you gotta you gotta you gotta play made a man at times I Would think right yep a nickel gets to do it all I got a blast play man to man or\nA mostly cover the flat scary wheels are\nAgain by today was hang on number twenty shepherds you get a receiver so we're trying to get him out of the game but I'll credited him he's a good receiver we'll talk a little bit you can\nBelmont I Will not that far away or who uh what other schools looked at you and why did you decide to come to you and I\nUh you know I had some other schools in this conference to look at me but when I came here it's it's not too far from home a ghost Johnson that really I really like coach Johnson not just a great guy great coach or does everything right or just the atmosphere love playing in the dome or the ... it's\nJust the whole environment is fun I tell you what I was impressed with what you're doing you're making that switch way in a different position in the end you're learning doing it well Korean like we've talked you just got to put this won't behind you made some ... some good things today and and and as a team just keep going forward\nYeah thank you yeah well yeah showed we can anybody and it's got to keep the trend going in place to play the rest of your right good luck congratulations thank you\nThanks for joining us after the game today\nA Corby sander our village in paint their deep in the player of the game and as Peter mentioned Corby ten tackles a in this one today against North Dakota state stay with us we're back with more ripple skiing coverage\nFrom the ... right after this fifty six thirty

W our class size pickups every five hundred pounds CBW weren't based on for segmentation\n[noise] as soon as the Panthers sports radio network [noise] back in our poll\nSkiing coverage of you and I dance or football here this afternoon from the uni don't let's go\nThrough some of the plays of the game the un I Panthers one the toss and they elected to receive the football they a lot of times they'll they'll differ\nBut today they wanted the football and the opening dry they put together and impress the three point eight Seventy five yard touchdown scoring drive\nThis big pass play is what put the Panthers up on the scoreboard first\nWritten in a lot for Meg attack because these are pretty safe yeah they're good at that level you know you've got a good run and play that time of night over why Miller came\nTo the near side Mick Shane [noise]\nWhy lap with costs either going to get fake it and then\nPaying thirty us right it's a good running by Gary was a key to that started at all and now we're going to stay for the we're not going to let him on the football I like that they brought everybody up here a little pressure package pay the price there 'cause safety came and did not see rather more released this little scene Rob I'd rather more done all kinds of time to throw it in there well designed play\nAnd then the Panthers brought on Austin earth some he kicked the extra point good and just fifty six seconds into the ballgame un I lead North Dakota state by the score a seven to nothing the Panthers would get a deep and see stopgap the foot ball back\nAnd the Panthers starting at their own a yard line put together another impressive often see Dr in March the football down to the north Dakota state aid yard long and scored again in the first quarter on their second off in the possession on this play\nAmerica First in gold a gold at the yard line Panthers and the red zone whether a hundred percent on your store and they are going to hand it off the market is why Miller terms or right corner pike market\nThe\nNothing and they try and make it\nThe good ever bite mark his wife or they want to mess with a nice father got on the line backer safety cribs or discovered over it is a very big lawyer markets was able to jump forward the shoulder stretches arm out get that body zone\nAustin Earth I'm would add the extra point and was seven thirty five left to play him the first quarter the un I Panthers were on top sport keen to nothing that was after us Seventy five yard touchdown scoring drive and in Ninety two yard\nTouchdown scoring drive for the purple and gold North Dakota state\nUh Panthers nearly shut them out in the first quarter but North Dakota state started a drive with their own forty four and with thirty five seconds left in the first quarter and east\nFirst quarter but North Dakota state started that drive at their own forty four and with thirty five seconds left in the first quarter and eastern stick to bury a shepherd twenty yard touchdown pass play and North Dakota state was on the scoreboard with thirty five seconds left\nIn the first quarter they added the extra point\nCamp Peterson kicked it through and they kept the un I lead right inhabit fourteenth this up and then in the second quarter after an interception by North Dakota state and starting at the un I Panthers thirty three they would move it to the panther three yard line in eastern stick\nWould hook up with alliance done on a three yard touchdown pass play twelve fifty five love to play in the half\nThe extra point was get good and we were tied at four teen all with twelve fifty five to play in the first half then the panther ... after that\nBikes and touchdown would go back to work move the football to the base in twenty four and the Panthers regained the lead on this touchdown scoring play\nThe screen games Hindu go pretty good today is that something you thought because of the pressure that the north Dakota state was going to bring would be there\nYeah I'm ... their defense align the priest in ashes and they like to get after quarterback and uh you know we knew that if you come off the ball pretty hard so we just you know made a couple of strays and then worked for the most part\nOf the most part the odds of it all starts with production if you don't get protected you're not going to be able to throw those things those guys did a pretty good job and tell us about left tackle del Cal Twain did do you do anything at this point about ...\nUh I don't know anything about this point I'm a I just I don't know anything right now I'm just pray for 'em and you know hopefully I'll be All right\nWell and that often see blind did a pretty nice job today and protection didn't that\nThey did um I don't know if you really find them throw the football as much as we did the day a but for or against that defends allied against the defense or they do a lot of different stunts that a lot of different looks and they prepare their butts off of getting the right protection and and and they they got after today and they did they did their their their job uh today\nThat I thought that that touchdown and machine where you take the little screen first that was that takes a lot of footwork on your part to get the shoulders around that bumped really\nSo yeah I was going to play 'em you know he just popped and I just try to get it to on the line held up and ... and beyond me to play\nHow are you feeling it's a physical defense you see down there you took some you took some ... times how you're feeling at this point\nA little sore um you know obviously were disappointed that that we lost a they're really good team no uh there's a lot of things that we can build off during the game um we we have a lot of confidence in what we're doing and we know we we come in\nAnd and play each game like we did the today coming out the that will will be successful\nWell congratulations I thought that was an outstanding effort in your teammates to it doesn't know fortunate discord and looked like that but I thought you guys have been shown improvements to me today yeah\nKeep up the good work ... good luck next week at South Dakota thanks for joining us to share the guys that he lied done our village in panther ... player of the game the senior quarterback\nOut of Grinnell, Iowa we need on network stations identified themselves let's do that right now let's pause ten seconds for station identification\nYou're listening to panther football\nDriven by Ford firmly or feel [noise]\nThe official home of a un I Panthers is voting KFC Waterloo Cedar Rapids\n\nWelcome back to our post gain coverage of you and I panther football\nHere this afternoon from the unique ... North Dakota state gets the victory fifty six thirty one over the Panthers it's time to talk with you and I panther head football coach mark Farley the coach Farley post game interview was brought to you by Nissan Nissan row the best drive on game day Nissan proud supporter\nOf college athletics lot to talk about coming off this one here today coach but first of all got to talk about\nThe great start to this one got out of the gate early with those two quick touchdowns won the toss and took the football to start this one\nToday [noise] yes and uh I thought are often did a great job today I thought he lie who just had a tremendous job offensive line really played well receivers caught contested catches blocking down field tremendous effort by our football team but tremendous a\nProduction offer off debts to to do what they did get thirty one and not get the wind is disheartening because it's\nFootball team but tremendous uh\nA production offer off debts to to do what they did get thirty one and not get the wind is disheartening because we gave up points on defense and [noise] you know plan that kind of game again we all know what kind of game this isn't usually it's a\nIt's it's very close game not very my points scored probably more score points of ... and this whole football game so are are off fans are offensive coaches great plan\nA man we played I played on the fence and then we met we miss some tackles and\nIt's disheartening the score got out of there but we're calling for the went when you're going forward on third fourth down in your own thirty we came here to win the game and our guys walk away knowing that they get every chance to win and not just worry about a ... point total because the ones who has a lawful awesome\nBut our our team played hard and I'm very America's ... they did nothing wrong we miss someplace and they may supplies\nOr a game in which is hard to run the football against North Dakota state but it seemed like the running game just was good enough today to keep 'em on us to help in the play action passes some of the screen passes and just some of the other reads the ill I made when when the running game was good enough they seem to be bringing some guys up to to try and stop the run\nWell we're running the ball\nI thought we were on the ball well as I look back on right now and I remember seeing a football field as we were we were we were getting forty hours five yard for Kerry when Iran of football and they were getting two running backs were getting extra yards that put us in a second five seconds six were allowed to\nDo you have to play I actually work in a rundown feel all day long on him and put it simply action at open up all the slots and kept them off\nIt kept him out of pressure I mean they tried to bring the house every way shape and form and tried to\nTried to ... early but we kept coming back and kept coming back and even for half time jolted them by getting a field goal before they even left the field because we were going for the land and we put it on the table going for it to fifty yard line okay that could have been the difference in the game but\nThen we went for their and our defense when I stopped or right away so our guys went for the when I got no\nIssues with how they play 'cause we done a lot of things better absolutely but they brought they brought their game to the table today and and\nI Wish we had a better defensive ah we we lost on the guiding rushing and and give up too much on the Russian game I kept popping outside we had to plug dumping it out to the edge and made the speed to go down the sideline\nJust talk about that with the defense did they just they what was it something that that their players just adjusted and were good enough to execute some of that or was it you know some different play calling that maybe you hadn't seen out of out of there often\nWhat I saw with I watch a film there's one place that was a great play they call and that was when we when it hit thirty one twenty eight and then they hit that played out in the same that was they made an adjustment to an adjustment we adjusted halftime they readjusted [noise]\nThey got us okay that was a good call\n[noise] other than that there was no it was we miss the tackles we didn't get up blocks and that's where I saw from the sidelines but I'm not putting it on them I should have found a way to get them on the edge and try to get a guy free but for some reason kept popping off the yeah Jeffrey plugged up the mental and then he had enough speed but on the sideline to get more out of it\nYeah a lot of office today I just it never would have thought that that many points to be put on the border to good quarterbacks build it out you lie down was really good today in the eastern sticky he's he's not just one of the best quarterbacks in the valley but he's one of the best quarterbacks an F. C. S. football\nEastern when I was just like he was nine for fifty last week I think he was ... he wanted because he broke out we I go back to our defense what I'll tell him tomorrow is we kept him in the pocket he didn't get away on the scrambles\nUh we did a good job there a healing through Fifteen times ... where we failed was in the Russian game that we did not get the tackles we weren't good tackling football team\nIn that part of the game and that's where I saw there two running backs won the game because they burst out the side [noise]\nI didn't I thought her internal guys did good on defense I just didn't think our premiere cat got it now I don't know why they say right now but that has get cleaned up\nCoaches are going in that had signed up the momentum like you said that was I guess you'd call by you guys go for it but then that difference really rose did you did you give them a little pep talk before they went out there to get that stop or was that just something they took it upon themselves\nThey took it upon themselves I mean we came we came to play that's what we talked about it it's just what we said we want to be and\nYou have to take those I Want I Want them to believe they can do those things and when when we went for got got stopped short yeah that was that could have been a huge momentous fully ripe for halftime\nAnd but I tell you what defense that's what they're supposed to do is when when the fence goes for they got to go cover to cover my tail for calling it that way because I called and we didn't get it so they got to go cover me up to make sure that they stop and get the ball back and they did and they didn't blink and\nYou know those are the good things that happened but you know there's so many good things that it's it's hard to walk away like a good cause you got the man if we can I think I think he saw American football game day\nA very entertaining game and it showed me the physical you are right there with another you know the final score people see that around the country might think found other blow up but there really wasn't the case that was a to score game you know ... midway through that fourth quarter\nIt was a two possession and we yeah yeah and I knew the gamble should apply there if we want to protect the score and look good we what are we to\nBomb and he'll probably been game over and they were trying to drive away to their round the clock out yeah but I didn't think that was the right thing to do for the guys that fought that hard fought that long they wanted to fight to win so that that's why we came to\nDo yeah I saw a saw some growth today's no question about it and then looking at it from an officer standpoint there's a lot of weapons those guys I mean you you'd be hard to prepare for I think as a defensive looking at it meant you got you got more conducive they got the two running backs of both of them catch the ball well wide receivers that can really do some things\nI think you've got a very talented off at school right\nNow well I think the\nReceivers of improved so much says early in the season those first two games and you can see them catch in their own and now they're making tremendous catches up locking down feels that it's a balance that we put Sunni on off and he made a place for us today jailing James made some great catches ... made some catching runs\nI mean and then you got you know why Miller Trevor got the screens going for so a screen as it were on a when you look at if you know football screens around it's not a passing the screen screen hurt him because they were they were attacking so hard you could dumping on them and and go get the yards that way so\nAh the punting game was fairly even the the ... ... to five times for thirty eight point to yard average Panthers part of the four times for forty point guard average a note kickoff returns of the no today um [noise]\nTime of possession ended up pretty even Panthers headed for thirty minutes and thirty seven seconds the base and held it for twenty nine minutes and twenty three seconds\nOne big you know the the pages that the only turn over did an interception devising turned it into seven points you know and at the time as you look at it you know I think it's well it's a twenty eight point game I really wasn't we talked about that but\nThat was that was a big factor there they were able to score off that turn over and\nThen ended up being a difference maker but you know it was one of those things that sometimes stats can lie a little bit but\nBoth teams and it's a pretty darn good things about physically which is surprising because normally this is like a rock 'em sock them you know a ... a just a defensive battle normally twenty Twenty one points we'll get the thing done but not today a little different story [noise]\nBefore we do go just wrap it up put up a vote on it and wrap it up from your view Scott Peterson of what you saw today before we have to look ahead to a road game at South Dakota next week\nYeah I'm not looking to add to that but to me the number one team of the country came in here the the best program over the last decade and that's yes football came into this place and the Panthers went toe to toe with them for more than three course now to get away from yeah it did then mess what North Dakota state does do a lot of teams but in my mind\nThey should have some confidence both ... you know even though they're going to you're going to have some things on the fence it got to get cleaned up no question about\nBut often silly I think you know they had the running game it's going pretty good uh a week ago and that was some effective runs today that that ... those things they could do end up as a game with the flash and that type of things during games go\nI see it often sets made leaps and bounds since that first game and and so now you've got six games to go ride your two or three reality I was asked where you're at you got six games\nCan you run the table we've seen it seemed pretty good towards the end of the year they've done it before I had done it in the in the past they can do it again and I think that the defense of

in the end uh [laughter] never Dakota said just a little bit too much I've got some first have thoughts I Want to share um maybe have time for a special gashed I'm not sure yet\nBut I have a special guest in Studio we'll see if we have time for that but really this is your shows so panther fans what do you want to talk about this afternoon give me a call three one nine two three five Fifteen forty or eight hundred five eight four seven zero to for\nThose are the numbers to call in and share your thoughts about this are you and I panther game here this afternoon in the unit down well it started great and it really couldn't have started any better for the Panthers they they come out on fire too long touchdown drives back their first derived um\nWas it three place Seventy five yards touchdown boom wrapped about seven now that I Believe they held at North Dakota state if it wasn't bringing out they made him pond I don't think it was a three now they might have gotten one first down\nOr maybe too but um North Dakota state punted you and I got the ball back nine plays Ninety two yards later you and I touched down we're up fourteen up and everything looking great for the Panthers and really it it\nKind of stay that way the entire um first how they kind of went back and forth about for a while I thought oh man this is we're going to get into an absolute shootout\nAnd uh I was a little nervous about one because I'm like oh I don't know if we want to get into a shootout with North Dakota state but to you and I looked to be up to the task kept up with them just fine and I'm\nReally look good defense was forcing bonds um the offensive line was great the defensive line was doing well everything really seem to be going just fine in fact I'm the only thing that did not go well but this was kind of a the key for the game was uh the rushing North Dakota state\nAt a hundred and Seventy two rushing yards in the first half to unionize fifty seven but you and I was kind of lighten it up in the year are you I don't have to hundred fifty six yards in the uh the first half North Dakota state only fifty six yards um\nSo yeah it was we we were doing well and it looks like we've got a caller let's get right to it Brian from Marion Brian what's going on man\nHey man I was going pretty good how are you doing tonight\nOh this looks right ah I just wanted to go first off that and a half North Dakota state everybody's talking about birth than than last started [noise]\nOr anything or their office wind just kill 'em they're having an eight way for you to carry\nAnd then the other thing I'd like to say that uh I don't want to discover even as soon as the action that it's just a terrible performance on them for a game like that I mean if we're to beat them they can I Can't stand that field and go crazy and they don't even show up I mean I just that's pathetic on their part and I'm calling them out and I hope something gets done about it so\nAll right thanks for the call Brian Banks All right have a good one I Love it Brian from Marion calling people out [laughter]\nNow I watch the game I was not at the game so I I Will not comment either way but you know what\nI don't think Brian is going to make that comment unless there was some there were some uh accuracy to that so I'm United students what's going on you been called out step it up moment to say about that\nUm yeah hat's off to North Dakota state they really look good and a nice little homecoming for Mr Lance done Waterloo west a llama unfortunately slip by panther recruiting and um well kind of made them pay for it so\nYeah he had a very nice game it was um\nAnd the first half just going back to some of those stats and again something you want to talk about you agree with Brian you disagreed Ryan\nLet the let me know three one two three five Fifteen forty eight hundred five eight four seven zero to for the number to call a to get in on the home of the Panthers dot com post game call in show five hundred and forty one at Toto yards in the first half North Dakota state had two twenty eight you and I had three Thirteen\nAnd the one thing it but as far as\nProblems I saw ... there are there was one big issue\nI had were the first half and I'm Sorry this was an officiating thing I'm\nThey had were touchdowns so yeah All right\nLet's take another call Sean from Des Moines to Shaun what's going on in the capital city buddy\nMay get a pounding the pavement on the way back a bond game with Bert ... is the first thing I Want to do your best shot up my boy Bryan that called in and um he is right about that in fact it was just a few short years ago when that all died would it be jam packed\nAnd now with nectar man on the field or I I definitely wanted the student or\nMake it happen and now they are ... outside of that is it is a kind of a rhetorical question but if it thirty one or better yet or and what\nAre you going to wind the quarter back up in a shot then I saw that and I'm like you have got to be kidding me are setting ourselves up with a three yard deficit right there to line them up and they shot got we got one yard it go\nDo this do that did not like the that kind of like all I Know that they didn't like\nWhat are we were doing really well on cross route on short paths crossed route or like to see that continue in the fourth quarter um didn't see that much and then the ball the game that kind of away from us and the thing I Do that I liked was\nWe're running a hurry up off but we're getting three and four and five yard almost every play during that hurry up or scored comes around and we start doing it\nSo I'm you know thirty one point now it'd be that uh the deep end we had a big issue there but er garlic they're still areas are improvement and or I Want to see continued improvement and I want to do the rest of the goal undefeated\nExcellent I totally agree I agree with you on that or the fourth one call Brian I was watching and I'm like and we've been running it pretty well you've got 'em why Miller you've got Alan I'm like really those that are friends of mine you guys can't pick up a yard\nWhat's motivating to line up in a shotgun lined up in the junk on it yeah what am I ... and the ball off and you got a yard to I I totally and then there was another fourth one I Believe where instead of running up the middle they ran to the left\n... where are you ... you got that right while you're running short run right up the middle I mean there's all kinds of line is good enough\nTo gain a yard guys I I I one hundred percent agree with that call\nYeah Brian from Mary and needs to be called them play the un I pick up right from Mary and he he can get them play calling and there'll be happier dead\nOutstanding [laughter] All
