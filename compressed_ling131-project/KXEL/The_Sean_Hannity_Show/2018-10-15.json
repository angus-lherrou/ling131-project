wrote this book is that we have to get we have to start to understand what these rules are based on and find some way to control the growth of this administration state\nNow you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong but as our government has gotten broader and some would say more complicated more invasive\nCongress will pass a law and then they differ many of the specifics of an acting abroad policy to administered of agencies and to me the Internal Revenue service of the best or worse depending on your viewpoint example of this sort of thing Congress comes up with these broad\nIdeas put them into law\nAbdicate if you will responsibility for carrying it all out to these agencies is that where they have just mushrooms in terms of their growth and therefore they're important\nYes that's exactly right and if we don't get too technical about this from a legal point of view Jeff um we have a constitution that limits legislation to Congress Congress as the only agency that can make the laws\nAre but if they pass these very general laws and then leave the implementation of those laws to administrative agencies\nIt turns out that the administrative agencies are making most of the law and that is the problem that I think\nI Am and many other people are worried about because uh these agencies are based in Washington they're made up for people who live in Washington I'm Joe the priorities that they are pursuing\nAre the priorities of the bureaucrats in Washington and not what the American people authorized through Congress\nThat and now okay that that's a great thirty seconds elevators thanks yeah ... actually I'm just hoping million passionate about it that it's easy to talk about what is it that you do [noise]\nIn reality in reality I got help those kids\nYeah really to help them learn I'd say the biggest part is that mentorship PSU not having that accountability uh checking in with them making sure our program is running\nProgram that's running smoothly where the coffee shop later somebody broke at this I'm like that yeah you know the biggest part in a lot of these the if they don't have\nParents for financial compensation to help them through school or you know maybe the government assistance they get is not going to put them through to a bachelor's degree so that's where we ... we have that extra funding per student\nTo say hey if you want to go towards your bachelors we're going to help you get there\nWhat about the trade schools and things like that or are you strictly into the four year program just\nFour year program as of now you know

really just advocating for the ... and we'll get large donors in large support you know it's not all about the money but it does take the money to fund the scholars let's\nLet's talk a little bit about the young people to cheer how long have you been doing\nJust shy of a year now I came on the board of directors a but a cool part of the story I was actually a recipient of this scholarship when I was in college so that's why it's very near and dear to my heart of course\nAnd this has been going on for how long the program at south oh goodness I should've I step on last time I think shy in ten years around there\nThe reason I'm asking that is I'm Wondering do you do any longitudinal studies or follow some of these young people that have been scholarship recipients\nFollowing their successful education\nYeah sorry I Love that do come out yet we have him on our faith based on page and our website so we do keep track kind of what they're up to now and follow through with their fix

yes yeah so there's a couple of shows right now I produce I play a lot of cats I think it's a great way for people to learn for free now mind you there are so many just resources at our fingertips so huge believer in pi casting and radios and all that stuff but [noise]\nNeither side from that I did write my book last year so February sticks of last year I published my books foster that fosters\nIt ended up hitting a best seller actually so I was really proud of that in my book really was kind of highlighting my Journey Through foster caring adoption the little preview we shared now but going more in depth of all the different components that\nYou know made me who I Am so I interviewed my biological dad was just amazing [noise]\nFirst time I heard his voice on the phone and talk to him about our story\nI really got a better perspective of you know what was going on in his mind and my biological mom mind you know all the drugs they were doing all those different things that led us into foster care 'cause\nI never knew those things really you know we we knew enough that they weren't suitable at the time but it was pretty amazing to be able to really interview and put some pieces together\nUm I also had my younger sister write a chapter in their\nAh my adoptive mom and dad so it was really cool just to be able to time my story together and [noise]\nKinda just have a as a visual hey everybody that this is what happened to me I made it through here some inspiration for you kind of things soap\nAnd inspiration for bad idea\nNo no and there are so many people that I Know can benefit from my story and just me having that voice and being able to speak out and being vulnerable at so many people can relate to and I just I Know that I was supposed to help people so that was kind of the driving force behind the bugs\nWill talk a little bit about your life\nYour recipient of fish you I can understand why you're so passionate about it and yet this do for you [noise]\nSo it really allowed me more time to focus on my studies that allowed me to even do get a bachelor's degree because I was kind of on my own schooling I'm I kind of bonus special category since I was in foster care then adopted and then back into foster care that age [laughter] and we can go for that too\nBut the age range it I didn't line up to meet the requirements where I Would be considered independent so I still had to go off of my adoptive parents' income\nAnd at that time they weren't you know they didn't really want to help me through school so I was kind of mind my own so to say and unfortunately I didn't get many grants I didn't get you know what normal kids would in my situation so the guardian scholars foundation how did you find out about\nOh yeah it was really kind of a strange circumstance I was at a coffee shop coincidentally\nWith my older sister in a social worker we were talking about placement with my younger brothers at that time\nAnd just kind of getting hit by I have a very great story um but yeah we're getting some advice from her and I was telling her at the time I was going to school fulltime working full time and she just stopped me and asked how it was doing that and I just didn't know any better I knew I had to pay for my college and my bills so I thought that was normal I had\nTo and she let me know about the program I applied and generously enough they gave me a scholarship so\nHigh you know this was and we will talk about the guardian scholarship foundation but the you opened up a door here that Governor Walker or just a moment um and and I don't want to necessarily know your personal story although I'm managers probably profound just from what I've heard so far [noise]\nWhat about the whole foster system and the adoption system\nI understand that there are numerous families out there willing to adopt produce system takes forever to get through\nA sometimes the foster system doesn't work as well as with has there's been news stories about all kinds of negative issues I Know we don't hear the both positive things often but negative issues what was your experience through the whole issue\nHall or a while yeah and again mine was unique which most cases are but I was initially in foster care it two years old I really stemming from my biological parents just not being sent to parent you know they really struggled with addiction\nThe lifestyle isn't appropriate for you know babies to be living in so thankfully my mom made the decision to put my sister and I into foster care\nSo being so little I don't remember a whole lot you know being that young so we were in a couple of foster homes until we were adopted I was adopted at five years old and things are good you know that transition was easy and that but getting older then I started to struggle with\nYou know why wasn't with my family issues exactly and yeah during my teen years it's just that was the most challenging time was really finding out who I was you know if I belonged in this adoptive families I didn't know how I had so much family\nSo I ended up really acting out you know I didn't know how to use my voice writer channel my emotions ended up back in the foster care actually add one ten year old yes\n... so you're adopted parents that we're we're playing this yeah\nWell I definitely gave them the ring around and you know we try counseling they tried to scare tactics you know putting me and detention centers and all these things and I just I didn't want to less than I just wasn't you know I just couldn't even express how I don't get a positive way and it just always done it out in negative actions so [noise]\nOkay [noise]\nSo a little preview there but yes I was back in foster care than [noise]\nYou know this is this is really interesting conversation to have because\nYou're so oftentimes we hear about young people that have been through the system as they say you don't always necessarily turn up\nIn a positive way because there's all kinds of things that we generally do listening to this was for just a moment just for a moment\nHow tough it is to be a teenager anyway I mean with all of the things that are going on ... you know you've got your group pressure you jog or a parent parental pressure you've got ... but if you have an identity crisis", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city":
