in ... in the state\nBut you got all the time you need now we're really deadlines with that [laughter] I'm Serious Jeff your great thank you very ... ah you were not as kind to Joe Biden I don't think within the past our tell us about the news conference that you held with the lieutenant governor in Cedar Rapids\nWell there was a couple of things yeah that that we wanted to discuss what you know one one is this whole idea of of taxes I you know in our last minute Yemen power desperate attack but it's it's almost hard to believe he was like I was what would buy this that\nThe threat level is suggesting that Martin him but Kim Reynolds would actually increase taxes which obviously she signed into a into law\nThe largest a tax cut in history now you ... percent of the middle class get those tax cuts when everything's ramped up on it just it gets back to desperation um you don't have a credible has been very very clear that are that the taxes will lead to be looked at\n'em and he is going to raise taxes even doubled down on Iowa perhaps and said all that stuff and you look at and then the ... you know tied into that\nOf course is the thinking our who has who has was also criticized Rob ... of them are voting for the tax cuts and so the two of these that are that are ... of these individuals that are guaranteed to vote to raise taxes I guess for everything that's on\nIf I'm if I'm Nancy Pelosi but given permission to vote that way but we all assume that she would and so the bottom line is you know we have this irony here the eleventh hour them trying to deflect what they have clearly said and try to push some of the some some of the ... the\nQuestion was on to the governor the second part of this was Joe Biden coming in by the way Joe Biden the vice president who actually called the federal tax cuts I and I quote obscene\nOr when he was in Pennsylvania I'm this is nothing but a ... that we're so I'd say for I mean this this shows we knew that Rob bomb was pulling clubs and we knew that uh that that get mental had kept governor's race cause we always knew that it was going to be close but even after\nAll the dollars that have been sunk into this campaign\nAnd in the case of blurb eight million dollars\nA was Bush did and then at the unions have just bumped into another two hundred thousand dollars against them\nAll of a sudden things have tightened up roads gone from Fifteen down to a statistical dead heat and in in ... and uh the Joe Biden said specifically he would be in his words they use Jeff was conspicuously ...\nUnquote and here he is he's in Iowa and he was in Iowa because\nPeople and I understand it Abby Finkenauer it's going to raise taxes and threaten almost going to raise taxes and so Joe Biden's going back on the word and he's going to go out there is going to campaign for him and I I Know fair game he can certainly do that but this shows that should show everybody just how desperate we used to campaign to become\nAnd in fact for the former vice president to come to Iowa he campaigned here a couple of times in the caucuses not tremendously successfully as I recall\nI covered both of them so that's how I recall it he's making noises himself about twenty twenty is is is more about Joe Biden or a more about Democrats in Iowa and one of these Eighteen\nWell I think if you look at Joe Biden's a career I think everything he does his about job I but I I you know I I obviously I don't I don't even know if we can do\nWell I think if you look at Joe Biden was a career I think everything he does his about job I but I I you know I I obviously I don't I don't even know if we can differentiate too because Joe Biden is a weird yeah true he's a former vice president but he's also I'm getting very conspicuous himself about not ruling out a rod\nAnd so yeah I I think this is about I think this is about a a a potential a nominee that once in a couple of a of a high profile Democrats to be beholden to it\nAnd I think it's a perfect match um you know he called the tax cuts obscene credible luxury taxes every thinking are wants to raise taxes might as well bring in the vice president wants to raise taxes will have a tax rates are down down home party I guess\nAs opposed to a barn raising will have a [laughter] there you go\nWe're talking with Jeff Kaufmann he is the chair of the Republican Party of Iowa you're on TALK Fifteen forty KFC out so if it is as a parent as you say that you've got a high profile Democrats coming in to help out other Democrats and the state's second largest city\nWhy is it necessary for you and the lieutenant governor to come and do a news conference\nIn Athens welcoming the vice president with open arms and welcoming as in air quotes of course\n[laughter] absolutely um I think we want to make sure that uh our side of the story is told we want to make sure for especially for those independent voters\nThat are still making up their mind in this race for those Republicans that are still trying to decide if they're going to fill out an absentee ballot or those are those Democrats are out there that are that are that don't want their taxes increased I think we need to make sure\nAnd point out what may be obvious to those of us to follow politics but may not be obvious to the individual groups that I've just mentioned\nThat this is about this this this this way she's going to be is going to turn on whether I Want their taxes increased or not\nWe just want to make sure that the other side is heard\nAnd down and make sure that the you know the smoke and mirrors that are obviously going to come out a from a from the former vice president and put on Hubble and if any thinking are indeed has gotten permission from Nancy Pelosi tough to say what you say we want to make sure that we got we got ... I but I Believe is the truth on our side\nYou have a Republican in the governor's chair you have a Republican in the first district in in the third district\nAs the chair of the party obviously you'd like all three to win but there is a very different things going on here and so my basic question is if the governor does well is that going to help the members of Congress or conversely if the members of Congress do well will that\nHelp elevate the governor and I say this because congressman Lamborn his district last time by more when President Trump won the district\nThat you know that's a that's an excellent point and say it's actually almost more of an academic question that it is a political question\nUm I think I think it really depends on the community\nI think it depends on on on where we are talking for instance I think I think you know in in Cedar Rapids for example where a congressman bomb and the governor both worked on that plug a wall project and then and then a congressman bomb was able to bring\nYou know bring home the bacon so to speak I think I I think there's gonna be kind of a mutual wrapping up between the two I think Rob bomb in Dubuque for example I think I think there's a lot of people that love their native son\nAnd I think an association with ... will help the company or their um I I I really think it's very geographic a ditch geography specific\nIt might even be demographics Pacific\nI'm On the uh you know the western edge of the state obviously um or or in the extreme western edge of the district I should say that the state um you know there there's there's probably going to be a neutral help we're maybe perhaps congressman bomb may not have been able to to to be as often as some as as she would like to be\nSo I think it all depends I I I Do think\nThe importance of Joe Biden company actually helps both the governor's campaign ... campaign because you're right what us federal and state\nBut we have overlap here in that you have a federal\nCandidate in ... an hour in a state candidate incredible that both are bonding over the over the ability and their desire to raise taxes and then they brought in\nA former vice president that is called the tax cuts of sea so people aren't perspective they are actually doing our workforce by trickling\nDown on their desire to raise taxes so I I'm actually at the honest with you and kind of an odd sort of way I'm kinda glad or a Joe Biden came to town because I think it's going to be further proof and more obvious for governor Reynolds around to make the case that\nThat that indeed taxes are going to increase the votes of the Democratic way this is a lecture\nThe more they talk to the better you like it because people will hear what they have to say in what they really stand for so I've got about Ninety seconds we talked in your office in Des Moines about five weeks ago and you told me what your biggest concern was then once it now just a few days before just a week before the election your biggest concern AS Party chair is what\nI ... it's my answers the same Jeff in its complacency Republicans show up to about either absentee right now or on Tuesday\nA lot of them will be re elected and Kim Reynolds will be the first female governor to be elected in our state history we have Republicans are complacent this thing's going to be a nail biter all the way to the end so my worry still it is the same Republicans do not rest on what you think\nHas gone well Republicans make sure you get out there and vote and that goes for independents and Democrats to that don't want their taxes raised\nWhat are you Leslie and the party doing in this final week can I say that because it used to be there wasn't a big crunch or the week prior\nWill now so many people do early voting I'm On record not being in favor I Want to have all the information in front of me and I want to go walk into a polling place on Tuesday Morning and then have a nice breakfast afterwards so\nWhat are you doing in this last week\nIn addition to all these early voting efforts that I Know you've been doing just like the Democrats have to get your presence out and I've got about thirty seconds I'm\nWe're more than ten thousand you and I alumni educators and they are employed in Ninety nine percent of our school districts in across all of our Ninety nine counties so essentially we're talking about our teachers are in every single corner of the state and that's a great thing for us we feel good that we're able to reach the entire state of Iowa and\nI think that's something that people think about when they think of you and I as a way of uh we have a really good base in teaching and so it's a really good thing for us to\nUm to continue to educate people on how well they're doing\nWe're also one in four undergraduate students is ... is studying to become a teacher and again\nTakes a lot of students to fill our state with with educators and so it's it's good to know that we still have those incoming students who\nWant to make an impact with kids um and to be an educator and so um it's been great to work on um it's been a lot of fun to\nKind of get out of my world a little bit because you're right this isn't exactly a typical marketing directors area or that they are involved in but it's been fun and ultimately we are wanting to reach individuals\nGet them to come to the dome and enjoy their time and that's that's what we're trying to do here\nElevating educators starts with making contacts lots of them with those who went on to become teachers at drivers says this effort is not just a one time thing\nWe want this to be a lifelong initiative that you and I will continue we want this to be something that in Twenty years it is as recognizable as America's ... America needs farmers that's our goal and so what we're doing is we're starting right now of just making those connections we want to make sure that\nTeachers are aware that we're trying to lift up their profession and elevate the profession and so\nRight now what we're doing is uh we had a registration open for\nA educators to sign up to receive to free tickets to uh the Missouri state football game on November seventeenth we had a smashing success with with that first registration\nAnd essentially sold out of the the tailgate tickets that we had available opened up a new registration that included a just tickets to the game and again that also a hit its capacity and so\nWe know that the supporters there we know that teachers um and educators want to get back to a northern Iowa and the EU and our campus and so we just want to make sure that everybody that has an opportunity or want the opportunity to come back and you know enjoy a football game day has that opportunity\nDrivers says un I has always prided itself on teaching teachers but for those who are still learning when they graduate it's all about jobs\nYou and I know is that teachers are a huge part of their past and their future and so it it has made things very easy for us\nUm and it's also been great because we've had a lot of really positive feedback and and teachers and educators saying that this is awesome and this is a very cool that we wanted to do this and\nTo us it it uh it's been a big project but it was more so just us wanting to show appreciation and they they know that and they're feeling that that's exactly what we want it all out of all of this we have started to build a very good relationship with our education department and\nWe've realized how well [noise] um we've placed are teachers and our our student teachers and how well\nYou know based on the fact that to the leave northern Iowa are getting jobs in the teaching field and so what we feel confident about is that\nThis is going to be something that will continue to grow and when we start to get these teachers that are branching out a little bit that this initiative will\nStart to gain traction outside of Iowa and um we are very excited about that possibility ten years down the road\nUm where do we know that our education department has a very good connection with their alarms um we just want to make sure that people understand that um we really just want to show appreciation and and elevate that a department and in that area of of of a profession\nI'm In our goal is is again like I mentioned just to continue this for\nHowever long or you know northern Iowa exists in it and it'll be forever and so for us it's um how can we make sure that they feel loved and appreciated and come back to campus for a game and and really just enjoy game day\nAnd again it's it's it's all about them and we just want them to to understand that um we know where our passes in where we want our future to be in and they're going to always be a part of it\nIt's always nice to be recognized of course in teachers don't often get that from their students but for a select few in this program elevating educators that recognition will come\nWe've named um three educators of the game so far this season for football\nAnd all and end all three of them were absolutely honored to have that uh um to be named educator the game they were very happy to be recognized for their hard work and I think that's also teachers sometimes they don't have that type of recognition at times and so for us just to\nTo pick one individual out and bring them back to the game and and recognize them as a big deal in the registration um that we've received for the elevating educators game lot of positive ... a lot of comments that are saying this is\nVery often to see we we are appreciating that ah you took the time out to recognize us and ultimately that's exactly what we want we want people to to under ...\nWe we are appreciating that ah you took the time out to recognize us and ultimately that's exactly what we want we want people to to understand that we're working for them in and want them to have a great day we will be recognizing the individual at every men's basketball game as well\nAnd so it it's just been a good um it's a good start for us we we know where it's going to go but it's been a great start\nOur these awards the educator of the game shows\nWe have a a group of individuals on campus in the education department that are kind of compiling some some nominations essentially\nThey're the best to pack them because they understand that field they know what it takes they know\nUm they have the connections you know they know um where people have been in in the track that people have gotten to 'em and so it's it's good for us because that's not our world and so it's been good for a for them to kind of take rain on that\nAnd we know that it's done well because they have a high standard just like University of northern Iowa does when it comes to educators\nUm and it's the exact same thing with our scared of the game and it's it's been a really good way to start the season for more information um everything's on our website right now\nAre you not Panthers dot com slash elevating educators um and be on the lookout we are going to be selecting a men's and women's basketball date as well um to recognize a educators as well just like this November seventeenth game and so\nKeep an eye out we we should be announcing that fairly soon [noise]\n\nWhere you at I campus spotlight I'm Mark

years and ah ran for supervisor wanted and then got be the next\nFour years later and ran again and on and I'm a supervisor for the past twelve years and love what I'm doing [noise]\nTwelve years that's a that's a good long time you had lots of experience now so ... what would you uh you know listen to some of your most memorable accomplishments the things you're proudest of\nThe things I'm most proud of is the uh the way the board gets along and some people say well it's because it's an all democratic word well\nI don't care if you're a Democrat Republican what you are sometimes here there is a clashes with anything but uh we agree to disagree on a lot of things and we've got a the board that's in place now\nWith some some great leadership from each one has their expertise we've accomplished a lot over the past twelve years my most proud thing is the roads and bridges the amount of roads and bridges ... re repaired over the past twelve years\nA engineer I think she quoted one time and saying we've done more in the past twelve years than we did the past twenty five thirty years so\nIt makes me proud to know that we got some good roads and bridges out there and and I said in the middle of the health board and um\n[noise] uh that's my biggest concern right now that's why I wanted to serve it one more term to try and uh stay on pat we had a meeting a Wednesday and fertile and forcing them as a board members were they're out of the twenty two\nAnd six of us are are up for reelection and one's not running again so that can be a big turnover on that board for a mental health\nAnd uh I'm afraid to that or you don't have some good leadership in there what could happen and you're what you're talking about is the regional ... right right right\nI'm afraid to if you don't have some good leadership in there what could happen\nAnd you're what you're talking about is the regional ... right right right that's the state has broken up night a region\nOkay [noise] um\nThere's been some controversy well first of all I guess get to get back to what you said about roads and bridges that that work is not is not cheap I mean that's expensive works but the state has helped some ... yeah the last few years the racing together reaching the Ghana next right yep\nYep that's how quite a bit but uh like we said we'd been fiscally responsible with their money and we've got a\nLot of done as far as I'm concerned a lot of roads and bridges done with for a good good bang for the buck mhm smart you'd like to get done and then ... yeah lots lots more yup\nA big once no no not right off the well we've got a bridge and I can't remember which one it is right outside of my head but and we're just finishing up one over by ventured a um that's really nice to to get that when we're done it's a big ... big bridge that is going to serve the people well now\nFor another hundred years probably so I won't be around to see the end of that loan [laughter]\nI don't plan on staying around that long but\nThere has been some controversy and quite a bit of it has come just lately with the which country you're going to care center they are staying home and mental health care center as it turned out to be as well right ah take us through that process and how you feel about the way it has gone\nBut it's been a long drawn out process I'm I'm happy with where we're at right now uh I'm sad to see it you know changed hands but unfortunately uh even the people that are on the opposite side of the Iowa that come up and talk to me and say that they're\nThey're happy to see that we're or selling it because it's not a business economy should be and\nAnd my feelings on it are over the past Twenty years that I I've been going out there are even more than twenty or some of the ... lost a lot of good friends that lived out there that call them my friends there you know that some of them are severely handicapped but they're still human beings and we've taking good care of them\nAnd the outfit that we've ah we've done some lot of research on it's been a lot of hours checking them out and they they're they look like a good there'll be a good neighbor for us here you know with the taken over the business\nIf you had to come down on the price\nWrite write quite a bit as ... yep so why was that uh because of the cuts to mental health and the different things and and\nUm I'm trying to remember what else was involved in it um it's just a matter of a well in a ... they're not they're\nNot getting as much money as ... we're not getting as much money from the state as we used to and ah\nThat'll change a little bit for them because there are there ... if you're a bigger player it's easier to get the money I feel that's just my thoughts and we're not a big player really you know there's only two of a slap to us in the view and a\n... that's an I think I\nDon't quote me on is what I'm pretty sure that we're going to follow suit I think their next in line to um last time ... one of us to talk to them they were looking at me and if our cell went well they were going to sell theirs\n[noise] okay so they're they're leveled out her yeah All right um\nWhat kind of guarantees are there in terms of all let's look at it from the patience or residence if you will point of view what kind of guarantees are there as far as as far as they're concerned as far as the employees are concerned\nAh ... the patients are clients are out there will there there'll be taken care of\nAh the things we put in place for them is a there'll be um ten years at least ten years though but uh they've got to be taken care of their ... it'll be more than that because I'm\nTalking with pretty chalked people they're they're pretty set on the you know the procedure we got there are going to change a few things but the people that are there will be able to stay in a lot of people were worried about that no one's going to be kicked out\nThey might come up and say you know the only one at three in this area and were we'd like to look at something else for it and ask if there was alternatives that they might consider and if they say no there'll there'll be entitled to stay\nFor employees we put some safety net a deals in place for them for a a\nYear ... there I forget what the percentage is ... ... and right now I'd say anybody that wants to stay when Winfrey talked takes over we'll get to stay because they are going to need the people to keep operating in reality\nIt is harder these days defined right employees ... times because the uh the talents that are needed or I'm a little more specialized and they you know day by day realistically legally they'll have to re apply for a job right at twelve\nTwelve o'clock at well this is a not set in stone yet but on the thirty first of December which is we're looking at the closing date at twelve o'clock midnight or lay I'm often at twelve all one they'll be hired by pre talk\nSo there'll be a continuation on out there so\nAnd us a few of them have a voice their opinions and I understand where they're coming from you know change is always hard but we tried to ... do the best we could for all the employees to for the employees and the patients out there and I think we've done a good job of it if some if somebody thinks different they can always call me and we can talk\nThe country do you issue of course is is the most recent there must have been some other uh difficult decisions you had to make over the past or over the past twelve years get any come to mind\nNo not right off the top I just see but uh I had one of the guys for honor flight the other morning when the guys come up to me he goes why do you what do you think about a four wheelers uh\nVehicles on the side streets in the city I go I don't think too highly of it he I go because this is the way the bicycles don't you don't pay attention to the stop signs and stuff I go at worries me we could ask them you know real serious injuries with that and he goes\nA way way down not real happy with that answer I go well I'm Sorry I said I'm your friend but you know I'm going to tell you the truth you know that then a guy standing right next to me he goes you know you guys got a tough job I've got to make some tough decisions I go that I like what I'm doing I enjoy what I'm doing and I think I Do a good job of it\nAll right well I'm a voter and uh I'll be going to the polling place on the sixth of November like everyone else if I Do choose to vote absentee ahead of time which my wife has done a why should I say why do you write white ...\nWhite cares about Black Hawk county I've I've never moved away from here I went to like I said when the service come back and I'm ... I'm I'm highly involved in the community to it which I'm sure everyone knows that you know and I just don't do it for the publicity I Do it because they care about people\nMy thoughts were when I come home and uh the buddies loss in Vietnam I'm ... I'm Carrying forward for them or paying it forward for them because they didn't have the opportunity and I said that to somebody on the honor flight the other night they go uh what do you do this stuff I ... and I said that same thing and they go that's kind of neat\nYeah and I said that to somebody on the ... the other night they go oh what do you do this stuff and I said that same thing and they go that's kind of neat now go yeah and I said but the way I look at it but if I was one of them that was on the wall\nDavis are hard to talk of one of the other forty five names over there would be carrying the ... torch forward for me All right Greg white otherwise\nKnown as white even most of his uh acquaintances\nUh thanks for coming in appreciate it thank you very much good luck\nCan't sales mark Morris with Craig White Democrat incumbent running for another term on the black hawk county board of supervisors once again two seats on the ballot on November six next Tuesday\nTwo seats three candidates yesterday you heard from Republican Dan trunk today incumbent Democrat Greg white tomorrow mark Morris is a trio of interviews concludes\nDemocrat yes she a baby will join mark at this time tomorrow here on the voice of Easter Island news talk Fifteen forty ... business news in less than sixty seconds\nAnd so I think that there is sort of an element to fund their\nFor sure but I also think that you have friends never really went away it's certainly more popular to talk about now and it's more accessible because of Netflix and things like that\nBut it was always there in the background and people you know it's not in syndication for almost twenty five years now um and I think it really resonates still because ultimately at its core it's not about those you know very specific timely elements about something that's very timeless which is the experience of friendship\nAnd that is something that is almost universal and does not it's not take any particular decade or any particular generation it's it's something that everybody can relate to or every let something everybody wants for them themselves you know\nAnd I think that last point is is really interesting it's something everyone wants to because if you try to go to a coffee shop today even was a group of a half dozen people who were there together\nChances are they're all going to be looking at their phones are not talking to one another so there is a void there of actual communication and friendship\nYeah yeah no I think that that is definitely something that's your that's something from the past that I think was simpler and I think and arguably a little bit better I mean even the fact that people talk to each other on the phone or something [laughter] that seems so alien now you know\nWell it does because again we we we touch someone sitting across the room for almost as opposed to actually look up and having the conversation what's been the reaction to this book either among those of us who are a little older who remember the first time or folks of your generation\nIt's so wonderful because I think\nOkay so this show we know that it reached a massive audience we know that pretty much everybody even if they didn't watch it they have sort of a relationship to it and everybody at all the responses that I've gotten that far like oh I thought that I was the only one who felt this way about the show where you really you really sort of captured the way that I feel when I watched that show\nUm and and I think I I really enjoy that I'm really glad to hear that people connected with it on a on a very personal level because I think the the shell\nReached people on a personal level what did they know they're not going to people think that they're just turning on something sort of mindless but it really is hitting you know a soft spot in our hearts when we're watching the show like this\nWhat surprised even knew because again this was something that you had written about but then when it came time to do something a whole book length treatment that's a lot more research what are some things that surprised you\nSome things that surprised me look I think you know a lot of the stories about the casting were really surprising because it really made me realize just how close this show came to\nWell not happening and certainly to having different cast members when you think about it there's you know six different main characters and any one of them really could have been cast\nYou know it could have been played by somebody else and it would have totally totally changed the chemistry of the show and who knows if it would have been you know as good or if it would've lasted as long it really felt sort of like a series of tiny miracles that made friends come out the way it did\nThe information I have says that you were a whopping ten years of age when the show first came on the air and so for those who are a little older are a lot older than that uh we went looking to be like oh\nSo first came on the air and so forth with some of those who are a little older are a lot older than that uh we would look it'd be like oh to be cool if there was a coffee shop like this while you're watching this during your formative years and so it goes off the air as you're a young adult\nDo you think that that was going to be or did you unconsciously patterns things after it like oh we should all go to the coffee shop or we should do this because somehow in your mind the the people on friends did it and that's what made it the way to go\nYeah totally and I think that's that's true for almost everybody I think that you even for people who didn't watch the show because friends\nReally did play a role in amplifying that coffee culture it came out almost around the exact same time that\nUh that Starbucks came out and both of them became like super popular\nAt right at the same moment and that coffee shop culture became a thing just as friends with with sort of rising to become the most popular show on television and I definitely think that that\nInfluence to me I mean I'll be honest I got that Rachel hair cut at least two or three times before I realized it was not going to work for me [laughter]\nAnd I have I have yet to meet a woman who didn't at least want to get at\nUm so I think yeah it definitely it definitely had an impact and some of the things like the Rachel I knew I was not only after the show other things it didn't really click until later when I was when I was researching this book like oh yeah that was the friend thing\nNow not all the things on the program were perfect and and when we want shows now on some of these nostalgic channels run Netflix whether it's friends or ones that are a little older\nYou know sometimes I sort of wins because I think wow I Can't believe that they said that at that time because it's just a sensor Simpsons today did show suffer from much of that\n[noise] yeah uh yeah it definitely did um and I think we notice that a lot more than ... simply because friends is everywhere and friends is so popular and we all know it's so while\nI'm certainly it's a product that at the time but that time was a lot less inclusive and you know had a lot more than ... opened socially accepted bigotry\nUh and so you find a lot of things like you know they said there's that sort of glaring lack of diversity on the show there's a lot of really casual asserted lazy gay jokes and um [noise]\nYou know there's a there's a lot I mean even the dynamics between men and women now seem like pretty you know uncomfortable because it it you know the ... Ross measles relationship as much as they lead that they were not a great couple and the beginning he was very jealous he didn't like that you had a career she was pursuing and\nUm you know thankfully I think by the time they got together at the end everybody had grown up a little bit and grown out of that behavior but I think it's definitely you know where the where he has examination when were you know looking at something that it's so massively popular to say like okay this is so massively popular\nAnd everybody's watching it and you know let's just think about the message is putting in our heads\nAnd I think that's a great point because when I see some of these things\nThey didn't strike me at the time but they do now with the passage of time and and it's a good thing too I I don't like it when they they edit those sorts of things out because I think we need to see it because it leads to discussions whether it's within ourselves or with someone else about what is appropriate in society\nOh yeah I hundred percent agree with you I think that yeah I I I don't think that re editing it is a good idea at all I think it's worthy and just like saying hey you know this is a good show in a good enjoyable show but you know it's also something that we can use that has a historical marker and and look and look back and examine at in that way as well\n... thanks so much for taking the time and for putting this altogether a great subject and do we encourage everybody to take a look at the book thank you so much [noise]\nSkills the Miller the author of a new book released just last Wednesday called all be there for you for one about friends tells the Miller dot com for more information\nAverage named the book anything other than that but\nThey actually only seven hours three forty seven all take a look inside the Iowa almanac in sixty seconds on news talk this scene forty a actually young ladies\nAnd gentlemen I have a brave enough to make incredible as if I see those strange being so landed on the Jersey farmlands delight or the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars Mars or\nBought October thirtieth in Tempe just to take them\nOut on the coming out\nNow eighty years later [noise]\nNews talk to the morning till you resent the iconic mercury radio will be in a production of the war of the world's tonight from six enjoy worse than welded leaving to radio legend modernization that can bring nervous America was being invaded by glaciers are\nThat my mom and mom or your friends or what not to ... do you want to join in India better monitoring of the war the war on the movies or not I was talking to the forty ...\nBegging door to door more from the Iowa almanac moment\nSee I was secretary of state's office once you to be voter ready for the November ... election it's easy register to vote bringing her ID or signing oaths of identity and cast your ballot register prepare vote for more information visit voter ready Iowa dot org\nIn the Nineteen thirties Halloween in Des Moines was focused more on vandalism band going door to door for treats Elise there responded to a record five hundred fifty calls the vandalism in one year alone\nThe director of what is now the parks and rec department Catherine Craig came up with a campaign to encourage less destructive forms of fun", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "30"}
