like a warm fire on a daily dang Hi I'm Jody banking that would you ... how hot it again and how long it lasts as you're living in the country like\nIn the country like ideas an inspiration for your

newsstands or online at the merits of the word dot com under living the country life\n\nYou currently are employed by the county attorney's office I Am what ... what are your duty as a ... and ... is there\nUm so I Am responsible for the a serious an aggravated misdemeanors the anti doubles and a ... that's just my docket so I work on um cases that come to me that are assigned to me\nIn foresee any potential conflict of interest not necessarily but I actually but do you foresee any potential conflicts of interest between working for the county and and ah I guess governing the county as it were\nI'm Phil from my understanding and working with my boss at this point in time there is no conflict if there is anything specifically addressing the county attorney's office than I Would need to recuse myself from it but um for the most part um there is no conflict of interest\nAll right well you've had a lot of time in this area to observe the county board of what has been your observation about the job they've been doing and what would you like to do if elected\nI think uh the ... is\nThey're very United um even in terms of having the goal of working together to get things done 'em and what I like about the current board is even though they all have their different positions or their main goal is to serve the people of the county and I think they're doing that very well\nAnd so when its position um when I understood that I'm Frank wasn't going to seek reelection I thought this would be a great time to join 'em and then off from my perspective um for me for the last eight years and I was in DC\nI had the opportunity to work under President Obama but at the U.S department of agriculture under Secretary Vilsack\nAnd part of that time when I was there I was working with counties across the country and specifically um they'll sac had um this goal of eradicating\nThey'll say and part of that time when I was there I was working with counties across the country and specifically I'm Bill sac had um this goal of eradicating are helping combat persistent poverty rural counties across America\nAnd so I Would have to help lead that project and so my experience of working with counties I'm and seeing the great scope that they have and what they can do to really make their counties grow and\nUm and just be more vibrant for the residents inside I thought I can bring some of those skills that I learned there working again with counties across the country right here back home\n... can you get a little more specific in terms of what a what a county supervisor at a county board of supervisors is a a allowed to do under strict code\n[noise] yeah so the main part I think of um what they're supposed to do is they are responsible for the budget um and then um they are also responsible for the Human Services that go on I'm In the county so and and that's the basic part I think um what is what the county coats that but\nI think where we can take the county supervisor real is being a partner\nUm and leveraging what the county services can do\nAnd as the um at the leader of the county I'm just I'm I think be a stronger partner with ... weather also is with us or counties to make the region a little bit more attractive so we can attract in a new uh companies a more diverse um\nEntities that come into really a boost our economy here\n[noise] so you're talking about economic development which is something that one or the other candidates are referred to in my interview with him\nUm how would that play out is in your mind as far as the you know as far as the county in the city's obviously black hotel he's mostly most of the people live and municipalities whether it's a water heater falls or the smaller cities around\nThe Bush ... for the rural county but there is um and that means generally a lot of a lot more open land or how would you do that to economic development effort playing out in the county level\nWell I think where you don't have the municipalities are really responsible for the economic development but with a county can come in is\nTrying to find out where those gaps are in sort of be a bridge so um there are grants there are funding opportunities out there that counties can apply for 'em and to see where we can be that bridge builder sometimes just having a leadership at the table as attractive\nOr to bring in whether it's new businesses whether it's a more people um just showing how to increase the tax base and sometimes having that United front\nIs all that's needed now I can say that because when I worked um at USDA when we went to these counties there were some things that these counties just could not do\nBut because they were seated at the table and when we have private partners come in and other entities looking to make investments when they saw all leadership there were sitting at the table showing you a United front stating that this is the direction we want our county to go\nUm people were more inclined to be drawn to the toward they'll count ...\n... with the point I'm\nA recent decision by the county board which are stretched out over a few years but it had to do with the eventual sales of a review appear shuttered or the Waterloo\nVery controversial decision or black or Cody had been one of only two remaining county owned and operated nursing homes in Iowa\nOr give me your perspective from a distance as to how they handle that and uh did they make the right decision\nWell I Hope so let's break this down until a couple of pieces your um yes it was one of the only to Dubuque being the other one to have um a a facility like that here\nI thought it was good because it met the needs of so many people that were out there those families depended on\nCountry view and then also being a good employer um you have a lot of great skilled people that are out there that worked very hard\nAnd um it's a good employer so I hate 'em that it had to go in and had to be sold 'em but do I think that's a board made the right decision I think based on what they knew what and what they're doing\nUm that's a decision they would have made ... I don't know if I Would have necessarily made the same decision but at the same time\nUm I wasn't part of the entire process I think I Would have done things differently and I can go back on talking about\nUm when we talked about budget um I've been responsible for budget says um high as the two point nine billion dollars up to seven point nine billion dollars and we were running operations where we weren't getting cut from Congress\nAnd so when you take a look at things um sometimes you have to make certain cuts and you have to do leveraging certain programs\nBut you highlight what is important to you and how do you want to move forward and I think I'm In my experience um I don't know how I Would have been able to participate in that process but I Would have liked to see it on board\nBut now since it's being sold I think the transition um I Know some people are concerned I'm Talking about\nUh their retirement um will they um [noise] be able to unionize or where they'd be able to um protect our jobs in are the people that are being um service by country view what they still be able to receive those services\nSo there's still a lot of unknowns in I've that's fair um but I think the way that the board has handled it up to this point has ah been very open very transparent and that's all we can ask for our government to do\nRight\nWe're running short on time so I Will ask you as a taxpayer at a voter um when I go into the are going to the littler books there why should I get a\nCheck yesterday above it\nWell I think you should check yes you have and I hope you do but uh as I stated before it not only do I have experienced in terms of working with counties\nI have the budget experience so again I've managed budget doubled my lowest budget was two point nine billion dollars um when I was at USDA I finished my tenure there as a deputy assistant secretary for administration there I was responsible for\nUm operation such a homeland security and emergency coordination I was responsible for information technology and not just the computers themselves but the networks to keep our government safe [noise]\nI'm In addition to that I was responsible for property for chairman so anytime USDA least facilities purchase sold a weather ... fleets of vehicles air tankers that fell under my purview and in addition to that um executive correspondence\nAnd just the basic operations and that affected over Ninety thousand employees\nSo I have that experience and I think if you just take a look at my history of\nUm being able to get things done\nA being a change maker and also being someone who likes to bridge gaps and work together I think I bring a unique perspective to the county board of supervisors and again our campaign has always believed that um\nIt got there I think I bring a unique perspective to the county board of supervisors and again our campaign is always believed that um everyone in Black Hawk county should be able to laugh and pursue their dreams right here in Black Hawk county\nAnd we can only do that so long as everybody has a seat at the table and that's what our campaign and how it's been about not being inclusive\nNot just watermelons thought because that's where the bulk of the people are but we've been out knocking doors in rural Black Hawk down within our dumping Gilbert them and so we understand that this is a county position and we look forward to serving everybody here\nYes she thanks I appreciate the time make you very much like Kay actually yells mark Morris with us she may be Democrats for Black Hawk county supervisor you've now hurting successive days from all three of the candidates to sponsor available election day of course just next Tuesday\nTo Senator Chuck Grassley with a message about my friend Ron Ron\nRogers around you and your family that's why I Am can count on Ron blown\nNow I don't know this for a fact but I heard Nat King Cole performed in some smaller\nAh venues when he was just starting out I Do know he performed in Cedar Rapids several times in a couple a cozy restaurant type events\nUh and I did hear that he came to Waterloo but I've never been able to confirm that Johnny Cash which here several times Johnny Cash I actually have a beautiful replica of a poster of performing macaroni auditorium\nAnd then I've heard that Glenn Miller performed here with his band and of course he's from Iowa to run but I was yes but I haven't been able to confirm that so maybe some your listeners can call in and and let you know or I Love it if they would email on me on my website\nAnd give me some information if in fact they know that Nat King Cole or Glenn Miller ever performed here\nMike ... Chapman dot com is the website there's a contact link right there there was a real circuit\nDuring that time they play the ... theater in Des Moines they'd come up to one of the Venus here whether it was what is now McIlroy auditorium or the electric park all room there were a lot of these stops that the performers were would make it and they would be on the road\nYou know the winner dance party with buddy Holly I mean I as I recall\nIt was supposed to be clear lake to sue city and I think Waterloo was supposed to be one of the stops later on then Des Moines I mean they were just all over barn storming through and so even big names like Johnny Cash would rabble by bus from one point in Iowa to another and Waterloo was one of those points\nYeah serve two purposes of course they would get out and they make good money by performing but it also promoted their record sales so it was a double edged sword in in that regard and like you said almost all of them did a chubby checker fats domino didn't like to travel but he would do it from time to time\nA Chuck Berry I saw him in person down in your neck of the woods down in a team of Fifteen Years ago or ... yeah yeah he was still a tremendous performer Chuck Berry [noise]\nAnd you know Waterloo has has\nHad some of its own citizens go onto relative recognition and same in the music world to a\nLot of your listeners will know the name Bonnie ... she when she was born and raised in Waterloo and uh lived here for many years I was a student at the University of northern Iowa for a while\nI'm majoring in drama and then moved on Chicago where she became really an iconic figure\nIn folk singing circles in Chicago she never really had that huge breakthrough hit like um coal miners daughter or something but very highly respected uh by her peers in the music world ... from Waterloo\nAnd a lot of what she did was folk music and so that didn't lend itself to break out yet but it led to devoted following and as you pointed out to me performing with the likes that Steve Goodman and John Brian I mean a well known by aficionados of that music Sondra\nWell it was they were called the trinity of the Chicago folk scene Steve Goodman John Prine and Bonnie cool lock and I'll tell you when I was growing up uh she was a ... she was a big name in the Waterloo area and of course just recently much more recently in twenty fourteen Emily ...\nAnd of course just recently much more recently in twenty fourteen Emily West made national news when she competed in the ninth season of America's got talent and when all the way to the finals finishing second\nAnd a ... her real name is Emily Murray numbers\nAnd uh her parents of course were native of Waterloo and her uncle is one of my best friend's Larry but art and we were classmates in east tie in Larry and told me about Emily for many years and\nHow great a performer she was and she was in Nashville in really doing well but she really hit the big time when she was on America's got talent\nAnd she'd been very busy since then and she traveled with Jay Leno for a while she was an opening act for him after she was on America's got down so [noise]\nSo there's two pretty big names Emily western Bonnie ... that came right out of Waterloo\nAnd not all that long ago and that's one of the important things we like to talk about history but history is being\nMade every day it is in and let me also mention too that when I was in junior high a big name banned all around Iowa was Eddie Randall and the down beats and once again you have to have been raised in the Waterloo area and listen to their music\nThey had a couple of top twenty hits nationally but any Randall the down beach were very very prominent in this area and so it was a a piano ragtime performer by the name of George Clark who went to east Waterloo\nIn both Eddie Randall and his band and George ... in the Iowa rock and Roll Hall of fame so those were pretty big names in the ... area\nThis is what are the
