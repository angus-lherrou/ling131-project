of course those are major population centers going in everybody in those markets I Would think it was gonna say well I'd rather take my chances with two or three than I Am not a one game so I think that did skew the numbers\nTo me it is different and and I am a casual sports fan I probably favor baseball more than professional football but it's such an odd thing in football\nYou've got a week to prepare for that initial round of games and the NC double a tournament you got nearly a week before the first games and so you've got a longer build up before a potential let down after a loss here

two of them are turning around for Tuesday for another game baseball's different a in a one of the great things I'm a I'm more of a baseball fan than anything else as well one of the great things is that that\nYou know during the regular season other than the all star break or if it rains you don't get two days off right it's got to it at every twenty days you get a day off and then it's back to war mhm I'm In here and here it's the same I Would guess you know lots of teams would prefer to have three four days off some will\nGet your pitching staff organized cetera but um there is something exciting about season and Sunday let's go play Monday and\nSome will get your pitching staff organized cetera but um there is something exciting about season and Sunday let's go play Monday and and then let's go play every day you know it's as a fad watch better than that\nWhen you've had a lot of drama Sunday Monday Tuesday of this week in the national league for sure as you note I'm interested in this because we pay a lot of attention and I were to political polling for reasons that are obvious to you went to the audience what has changed in terms of sampling in an era\nOf fewer landline phones and people who have devices in the palm of their hand with phone numbers that may there no relationship to where they are geographically what's different\nWell ... that is what's different it used to be you could you could basically kept on doing a hard line telephone pole 'em and get you know the the estimates where if you got one out of every twelve calls you've made if you've got somebody that to you know to\nTo do the poll that was pretty good\nUh it's still the same with hard lines but but um if you're only doing a hard line pole you're missing out on many too many people who who simply don't either don't have hard lines or don't pay any attention to them anymore you donate to go the cell phones\nAnd it used to be demographic based wasn't it that if you did a hard line only poll you would skew older\nOr yet it still is actually yeah it's not just older you skew older and female really um yeah the the the er and I couldn't do that you know when I started doing this poll as I said I guess two thousand and six\nUm we we found you know the the the experts the sampling experts taught me that when you have to ask when somebody answers the phone because generally speaking it's an older woman answering the mother in ... in the home answers the phone\nUm you have to ask for the you know for the old the un available male who's over Eighteen years old just\nJust see get a good sampling\nI'm so yeah and that's still the case um but now excuse even older obviously you're younger people are most young people are using cell phones so so we were just about fifty percent now I'd say ... probably forty five percent sell and ah I'm fifty five percent hard line\nAnd it's easy to get the hard line because you go by an area code which is ... how do you get the cell phone folk so that you know you have the geographic balance or does that matter\nDoes matter and it's the same the same concept where you get 'em if you're looking to get cell phone numbers that are that have a you know an area code that that represents an area but a ... a section of the country but um\nYou know I live in Pennsylvania now I have a nine one seven area code on my on my cell phone which is in New York area code so you know that's where it's off\nUm it's it's probably a little less scientific\nThen um\nYou know than it used to be what you'd call and hard lines 'cause you're literally know exactly what phone was ringing it's an adjustment\nIt's not as scientific to do it online for instance where I Would say okay I'm doing the Seton hall sports fall\nIf you want to participate go you know jump on in here you have already skewed your audience you've already got people who are interested in sports for instance and and when you do have a phone poll it you're not I'm not ever going to say the risk of our interviewers never say would you like to take a poll on sports\nBecause people who are interested in sports they know and they're gone\nYou know you you want to say it's on current events and then we'll hit him with the sports questions um nothing deceptive here it's just that you don't want the audience they the the respondents to sort of pre screened your poll\nThat's an interesting thought there were a couple of other questions of note with regard to baseball give us a sense of what else the polls show this year\nWell we asked that question again that we've asked often in the past about about big market teams in small market teams you know baseball has has taken great pains to try to achieve a degree of parity where where everybody has a chance with the luxury tax and all that but if you look at it\nAnd and and ... if you look at it over the years the same big market teams seemed to continue to sink to repeat the Yankees Red Sox the Dodgers I'm ... and and the and the lately of course the cubs\nBut I'm the question is in baseball you know you'll get a Milwaukee you'll you'll get a Cleveland and every year there was a small market team that kind of snakes in but there's a lot of teams involved so my question is always\nYou know it do you think that big market teams have an advantage and\nFifty seven percent of our of our spawn and so the big market teams have an advantage over the small small market teams and getting to the postseason Thirteen percent said that they do not have an advantage so you know that's that's really big number\nAnd the poll gives us a number do you have some suspicion as to why is it because of money or fame or free agents only want to go to the bright lights or what\nI think it's all the above you know you know I say you take it all the Jane Carlos stat and I'm I'm Free agency last season where teams even ... market I I sit with the giants have made a big offer and they you know ... heart after him and offered the same kind of money and he basically said\nI don't want to go there and I I kinda the Yankees I'd rather be in New York that's where the action is you know it's a good homerun stadium so there's a lot of factors but the truth is that they do seem to gravitate to\nYou know the Yankees Red Sox seem to be in the running for every major for and now the Dodgers of course ... seem to be in the running for every major free agents and that that has an impact\nWhen you've got a national game like baseball that everybody plays from the start and then you get the folks running MLD who think well we have consultants who say it needs to move more quickly or we need to change this or we need to do that\nDoes that really have much impact to do the fans really think that some of these tweets to the game they've known from in essence of the time they were born is that really make much difference to them\nWell we asked we asked them whether um\nThe the recent rules changes including reduced mound visits cetera\nHave had an effect on on the pace of play 'em\nTwenty three percent said yes and Twenty one percent said no and fifty five percent said they didn't have an opinion um I mean what what would you say my response of somebody asked me that question would say no I don't notice any difference I noticed that that there's most strike outs than hits I noticed that\nUm I noticed that I don't really care about launching gold but I'm I'm beating over the head with it every game I noticed that [laughter] but I but I don't notice that the gangs moving any quicker you know when I see when I see I'm leaving last night I think there were like Fifteen\nI noticed that [laughter] but\nBut I don't notice that the gangs moving any quicker you know when I see when I see 'em leave it last night I think they were like Fifteen strike outs and the first five innings you know total or ... you know it's it's it really is it\nThat to me is this is a big factor more so than how many times the pitching coach goes after the amount or the catcher\nBut when it comes down to a cubs fans today say if only we would have had a two out of three and will never be able to prove them wrong\nThat's true and that's you know look it's ... I think even the even the powers that be a baseball I don't think there's anybody who thinks that a one game playoff is better I shouldn't say that there are people who think\nLet's just do it you know let's just get out there and play the game and you know and like last night was a great example unbelievable game ebb and flow you know how how does it get better than that well my response would\nLiving the country live ideas an inspiration for your place in the country you can find more information on today's topic share your tips and post photos by visiting us online at leaving the country life dot com\nTaxi alive and local continues on the fifty thousand one voice of eastern Iowa news talk Fifteen forty ... hello I'm Jeff Stein It's Wednesday afternoon and that means I'm joined in the studio by author and historian Waterloo native Mike Chapman\nI Want you to tell us today and you've shared it in some respects before but it's a story that everybody should hear\nAs often as we can tell it tell us the story of red Becker because not only in my mind is that an incredible story about how it was last for generations until you yourself founded and brought it back but let's hear about it\nWell thanks a Jeff that's a great introduction and Fred Becker is as he wrote the figures Waterloo was ever produced [noise] he was a great student a growing up at east Hi\nHis family lived on ... street and the home is still there I Believe at least the address is still there\nAnd when I was coming to town to look into finding a spot for the day in Gable museum when we moved it from Newton or my wife Beverly and I had created it and we decided after ten years our board of directors to move to a museum to Waterloo\nI was driving around town in a room ... mood and I graduated from east Waterloo in Nineteen sixty one\nAnd I'm driving by that magnificent structure and I get out and I walk up to the very front of it\nAnd I notice a plaque there\nRye for the flagpole isn't the flag is blowing in the wind and I read the plaque says in memory of our classmates who lost their lives in World War one and the first name is lieutenant Fred Becker class of Nineteen fourteen\nKilled July Eighteen Nineteen Eighteen on the western front\nSo we're coming up on the centennial\nOf when he literally gave his life exactly\nJeff were just two months away from the hundred year anniversary of that tragic day [noise]\nAnd so I started to do some research on Fred because being the former sports are the Cedar Rapids Gazette and heavily involved in the history of the University of ... I knew the very first all American football player was named Fred Becker\nBut I never had any idea where he was from so I started doing some research and I said to myself and some friends it couldn't possibly be the same for back or how could we have all attended east Waterloo and I talked to some of my friends who I played football there and ... one of my best friends played football there\nAnd we talk to nobody had ever heard of Fred Becker\nSo I started to do some research and found out Jeff that this was the very same Fred Becker that became the very first all American football player in the history of the University of Iowa now a little background he was a standout student at least Waterloo he was an all state football player\nHe was a varsity basketball player he was a class officer as a junior and senior he was involved in all kinds of extracurricular activities and irony of ironies he was even a an officer in the German club and the name backers German\nAnd of course he would eventually lose his life fighting against Germans\nSo I started to do further research and found out that in Nineteen sixteen as a sophomore he may first team all American at Iowa as on line one\nFor further research and found out that in Nineteen sixteen as a sophomore he may first team all American at Iowa as a line when\nHe signed up to fight in World War one he wasn't drafted you know remember as a glamorous war Beverly and I just watched the incredible movie the war horse just recently about World War one and trench warfare and a lot of young Europeans and Americans thought this was going to be a glamorous short lived battle [noise]\nWell they found out it was entirely different as you know as the first war where they used machine guns where they use flame throwers or they were used barb wire fencing and where they used to mustard gas and it turned into the horrific experience\nAnd Fred lost his life flight Eighteenth Nineteen Eighteen as a marine lieutenant officer on the infamous western front briefly\nA the records I found out he\nWas charging up a hill leading his platoon and he took on a German machine gun nest and is credited with saving the lives of many of his men shortly after he was shot and killed and died on the very spot\nThe body laid there for three years and then when the war was over his his body has remains were brought back to Waterloo\nA huge crowd gathered at the train station to see the casket arrive\nAnd when he was buried in fairly cemetery five thousand people went to the ceremony Jeff\nThat the courier said it was the largest gathering in Waterloo history at that point so Fred Becker a I found out of the American legion post his name Becker Chapman post and of course my name's Chapman and I'm no relation but that was Carl Chapman and he was a very good athlete at West Waterloo and\nHe lost his life uh flying overseas in Europe now Fred Becker was awarded the distinguished service cross he was also awarded the French Quarter ... and the Belgian more cross for bravery he may be the most decorated soldier in Waterloo history and uh\nI I ... I put him on the cover of my magazine Iowa history journal which you've written for before and then I wrote a book called triumphant tragedy they're inspiring stories of for football legends\nFred Becker jak Trice Nile Kenny who also lost his life in World War two and Johnny Bright of Drake University a friend of yours and mine gyms ... wrote the forward in an incredible forward and let me read this little portion of it\nMight Chapman has taken for iconic figures from our past and brought them back to life walking talking breathing human beings competing with full emotion through the pages of this book they all had one thing in common they gave so much of themselves that they finally gave their lives gyms awful [noise]\nSo the University of Iowa ... read my story on Fred backer and Phil how did the sports information director called me up and he said can we reprint that in the Iowa football program for an upcoming game and I said I Would be delighted\nSo they did then less dean leech a they're so should athletic director since retired called me up about eight months later and said you know Mike we looked on our list and Fred Becker has been on our list to be inducted\nInto the ILO athletic hall of fame for like Fifteen Years and he never gets any votes because nobody knows anything about him\nSo I took the liberty in our last about to send out your story on him\nWe had our meeting last night he got every single vote he's going in unanimously then they called me up about six months later and said you know Mike\n[noise] we can't find any living relatives\nOr his mother and father of long since passed away he had two sisters in Waterloo they've moved to parts unknown we couldn't trace him down them down would you be willing to accept his induction plaque\nOn his behalf at the Iowa you and I football game so there I was Jeff on the football field name for ... sake watching the big picture Fred Becker in his uniform go up on the scoreboard\nAnd I gave us a the acceptance speech that night in front of about four hundred and fifty people including the board of regents and the president of the University of Iowa\nAnd if after ten minutes when I sat down Fred Becker got a standing ovation\nThen east water lose athletic director Britain Shavers called me up and said Mike worrying all this about Fred Becker and we discovered he's not in our hall of fame so they elected him into these wire Lou hall of fame I accepted on his behalf and then lo and behold several months later one of my best friend's Don half the legendary west one of the\nUh wrestling coach and his wife Donna longtime teacher called me up and said you know Mike\nThey're looking for a name for the new water to the schools are going to build any thoughts and of course they knew I had plenty of thoughts and I showed up at the war in the school board meeting Jeff and gave a impassioned speech on behalf of Fred backer and lo and behold\nThe school board voted to name the new school an honor Fred Becker and on January twenty four twenty twelve\nThe building was dedicated and I was the guest speaker\nAnd I'm gonna wind this by saying Jeff I stood in front of an send the ... group of about three hundred there were a administrators there there were teachers of some parents\nAnd there was a big display unit in the lobby and I said I Hope every student some time during their time here at Fred Becker elementary school will pause and look at the picture of Fred backer\nAnd read some of the material on him and realize what this young man from Waterloo, Iowa gave up\nSo that this nation could be free and he is buried in fair view cemetery Don half and I've been out there several times to clean up the gravesite and my wife Bev and I were there a last year cleaning up the gravesite too he's buried in a circle Eighteen World War one heroes\nThere is so much there Mike and the fact that he was the first all American football player at the University of Iowa that is worthy of note and mentioned in history\nThe fact that he volunteered to fight in the great war that he lost his life and that at the time people in town recognize the sacrifice", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "03"}
