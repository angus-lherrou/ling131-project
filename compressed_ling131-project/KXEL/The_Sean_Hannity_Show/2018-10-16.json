our\nHurricane politics I'm Jim Stein with today's Iowa politics report you may think politicians in our state have a hard time during campaigns imagine having pivotal races coming down to the wire when a devastating hurricane decides to alter the equation\nSuch was the case in Florida as hurricane Michael came ashore last week the devastation will clearly take months and even years to clean up and to be any communities will simply never be the same but\nThe Republican governor of Florida Rick Scott is running for the U.S Senate looking to one seat incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson\nIs a key seat for both parties obviously in the attempt to hold a majority in the Senate Scott's attention of course has been diverted elsewhere directing effort says the chief executive of his stage\nBut Crossley I have to say that's not going to hurt him in the race since his leadership during such crises has typically been well thought of\nThe mayor of Tallahassee is Democrat Andrew Gillum who is his party's nominee to replace Scott as governor he was forced to suspend his campaign as the hurricane approach as Tallahassee was thought to be in the direct path at one point\nAnd these are people who come from very different backgrounds have had very different levels of success and they're able to share their own stories about what helps make them as successful as they are and it really comes down to the individual building a team around them I mean John ...\nHas some wonderful ideas but with out the ability to put them into practice with the team they're just wonderful ideas\nYeah so every single one of these speakers brings something different to the table\nBut it all culminated in helping the participants understand that in this\nFast paced ever changing world\nWe have to make a leader shift we have to be more agile more innovative more flexible as leaders than what we have ever been and each of these speakers brings something very unique to the table in order to help our participants get their hands around such a big concept\nIt is too simplistic for me to say who should attend because the answer is everyone because you get something different depending on where you're out this is not just for managers or top echelon people corrected for anyone who wants to develop their own inner leadership skills or their own abilities\nAbsolutely so leadership has to start with the individual first and anybody whether you're a student I'm a line worker a CEO it doesn't matter everybody needs to develop themselves so that they can have influence and develop those around them\nNow one of the best case scenario is for someone attending it's certainly a team from an organization\nBecause it gives them the ability and the day off site to have conversations around how to apply these concepts when I find most teens get back to their organization they get caught up in the day to day\nBusiness of it and they forget to the plan for an intentional around how they're going to use the learning of the day and so throughout the day we actually stop and we talk about what is it we're taking away and what are we going to do with it\nSo it's a great opportunity for team building and fourteen to walk away with the same concepts and the same vocabulary around these kinds of topics and then be energized take that energy back to the park and the stations\nBut we also have a lot of tables of individuals who are meeting for the first time\nThe bill some great connection some great relationships and even have some business that comes out of it\nThat's what's cool about this ... this is one thing to say well I'll just watch a weapon are well first of all you have to take the time to watch the weapons are and you're always going to be interrupted or you're going to have the temptation to do something else or going to a site where you can see these folks speak me as a video presentation\nYou've already help yourself in that respect\nBut I don't know how many times I've seen people in I've fallen victim myself where you go and you're all energized and then you get to work the next day\nAnd it's like somebody pops the balloon because you either have to take care of what you missed or put up a small fires that day and so this was really designed to helping people branch that\nBy stopping let's think of some action steps that can be taken the next day so it doesn't seem like such a monumental task and then three weeks later you've forgotten everything\nAnd that's the beauty of attending with your team when you attend with your team you have that shared experience which\nPlaskin than three weeks later you've forgotten everything\nRight and that's the beauty of attending with your team when you attend with your team you have that shared experience which then allows everybody to come back to the workplace and allows you to tap into somebody else who had the same experience to experience that\nThat excitement the motivation the inspiration and somebody who gets it so you get to have conversations with those individuals a week later two weeks later instead of it being just you having attended and trying to get everybody else on board with\nAll of the amazing ideas and concepts that are shared\nSo it's a good thing for a team it's a good thing for individuals because again that may be the the best way to do it and even self employed folks I'd say probably derive some bumps that as well just in learning best practices\nAbsolutely we all get stuck at some point we all get caught up in the chaos of the day to day is going on in our business and so you know as an owner myself I Am very intentional\nEvery year around taking particular days to step out of the business and work on myself as the owner and work on the business versus in the business\nAnd this is that thing that and if that way to step out we calibrate realign get your cup filled up so that you can go back and inspire those around you\nSo someone listening might say well that sounds great but I Can't get my work done in my eight or nine or ten hour days it is I Can't afford the time to step away like this wants to counter to the\nYou know that it's kind of forgot about that is such a common common issue and what I find is that when you take that time to step away\nIt refreshes you every flushes your energy and it gives you a different way of thinking about things\nWhich then you can come back to organization with different tools but also a different level of energy to tackle those kinds of things sometimes the reason we're so overwhelmed is because\nWe have so much on our plate that we can't see the forest for the trees when you step back\nStep out of your organization for a day\nAnd you re energize you you get to come back and bring that new level and that new you to the organization and all of a sudden those things that were really difficult yesterday become not such a challenge today because we just met three other people who\nGave us some great ideas or we listened to John Maxwell or Tyler Perry\nTalked about the hiccups they've done through the challenges that they face and all of a sudden we realized that there is nothing in our email box\nThat is that big that we can't handle\nIt's one of the things we're again it's attitude but you do need the reminders sometimes too I don't want to say hit the reset button because let's let's trade little a cliche but that's really what it is you have to recharge started again and maybe you do your work from another location maybe to get out\nAnd go to a seminal arts so that you have a better sense of the person that you can be so it's a real important level of development or else you wake up and went five years and years and and you are no different than you are before which is really a shame\nYeah so ... has this leadership law from the Twenty one year futile irrefutable laws of leadership where he says that there is this law the lid and the laws will then essentially is\nThat wherever your leadership effectiveness is that going to be the cap on your results and so for example on a scale of one to ten if your leadership lead is it a four year results are only ever going to get two or three maybe if you work really hard\nFor but that's it so the only way to improve your results for yourself or your organization is to raise your leadership effectiveness and to do that you have to engage in continual growth and development you have to be willing to invest in you\nAnd you know for those who say well I just I don't have the time this isn't the right time I I Can't take you know and a day out of my business\nDaniel Pink is actually going to be talking about the never ending stream of when decisions so he's really going to go feed into a lot about a tiny is a science\nAnd it's one that we can use to make smarter decisions to enhance our productivity and our effectiveness so if you just want in that particular piece alone the day is\nWorth the price of admission just to understand how timing is a science and it can be applied to your day to day\nWorld there is a separate thing you have to spend money to make money well you have to devote time for development so that you can have a penny off of me more productive it may seem country at the moment but everything sitting on the desk and wait\nBut developing us a better person and a better employee you can probably handle ditch the stuff on the desk more efficiently if your butter and you have to keep growing in developing\nSo that you can maximize your own potential\nAbsolutely and you know that was one of Carly the rainiest topics is really going to be about how to tap into your potential and the potential of your team\nI'm so not only are we looking at making a leadership to become more innovative more agile we're also talking about tapping into potential or talking about understanding a better level of how to make smarter decisions\nHow to understand the timing of the things happening in your business and then also for those of you who are working with the team you probably have somebody on your team who has a challenging mindset and that's one of the things that Deborah ... is going to be talking about is how to overcome some of those\nObstacles and challenges that block your mindset from being in the state of growth and learning and being able to tap into your potential\nSo it really is a very well rounded curriculum for a day um the other thing that is different this year is we've actually been approved for sea use\nSo if you are an individual who's involved in short term you know that you have to invest in yourself to maintain your credit nation and we actually have a couple of different sees available including shrimp CEOs which makes the day even more valuable\nSo that's very familiar to me too so um it wasn't as hard as if it was on a foreign locations somewhere\nWe're talking with Lynn Austin award winning author of Christian fiction her latest book his legacy of mercy we're giving away a copy each morning this week during the ... morning news and the setting is interesting it's it's a historical\nNovel but it's set in places as you mentioned that you have some familiarity with what is it is a difficult process to re imagine what a place that you see every day looked like a hundred years ago or more than a hundred years ago uh when when you're trying to write about it\nYes it is I have to there there's not a lot left here in Holland up from the original um like the giant hotel where an estate out on the shores of Lake Michigan has gone there is nothing there now it's just the park\nUh so yeah I have to kind of use my imagination and a lot of old pictures it's fun to get out old pictures and imagine how it how it might have looked when I write I make a bulletin board with pictures of\nHow I imagine my characters to look and the and pictures of the setting whenever I can find them and that way when I sit down to write I can just look at this bulletin board and I'm instantly immersed back in the in\nThe setting of the book\nNow last week we talked with another author\nWho are in in a similar way had written a lot of uh novels a lot of fiction about historical topics that he put a lot of research into I think that you're in the same situation and and his latest book was a\nNon fiction project about some of what he learned a about particular characters historical figures that he put in his novels\nHave you ever been tempted to look into nonfiction\nWell I did write one non fiction book\nAnd it it's sort of a devotional I went on a trip to Israel and um I was going through kind of a rough time at the time and so I Do put a lot of historical stuff like for each site\nI'll have some of the historical background and why it was important in the Bible and yeah it's I found it hard to switch to non fiction after I'm used to action\nBecause I can just let my imagination go but you can't go too far [laughter] that it wander too far away nonfiction\nLynn thank you so much for spending some time with us I Know our listeners who are are going to a win copies of legacy of mercy will enjoy getting a chance to to read through and I'm sure many of our other listeners will be able to find copies as well thanks so much for

Jody hanky loyal their meal plan by putting a barrier between environments and the bomb as you're living in the country and like\nThe country like ideas an inspiration for your place in the country you can find more information on today's topic than from previous shows by visiting us online at living the country like dot com will return to the show after these messages\nWe all know that was hard

no matter what color equipment you run [noise] bring quick lift hydraulic fluid will keep it going\nAnd we and this is the same time we're subsidizing through our tax system the purchase of insurance by employers because we pay three hundred and forty two billion\nDollars that I Want I Want you to really hone in on this because this is one of the things that\nWe hear all the time if you do away with the current system of health care in the United states is going to bankrupt this nation right\nAnd this is not true the truth is we can't afford not to do improve Medicare for all we can't afford not to do it the reason is simple we will spend more money in the present system and it will eventually mean bankrupted businesses\nIndividuals who can't get care and of a shrinking pool of covered lives what we had in his system now you don't have to take my word for Michael we had a conservative Institute the Merck hottest Institute\nFunded by the Koch brothers who did a study on Senator Sanders Medicare for all bill they determined\nThat it would cost thirty two trillion but the footnotes said the prison system would cost two trillion more there is not a policy argument against Medicare for all because everyone recognizes it will control costs better\nBut we haven't been told that that's incorrect what\nYou've been told is the governments\nCan't do it or we can't afford it but when they say that what they're talking about is if we spend it through government we can't afford it and this is this is the mind twist that people have to understand you may pay more in taxes to get universal healthcare but your costs will go down\nSo yes this is this is the mind twist Americans have trouble understanding business folks understandably so say well that doesn't make any sense it turns out in healthcare it does it turns out it's more efficient as Medicare\nOh say well that doesn't make any sense it turns out in health care it does it turns out it's more efficient as Medicare proof Medicare spends at least a half maybe a quarter of what private insurance spends on demonstration\nMedicare sets race for providers that are basically break even as to their cost of providing care there are some discrepancies private insurance doesn't do any of that they just keep escalating premiums and it works for them the drug companies get a little bit more of the hospitals get a little bit more the insurance companies get a little bit more workers and businesses pay more\nBut the system\nDoesn't actually provide care it just as a revenue model for all the industry players the game the financing half of which or sixty percent of which comes from the public so sixty percent of health care spending is public we're not getting their money's worth\n... yet because that spending is to subsidies of private insurance not direct provision of care and people don't understand that I Know why should they they've been told the government's the enemy\nOr the problem\nAt least and then it turns out well in health care is actually the solution\nYou know one of the things that we consistently talk about is where the United states is in relative to healthcare costs and then those outcomes of healthcare and among the industrialized nations you know we spend more ... individual on healthcare\nBut our return on that investment was one of the lowest among industrial how does that work\nIs it is ironic that we spend more and get less yeah so what we're saying is we could actually spent less and get more [laughter]\n... imagine that rough and and it is right because we spend on average\nMore than twice as much per capita as any other country and yet we have worse health outcomes [noise] we have worse health equity so we have a much less equal healthcare system and as you know what I mean wealthy individuals will spend less than point five percent of their income on health care\nBut but working people are spending ten twelve\nFifteen Percent of their income on health care so we don't get the outcomes we don't have the system that provides care when people need it and that's got to be the principal and here's what all these other countries do that we don't guarantee health care with no barriers to care\nThat doesn't mean you don't pay for healthcare it means if you can you still get care in this country you get all the health care you can afford and if you can't afford it you don't get it that's the difference guarantee health care with no barriers to care well let's talk\nAbout that for just a minute you're an expert in this policy area Michael and you've been crisscrossing the United states for a long time talking about Medicare for all single payer insurance universal care whatever you however you want to call it\nPushed back that I hear from individuals is oh well I my great aunt ... lives in Canada and she had to have a hip replacement but she was put on a waiting list for six months to get that hip replacement\nAnd so for that reason this whole thing of socialized medicine if you will\nIs bad and the funny thing is I you know I've never heard Katie and say we want\nThe U.S health care system there is not a country in the world or a trade with us [laughter]\nThat is I think about these anecdotal stories like I can come up with an act old story that says a person couldn't get treatment in the U.S had to go to Canada for\nHow many how many Minnesotans or northern Iowans are getting their prescription drugs from Canada yeah I mean let's be real about people's daily experience here\nYou know what are the things that you just said is if we're paying anywhere from ten to Fifteen Percent out of our pocket for healthcare coverage as a working class Americans\nAnd then you add to that the cost of living with regard to housing that sometimes can run anywhere from twenty to forty percent so we're eating up a significant amount of our daily\nWage paying for a roof and healthcare but that leaves a very little to live\nExactly and those numbers also tell us Michel ...\nOutcomes are worse because we don't we can't afford good housing\nWe can't necessarily afford regular care so what you find is the social determinants poverty unemployment inadequate housing poor education these have a huge amount to do maybe the primary reason our outcomes are worse\nAmericans by the age of sixty five have two or more chronic conditions do that is twice the average for comparable economies around the world and why is that you think Michael they don't get health care\nThe other countries guarantee health care with no barriers to care forty two percent of Americans in according to a Kaiser Family foundation study I think it was twenty Seventeen\nDeferred treatment because of cost didn't buy a ... a prescription fill a prescription didn't go to the doctor didn't seek treatment\nSo forty two percent of Americans are not getting these are insured Americans insured for Americans what about the ... and what about the uninsured they have they they basically the we we estimate that the uninsured probably have at least I'm\nA fifty percent of the level of access to care that the ... that the insured have at least fifty percent could be worse\nOur guest is Michael lady ladies and gentlemen he's a founding fellow the Sanders Institute I Want to come back to you on something that has happened here in the state of Iowa recently the farm bureau has a rolled out what they call insurance program short term insurance program [noise]\nAnd they can't really call it an insurance program because of really isn't but a lot is being touted all across the state from the farm bureau\nThat this is a stopgap measure this is a way that which are individuals who are members of the farm bureau can opt in for this insurance which is not really insurance 'cause they can't called that\n[laughter] and and have\nMaybe some of their health care\nCovered right [noise] well there I mean are we just reaching for stuff we're reaching for stuff because there's this false premise out there that if the premiums cheap the healthcare is cheap all their documents the premiums micro they're not talking about affordable healthcare\nThese these plans like the pharmacist a Farm Bureau association plan are marketed to the healthy people who haven't had a car accident yet yet\nYeah because if you need hospitalization and you've got a ten thousand dollar deductible\nYou don't have any safety you have no guarantee so this is just being able to take advantage of the low information out there about what affordable means when it comes to health care and if you reduce the premiums somehow that's affordable\nExplained to me this than if you're working\nClass Americans and I don't you know I don't know what that definition is anymore I work every single day so I guess I'm One of them um and I don't I'm not enrich by my four oh one K. or my investments in the stock market I suspect that's like most individuals\nAnd I don't I'm not enriched by my four oh one K. or my investments in the stock market I suspect that's like most individuals if for example\nOur health care premiums continue to go up we are having to spend more of our money on to the doctor was more of our out of pocket expenses all these things how is this nuts how is this seen as a as the enemy of the people if you will\nRather than something that's going to help people in other words people say oh that's a democratic plan so it's bad of your ... I I'm just not getting the disconnect when\n... when this is in front of everybody everybody's kitchen table and if you're carrying for elderly Americans or if you're caring for mom and dad grandma and whenever you see those those denials claims coming through\nA yeah\nTwo hundred million claims denied here by insurance companies and what um what what actually I think is the case Michael is that people do get it we don't actually have a problem with your average worker in America on this question they get it\nClear tomorrow night back to thirty or so mostly some you get on Thursday and it's going to be breezy at times once again with highs and the upper fifties\nNext cold front comes by on friday that one has more clouds may produce a couple of sprinkles here or there but it's pretty moisture starved otherwise it's another breezy day at times lower sixties lower fifties on Saturday partly cloudy skies that they looked fairly blustery as well with winds perhaps ... thirty thirty five miles an hour every now and again\nVery typical fall weather and temperatures pretty common for this time of year as I recall\nYeah exactly our normal high is a write about sixty or so um and we're not going to be too far from that most days yeah coming up tomorrow or fifty so about ten degrees sort of normal but later on this week we're going to be closer to that a magical normal number which we have not had much of this month\nAh especially for dry days in fact uh I don't think they're really been any of those that up until a day or so\nThe phrase normal not something we have used this month at all but it does look to be very nice as we get to homecoming un I and other places coming up on the weekend\nAbsolutely with dry weather coming up on Saturday will certainly enjoy that and of course you and I playing in the dome\nThat's great because they don't have to worry about the wind at all or he'll gators yeah you're going to have to be contending with that those would be wondering about the Iowa homecoming game this weekend wind is going to be a factor at connect a but for Sunday look for another nice day they're mostly sunny lower fifties\nAppreciate the inside is always\nYou better have a good afternoon\nTV meteorologist Justin ... speaking to us here from the weather lab in Cedar Rapids and we'll check the forecast again just after the top of the next hour a new start Fifteen forty ... [noise]\n... live in local continues now I'm Tim Harwood time now for a science of parenting update with Cindy Thompson of Iowa State university extension Cindy thanks for joining us thanks for having me ten\nThe costumes stores are open there are costumes for Halloween in many other places grocery stores in some cases other retailers you might even see some kids running around the neighborhood\nIn their Halloween costumes little early to test them out\nIt's that time of year again which is a special for parents especially with the younger kids who are just getting into this whole Halloween thing or anything that you would recommend based on the the science of parenting research when it comes to choosing\nWell first of all I'd like to touch base on how important pretend play is I mean we often underestimate how little children know about the world you know we got decades of experience there just figuring it out so drew ... eight you're out on that can play around with\nFamily will they can play around with a fire fighter will leach for things\nLike that that they see every day but that are inappropriate for them to actually do go to ... at the end of the characters really helps Penn State\nYou're out in the world around and it really helps them with emotion tree eerie at your preschooler elementary and so by pretending to be brave firefighter or fight pretending that Bert ... and being able to calm that baby doll down nearly\nHelps children manage their emotions in a way that they can in day to day life\nSo I'm looking at Halloween stuff that you find it interesting dilemma for parents because sometimes children get very particular about what they want\nAnd she ends and staff that can be quite an interesting dilemma for parents because sometimes children get very\nParticular about what they want and I also had parents be very particular about what they want but the thing that we wanted to be watching for obviously I'm non violent ones which are um research has shown over and over again that violent place that impact children's behavior um so so that's one thing\nThe other thing when we're looking at pretense play is often trying to Floyd characters so instead of a Halloween costume that at that particular Disney character I caution that's more um open ended ... the child can be a variety of different tests that\nSame with a white costumes instead of an actual character on something that the child can\nDo a variety of different roles because what we know about protesting players and we're hoping that it it can be more beneficial and when we focus on costumes that are based on media character it really closes off that pretend like\nThat sounds like it could be a real challenge because I Know I'm going to see Spider Man in my neighborhood on Halloween over and over and over again as a parent what's the strategy for trying to pull attention towards something other than those\nBright colorful masks and costumes that you're seeing on the store shelves to something that's more appropriate in in the terms that you're setting out\nYeah so things in moderation and um and so if we keep that in mind if a child has our hearts sat on a Spider Man or a Disney character princess\nThat's completely fine we have to find a middle ground with our children but if that's the case then we encourage parents to find lots of other ways for children to pretend in that\nOn Halloween though so I'm old phones all cameras um household items stuffed animals and ... both boys and girls\nOn the encourage parents to participate in the play with their children tell if a Halloween costume like a Spider Man costume and up and the ... the pairing gauging with the child with fat caught you so much on instead of a child acting out the spider man\nSaid over and over again ... ... what would happen if Spiderman ran across um ... what would you take I mean do you know just throwing out things that are outside of that media raw and give children opportunity to extend the play in a way that it outside of that on scripted media\nCindy thanks for being with us as we get closer all the time to Halloween and uh I Know we're a little early but happy Halloween\nThank you very much and it might seem early by that and parents have this on their radar and have for a while I appreciate and opportunity to droughts and I considered a
