month\nEar on taxi alive and local we appreciate it greatly\nSo the stock market this is one of these things where you need to have the acids in your desk because if you're watching this closely it is quite a roller coaster why is that the case\nThat really has been a roller coaster some huge update some huge down days this week alone I I think that the a rising interest rates as clearly as concerned both short term and long term interest rates\nThe trade war with China continues to escalate and I think that's taking a toll and now the new thing as a possible threat from Saudi Arabia I mean with all of the controversy going on there\nA ... the ... investment conference next week everybody's basically canceled going through it and that's a big reveal to them and they said maybe they'll retaliate by raising oil prices to a hundred dollars a barrel of somebody like that so that's that's a new a disruptor on top of the other or disrupt as we've got this made the markets are very volatile here\nIs this the kind of thing that is going to really blunt the gains that had been made over time or is this something that you think may be a short term blip we keep hearing phrases like correction and I'm not sure anybody really I don't know what that means\nA correction officially as a ten percent drop from the peak\nAnd you know we have all time record highs at the end of September so we're not that far off the all time highs area but I Do think this is going to blunt the growth because the the two big areas of the economy or housing and autos and housing is being hurt by higher interest rates the thirty year fixed rate mortgage is now over five percent\nOn some people just saying I'm not going to go by I'm going to rent 'em because it's just too expensive not only the mortgage rates but the price of homes has gone up to an unaffordable level\nSo it's not only the house itself Jeff but when people buy a house\nThey buy carpeting and furniture and electronics law things have kind of go with it so it has what they call the multiplier effect sure are and the same with cars that car sales have definitely slow down a lot recently\nUh because people are the costs of financing that has gone up on the price of the cars have gone up a lot as well because of the inputs steel and aluminum other things that they're having to pass on to the consumer\nI'm so those are two major drivers of the economy that are now slowing down\nAnd I think the stock market looking forward whatever six to nine months and saying things are not going to be as good as they are now than and that's why the markets discussing it\nAnd again there is the multiplier effect but to me there are also the dominoes that fall when we look to certain leaders and if those stocks that had the momentum throughout much of the aren't doing well our other dominoes likely to fall just because we're watching this and then we worry about that\nAnd that's what's been happening are the leaders of so called met them stocks Facebook\nGoogle sales force Microsoft apple Amazon Netflix all those kind of companies had been surging and they picked kind of like in June and July really and they've been generally turning down since then and that's been the leadership group\nUm so yeah I I agree with you when leadership falters other things falsely behind if anything was doing better now are the kind of defensive companies\nFor example today a Proctor and gamble chemical or better than expected earnings so that's the kind of stock that people might go to less dependent on economic growth a more kind of stable demand and so this is the move from growth stocks to value stocks to some extent\nUm so I think that's the direction things are going\nNow I recall back a decade ago when we had the big economic issues\nThe folks who sold consumer goods\nThat the public\nThe big economic issues the folks who sold consumer goods found that the public was really concerned about their money and so what they were doing was going back to tried and true brands and the best example that I saw from\nMarketing was craft brand macaroni and cheese they actually increased their marketing budget during that time and everybody else retrenched\nAnd it had to outcomes obviously if you're not advertising people forget you're there so you have to be advertising\nBut people were gravitating toward comfort food and known quantities well can we extrapolate that in some ways I mean when when I hear Proctor and gamble it is is doing well and Facebook isn't that suggesting a similar mindset\nAnd I think to some extent although I think that the buying generation to millennials are less brand\nA loyal than the previous generation are and they're willing to buy generics or natural foods and areas that you know in the past probably wouldn't have been doing as well um but I think you're right when when the economy turns down people get more conservative and they go to\nThousand dollars Washington DC has

music\nTheater you and I always includes a musical in our season of plays and uh we chose this piece specifically because we knew it was becoming more popular and the fun nature of the show and really felt that there were a lot of roles and that that would be really accessible for college students\nYou're doing it not at the regular un I venue but you're doing it at the uh a venue that a lot more people probably are familiar with ...\nThat's why we normally produce theater you and I ... on the campus and this time I'm we're following up from two years ago when we did the musical into the woods or the Gallagher blue darn\nAnd found that the calendars worked out so that we were able to produce this show there as well um that's a really unique opportunity for our students because it kind of takes a different approach it takes planning a set that you can take apart and put it into a truck\nAnd on Saturday morning as a matter of fact the twentieth we'll\nPull up into the loading dock of the Gallagher with a truck full of scenery and props and spend the next six days building that set rehearsing to show getting the music we've done and then on the twenty six we open the show how many performances\nThree performances total there's a the friday night Forman says it's seven PM and then the Saturday and Sunday performances or both two PM\nI asked a on how the Gallagher blue door in stage house are different from the stray or would theater\nThere's a lot more seats in the house so it's a much larger venue which creates a interesting and and challenging environment for the college students in terms of projection in terms of playing in a larger space so it's quite exciting to be in there\nAnd we had this idea early on as a matter of fact it was hands idea because the Gallagher is such a large space and this piece is kind of a little more intimate perhaps something that's a little more charming\nAnd so we wanted to also see if we could arrange the theater space in a way that allowed us to achieve some of that intimacy\nSo there is on stage seating for this show as well and as a matter of fact that's eating as free\nAnd so if people are interested in sitting on stage and there'd be closer to the action there are times in the show were audience members are involved in the action but sitting on stage doesn't necessarily targeting you as a sort of I'm not going to be involved right but uh it's a unique way to see the show because you are right up there with the action\nHe'd be the audience for the spelling bee yes yes that's the that's the kind of the whole thing yeah it is a music goal so you needed orchestra or do you\nDo we have a music director by the name of set butler he's someone who's worked on our productions before and he's assembled a band that includes himself and for other people\nAnd um he's been rehearsing with them he's also been sitting in on the rehearsals that and has been having with the cast as acting as the rehearsal economist and
