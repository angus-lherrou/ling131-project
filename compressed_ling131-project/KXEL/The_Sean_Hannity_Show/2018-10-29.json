chief in a surge in Wisconsin yeah and uh I'm running my successes first of all when I learned when I realized when I heard that the only two people may be running for two positions I feel that's just wrong there should be racist should be contested so the voters have a choice\nA so I decided I'm going to run and uh I'm running my successes as a public administrator of the past Fifteen Years my successes are practically unless the crime rate and sturgeon bay dropped almost fifty percent when I was the police chief\nIn Waterloo or to the point where almost forty percent down a one of the things that I'm most proud of a ... and well and I want to add I'm\nI have the ability based on my experience over the\nPast Fifteen Years to navigate political waters I Am one of the things I'm most proud of an an example is that is when the Evans Dale cousins were abducted an Amber Alert should have been issued it was not\nA something wrong something happened that was a not right\nUh so drew and Heather Collins tried to get the cousins law passed they're working to get a law passed to fix that and I had a conversation with drew I've gotten to know drew quite well a sin sadly since that incident a board they have like a brother to me\nAh I said drew let me research in the study is let me see\nBut we're like a brother to me ah I sub drew let me research at the study of let me see where the problem is and let me see if I can fix that the problem wasn't the law it\nWas a policy or I was a flawed policy uh so I Alone tackled that I had ... I had some people in my corner some elected officials in case that I needed them ah from both sides of the aisle to help me with this issue but I fought for it ah presented it to the group that was responsible for changing it\nAnd we were successful in getting the policy change so if that's the same exact incident were to happen today God Forbid in Amber Alert would be issued and I'm proud of that that makes a Iowa safer for all children\nA chronic nuisance property ordinance I'm proud of that when I came to Waterloo I was told that was something that was needed\nI talk to members of the community talk to our elected officials talk to the officers at the police department so I researched it put it together presented it to the council that was passed and ah it has been beneficial and making Waterloo a better place I like a good fight\nAnd I like to fight for the people I represent a I'm hoping that the voters decide that Dan trucker represents a he's he's something we want representing us in Black Hawk county\nYou're running as a Republican in a in a fairly a Democrat oriented county at least on the county level of why that's I've always been a when I\nWhen I was in the Marines uh that's when I realized because it was ... I I grew up in a Democrat family union Democrats okay a matter of fact my brothers and I have some great conversations they're both union him there one works for the post office one works for a paper mill in Wisconsin their union guys matter of fact\nEven though I'm a manager I pay union dues because I feel it's my traditionally the police chief in a water who does\nA but they don't have to I just think it's the right thing to do so I Do\nUm uh but I grew up in that union family realize the Marines of these I'm based on these issues I'm I I'm a Republican [noise]\nUm but I very on issues as well it depends on the issue or you know what's what I find intriguing and and this interest me a ... and I still like to study this and evaluate this\nI've been a police chief for Fifteen Years I've worked with more than a hundred different council members even though council members are nonpartisan you can tell what side of the aisle they're on\nI've always always always more than a hundred at work but I've always been successful at working with both ... both sides\nAlways right obviously law enforcement especially of yours yes ah for obvious reasons or anything in that experienced that would lend you to work on particular goals or projects at the county level\nYeah a mental health issues and safety issues those are two of the biggest ones where I have experience and mental ... been involved in law enforcement for almost Thirty years\nAnd a mental health issues are a challenge across the country um but I have practical experience or a ... where I can use those experiences for the benefit of the county quite frankly we need to do better\nUh you know I Would like to see the jail population dropped by I I keep thinking of ... ten percent let's lower the jail population by ten percent not by letting criminals out\nBut by doing better with these mental health challenges so people suffering from serious mental health issues don't end up in jail again some people but for me it also boils down to uh even if you have a serious mental health issue do you know the difference between white right and wrong that's huge for me\nI'm a ... we need to evaluate people a better ... them better and some people simply still need to be held accountable but we can do better with the mental health issues and the treatment people are receiving\nI think I Know the answer to this next question but as long as we're talking about the mental health issues are you a share of Tony Thompson of the same page or do you defer in some ways as to that\nWe never in some ways we differ in some ways I mean uh I keep hearing that the vast majority of our people in the jail are suffering from a ... a serious mental health issue but to put that in perspective twenty percent of the general population can be diagnosed with a serious mental health issue\nWhen I don't want to see happen I I Want us to proceed with prudence and how we address this because I don't want to see us end up in a situation where like they have a names\nWhere this guy killed this woman and I venture to say that he has a diagnosis of both serious mental health issue or maybe you can blame treatment maybe can blame accountability I just want to make sure that uh we don't\nUh somebody doesn't end up on the outside of the jail\nWho'll Timothy engages in a violent act against one of our community members are and the reason they're out of the jail is because well she's he has a serious mental health issue and he's better are being treated in a community program I'm On the flipside of that though is if there's getting an appropriate treatment they\nMay not engage in that act of violence it's a double edged sword\nYeah it's a it's a fine line I think sometimes you have to you have to reverse I'm One of the major issues of late faced by the county board of supervisors was the decision to sell a country view care center north of Waterloo uh\n... if you could critique that for me in terms of how you feel about how the board went about that\nI think they did a good job I fully support what they did it should have been sold\nA I agree I like the prudence they have shown in a ... fine uh by air so that the black hawk county still can be served by the facility\nBut I think that's a the ... uh uh it should have been sold though because uh it's an outdated business plan for counties to be running those facilities I have a sister who actually is the chief financial officer for a company that owns these facilities\nAnd she uh she said yes they if they can uh a function for profit they can make money\nOr the ... among taxpayer money that we're sticking it into that facility was just wrong it's like I owned a fishing boat at one time or a small little it was a\nIt was like a you know they described as a hole in the water you keep pouring money into a country you've got to that point with the county let's uh let's let the people who know how to run those businesses run them so that it can be more efficient more beneficial for the community the county ... county should own a facility\nLike that any other uh things that you consider issues unresolved issues at the county level or other uh goals that you see every cell facing if elected\nI uh I think the county needs to focus more on economic development not developing the rural areas of the county to county B needs to be more attuned to what's going on\nI think the county needs to focus more on economic development not developing the rural areas of the county to county ... needs to be more attuned to what's going on in the cities in the county so we can work in partnership with them to achieve their goals of economic development\nEvery city in Black Hawk county has something special to offer water lowers the port city\nA Cedar Falls off a male offers something unique and appealing I'm so we need to emphasize that more ... somebody from the county board of supervisors needs to attend a tendency to valley alliance meetings and be a member of the alliance\nA ... on a regular basis I Would like somebody to come in from the cities and present to the county board of supervisors what type of economic development is going on in each individual community\nI have a saying that all roads in the county lead to a city yes are responsible for maintaining those roads were responsible for maintaining the bridges however we also need to be a partner and economic development in our county so that we can increase our tax base\nIcons for this particular book\nThat was the most difficult part I worked on it with my editor that sterling we all had ideas about who should be in and what the criteria was that in the end we wanted women who had a profound impact on rock and roll who'd spent either all or part of their career and rock and roll or who were fears\nAre defining what that means um we've had lasting influence so um yeah we we stuck to a rock and roll are in the end\nFor those who expect certain people to be in there maybe some who they never knew about that you are\nBringing that individuals career to a broader audience give us some examples of folks that when I say it's called rock and roll woman the fifty fiercest female rocker tour a few that people might not think of right off the top of their heads\nWell I mean we start with this or is that a star if and I knew from the beginning that I wanted to start with her\nI'm so influential of of great and very little known guitar player who really I mean she practically invented rock and roll guitar as well as rock and roll everything I'm raised in the church play guitar and the church brought it to\nUh the cotton club in New York City um and Duke Ellington and everyone else fell in love with her in New York and\nI'm just a very influential player did the uh the duck walk before Chuck Berry did the wind alarm before Pete Townshend I'm an only inducted into the rock and Roll Hall of fame is here so I definitely wanted to start with her\nAnd I think everybody should should know her like they know Aretha Franklin or Tina Turner um they try to make a mix of well known a more obscure I as long as they had an impact\nThis is the sort of project that breaks to me stereotypes because again we've got a rock station across the hall and immediately I think of guys\nBut we have female jocks we have the male artist this really demonstrates to me and the way the impact of what I think unfortunately has been a forgotten aspect of rock\nI'm Glad you said that because I I feel the same way and I feel like these women um they contributed so much to the music and to the culture they ... they fought their way and they kicked down doors for not just limited rock but for women and everywhere in in all fields\nUm and their contributions I don't feel like they're ever really given enough credit for all that they did and continue to do I mean a lot of these artists are still touring hard Fleetwood Mac or the pretender is they're all Wanda Jackson still making music she's eighty one I mean the you know\nI so yeah they use it for all the they did and continue to do I feel like they deserve a lot more credit than they get\nSo all of that being said is it still tougher for a woman to make it it's tough for anybody to make it in the music business but is it even tougher for a woman or a a band led by female\nI think it's a lot better than it was and I write about this in the book to that even at the beginning of the new millennium rock was very dominated by um ... very um male oriented act like the strokes\nUm it was just it was it was guy bill all over again I mean we've been through the nineties and women and rock and delivered fair and Liz fair and all these other a groundbreaking ah things that we are going on riot girl and and what not\nIn the ... fair and Liz fair and all these other a groundbreaking ah things that we are going on riot girl and and what not and we ended the nineties with the spice girls right and so that did that with him and his him at the end of the Ninety that was so shocking so um you know by the by the early ...\nKind of waste land for girls but now it's a it's a lot better and in fact fender guitar just released a I'm a study that fifty percent of those new guitars are being purchased by young women players so I think we are definitely getting their\nThe chapters are written in such a way that you can quickly income pose the individuals' craft into a little bit about them many of these are worthy of book wings treatment how is that you were able to again good editing I assume tell these stories and puts a short space relatively speaking\nThat is a that's a difficult art I mean I I Would find anecdotes ah that I felt would would be a way into whenever it was that gets at the heart of\nOf the artist whatever really uh makes them tech and a and makes them do what they did so yeah you know a lot of really interesting stories\nUm I Try to to keep a just put as much as little biographical detail and as a as I could just enough so you knew like where they were coming from and some of their personal life but not a lot of that stuff\nOr just enough right um so yeah it it is very hard to distill someone's lifetime anyone's lifetime I mean not just to a rock star but anybody's into a under a thousand words\nLots of great images that is not just a dry read it is well illustrated very nice design\nOr there's some threads that connect them I mean obviously female rockers got it but there's gotta be something deeper that connects either the order in which you talk about these individuals or the work as a whole\n[noise] well yeah I mean I really I went looking for the narrative threats and um I knew they'd be there I mean just to be that the experience of being a a woman in in rock and roll on the twentieth century um I knew that a lot of them would have a we have a similar\nExperience you know one of them is uh just they they really had to fight their way in I mean they were told low every step of the way it's kind of a a classic story\nUm I guess it is now but ... was told by promoters and her label\nYou can't sell at an arena and within a few months by the end of ... he had sold out at her home town of Madison Square garden so we you know it's just it was constantly having to prove wrong the people who were saying no you can't do that and they were saying yeah we can and we just did\nYour woman who works in the industry how inspirational or some of these stories to you yourself\nOh my gosh every single artist in here I find inspirational and and I I Love them and a champion in them and just\nI mean some of the stories are are just wrenching um the things that they they had to go through when I read about sister is that a third a touring during Jim Crow I mean what is a savvy and elegant woman the way she dealt with it she had her own bus\nEverybody slept on the bus because they weren't places they could stay um at one time she toured with Elvis has banned that Jordan airs um who apparently I don't I didn't write this but I've heard it was said that she called them her little white babies 'cause they they loved each other\nA and they would have to bring her food out to the bus because she couldn't go into the restaurant I mean it's stuff that just wrenches your heart [noise] um so yeah I mean but there's they're inspiring stories everywhere are people getting over addiction\n... women helping each other a ... toward the end of the book I write about Slater Kenny who came out of riot girl\nWell when they broke up Carrie Brownstein went off to do that the show Portland is the TV show which is a really popular show and she got all her friends jobs on the show so to me that's that's like that's amazing that's what women are we're supposed to help each other and and that's a great example of it\nThank you so much for taking the time today but more importantly thank you for putting these stories together in this book\nWell thanks for having me on I appreciate it have a good day and good luck with the rest of the tour thank you Meredith\nOaks is a radio personality and
