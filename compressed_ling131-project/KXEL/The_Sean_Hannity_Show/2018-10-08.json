numbers seem higher they are radar for the national\nWeather service nothing much really there's a little bit south of Iowa City down to Burlington also a little bit in western Iowa so we have a break right now but the heavy rain is expected to return tonight through tomorrow morning\nAnd we'll get more from Joe winters and the TV nine first alert whether lab at the TV nine chief meteorologist scheduled to join us in about twenty five minutes from right now\nSome fog and missed in decorum where it is sixty six degrees\nThe bill of rights Institute is an organization a nonprofit devoted to teaching the principles\nOf the constitution and the declaration of independence the young people we do so through a national network of about fifty thousand high school middle school educators\nOn average the teacher is going to be able to reach a hundred students every year and still are reaching all fifty states there's considerable and we're excited to be able to support the the great work that so many teachers do\nIn reaching a students bringing that those those ideas that are so important and you know it's not like kids get up in the morning thinking about these ideas they need to understand what are the habit what are the what are the ways of thinking that they need to adopt in order to be really great for the ...\nSo as you look at that mission and that framework and we have that overlaid on top of today's political discussion or what I Will say ... the way what passes for political discussion today\n... ... what advice you have and I don't have children so I don't know how to address this but I have to think every day of how to talk about it to an audience here on the radio so how do we address these things either as parents or teachers were young people\nWell it's a great question and and you know I think\nYou're right that so often our conversations today you can call them that uh you know I live and work in the Washington DC area it's not that we have our headquarters there because we think the solutions are in are in Washington but you know what we found is that it it really is so vital\nAs difficult as these conversations are to have though we believe that they should be happening in our public schools in our private schools obviously they need to happen um most of all at at at home I have two boys are seven and nine and even within the\nIt happened um most of all let at at home I have to ah boys are seven and nine and even within the uh whole episode about the Supreme Court nomination of judge now justice cabin off\nWe've talked about it I think you can do it with really young kids are mission at the bill of rights Institute is to focus on the high school\nAnd middle school ranks and what we found is that that they want to go to the questions of why um why do these things matter why is it that that we can't or as a country right now seem to have much of a civil conversation\nAnd I think what happens too often when we pulled the plug on these conversations is that students never get the sense that that it's their responsibility they see what's happening in Washington has a big verbal food fight it's ... it's very uninviting\nAnd they start to see the whole uh realm really of what it means to be a citizen as just defined by voting and maybe recycling and that's a really stand brule that's not much to go off so getting to that place of candid conversation is really important\nDavid Bob is president of the bill of rights Institute on line bill of rights Institute all one word\nDot org it is a challenge and it we have come so far from what and again this is so try to me to say but I'll do it anyway we've come so far from what the founding fathers had in mind I I it's very difficult\nI think to try to convey those values when there are not good examples\nOf it dominating our media today tell me a bit about that or am I just have I just been watching the so long as I've gotten jaded\n[laughter] no I think that's that's all I think that's fairly or a very much a a a a normal response and it's understandable to\nYou know our our teachers struggle with is we have conversations with them all the time in fact we just had a weapon are for after hundreds of teachers who are tuning in and saying hey we have this opportunity to teach on constitution day\nWhy does this framework matter and to me why the constitution matters so much does it really gives us a means by which we can have these these these debates these dialogues\nAnd it's not like it's going to end in in sort of a coup by ...\nThat's not the goal the framework of freedom that the constitution of Ford's\nIs how do we put our disagreements into a place where we are not going to end up in physical ... that's what the founders were trying to get over after all that's what the world and dirt up to that point and they ask the bold and audacious question could we do it differently could we establish a regime that's based on the quality\nOf people all people barn on\nThat's an amazing kind of a a a goal to just set out\nAnd I think when we say to our our our young people let's go back to some of those folks that that including the founders who fought for these principles people who did so\nIn a cauldron that is even more divisive than the one that we have today you know think of the debate about a hundred years ago about women's suffrage and think about the debate over civil rights\nAnd then yes go back to those times uh at our nation's founding it wasn't like they were all getting along and saying boy it's great to be the founding fathers and there's all this soccer so easy they were ribbon with strife but the question is\nUm how did they deal with it how did they get over those differences and say it's so important that we forge ahead and set a new standard for offer what government can be\nWell and again now as a lawyer I've studied the constitution it something that that I just in awe when it gets challenged in certain ways but when you just talked about how they were setting up these rights for every one bar none\nWell then we have the suffrage example of women weren't treated is full citizens that's been less than a century obviously slavery et cetera\nHow do you square that with young people because they're smart enough to to figure some of this out and say well wait a minute you're talking about these these great goals that even those people didn't live them\n[laughter] so true and you know we can front at hand on if you did so in free curriculum redo it in you know things like an essay contest where students can weigh in now and say I wanna I Wanna have my voice might say and so in that question that you just published with post which is so vital\nOr what we would ask is how many\nStudents have done something wrong and usually you know are in a classroom every hand goes up or how many have you have continued to do something wrong even though you know it's wrong\nMost tens they raised that's the position that the founding fathers and mothers were in so many of them in fact\nAll of them far no new that slavery was as George Washington said an atrocious basement of human nature and they were trying to grapple and deal with this problem\nThey also had a lot of other things that they were grappling with and I think what we have to do is go back and show the position that they ran reveal them as fully human they were neither demi gods\nBut they weren't doubles their human they struggled\nA sacrifice but the point that I made just a minute ago is no other group of of founder set out to to lay down this marker and say let's judge our success or failure based upon the standard of human equality and liberty for all\nIn laying down down a marker they also judge themselves\nAnd that's something that I think really allowed the suffragette allowed the civil rights are fighters allowed people like Frederick Douglass to stay we need to appeal to those principles of the declaration so that we might accomplish justice for others\nSo if a parent is listening to our conversation or potentially a teacher a little early probably for teachers to be out here in this part of the of the world\nIf they are interested in avail themselves of the resources that you have or they're looking for some help on this topic tell us about what they might find that bill of rights Institute dot org\nWell they'll find hundreds of resources are for parents\nAre ways that you can uh I engage your your your students that when they ask those tough questions you don't change the subject but you say\nYou know what let's let's look at a reading together let's look at something that that time you know is not boring or bland or or ideologically imbalance but you know we have lots of current events resources so let's say you're watching\nA football game right and you wonder well what about that kneeling during the national anthem while we put out lesson plans in which are all sides can can understand the issue at hand and and then some tough questions can be posed an even more that that the parents can get some ah some some answers about how to how to address these things\nFor teachers or there's just a a whole a whole lot of ... of resources ranging from those lessons plans I'm too full fledged tests\nThere's a there's just a a whole a whole lot of ... of resources ranging from those lessons plans I'm\nToo full fledged textbooks or we published documents for freedom for example which is going to primary source documents so that you study those those primary source documents\nOr go back to the original words and ideas and then compare you know how how how are the current events are stacking up to those original face ... students you have a bunch of resources including\nThe uh the means for for earning scholarship dollars in in college simply by writing essays I mentioned we the student's essay competition and you'll find on bill of rights Institute dot org there's twenty thousand dollars worth of prizes their\nStudents are submitted by the thousands each year to us and and we're so excited to see how many are are really engaging in these ideas and and really engaging in good debate that's another thing that's on on our website or our it's it's a debate platform or with different topics like should the voting age be lowered just sixteen\nIowa conducts the caucus which is run by the political parties the state government is not involved a and that is as it should be a because as the state government in New Hampshire says it will hold your selection process for you but we won't tell you what to do\nWith this ultimately is a choice of the Iowa Democratic party in the Republican Party in terms of how we want to select our nominee not told by the government who we should select or ... or ... or or tilted towards one candidate or another but therein lies the problem\nThe DNC can't do anything to New Hampshire or they've tried in years past but it's a state run process and bill gardeners adamant that he's going to be first primary in the nation as he should be\nWe on the other hand or a creature requires you approve of the state of Iowa but our governing body the Democratic National Committee\nAnd so they set us on a road for conflict with New Hampshire\nOr by two requirements one which I think can be met and the other I'm not sure can\nFirst is is that we conduct a precinct caucus as a selection process and we use delegate selected to the state convention or the county convention as a major used to because of success for a candidate whoever gets the most delegates to the county convention\n... percentage wise wins the Iowa Democratic caucus\nA New Hampshire is just absolutely adamant that we cannot go to a straw poll they literally Republicans to do so because they they did that when this thing was originally created\nSo the DNC is now required Iowa to release low raw totals as well as delivering the equivalent Caesar delegate counts\nA bill and China may Troy shared Troy price of the Democratic party chair shared with the he was out to New Hampshire and met with all the time of Troy was out there I was on the phone with Bill because we're old friends\nOf a bill is pretty adamant that he doesn't want raw tools released and he's troubled by the absentee participation\nSo Iowa New Hampshire which with a pack of never crowded each other once we do we lose both both of us will lose are now in a situation where the DNC is set up a conflict with New Hampshire for Iowa that we're gonna have to try to work out but at this point we don't have any resolution of that\nObviously people in both states a little more concerned with an election coming up in November of for the Eighteen but the groundwork has to be weighed very soon afterwards in order for this all come about in early twenty twenty when I asked the DNC chair Tom ... about the conflict\nHe hesitated for a moment and said I think we can thread that needle but he did not give me great confidence that they had a plan other than just conceptually I'm sure we can work it out there are some real as you've mentioned\nDefinitional road blocks here\nYou know there are and they set 'em up and I don't think I don't think in talking with a bill garner the searchers that in New Hampshire he was aware\nOf the dilemma that the DNC has pose and if you leave us alone we probably would have done at the same way with a modification of allowing a artificial precinct absentee participation\nAnd tried to explain to bill how that's not a straw poll but uh you know I don't know where it's I don't know where it's going to turn down a bill is quite a as a cognizant of the fact that it was read it I held the line back in eighty four we got into the lawsuit with the\nWith the national party and he values the relationship but it uh it's it's something we're gonna have to figure out how to do to get around it um one thought\nThere is no party and he values the relationship but it uh it's it's something we're gonna have to figure out how to do to get around it um one thought that I had to ... is is that we can release raw tolls but not until after New Hampshire sell this process\nAnd then try to get to the secretary of the New Hampshire to agree that the absentee ballot participation is not the same as Rob told\nAnd I and hopefully that will hopefully that'll thread the needle\nBut our problem also is the Bernie boroughs yet know the I mean the first of all about half the people who supported Sanders think we ought to go to a primary in June\nA because that's a that would be fair and Bernie would've one and a half of them think we shouldn't be first anyway because after all who are we to tell the rest of the country what to do which goes back to the fundamental question why do we start small states and they don't care so we have a division inside her own party\nOr in terms of how we should rectify the problem as I call him the abolitionist who would get rid of us and then and then we had the DNC and then we have New Hampshire so that Troy ... our have really got their hands full this time going around to going around\nBut it's taken all of this though\nIs what it means to Iowa\nAnd the national spotlight which always seems to reflect favorably upon us because we run an open and the cleaning process and because we actually give everyone the chance a which isn't president if you went to multi state or large state a contest to convince the action\nNew Hampshire is going to hold a primary about a week after Iowa caucuses eight days and so by your suggestions of proposal you would still have the trans here and see that I think the national party is looking for in saying\nIt's a unique formulation in terms of how those individuals who show up an indicator preference how that converts to delegates you'd still have the transparency of it without undermining New Hampshire\nAnd it's our hope if the goal really is transparency that should answer it because eight days and days is not going to make a big difference\nIf it is to make it more attractive or easy for the media to cover that going to really upset this very delicate balance we have with our friends out in the northeast\nWell there is that it had been let me let me go to the question first of all the the question of transparency and the cost has it now exists to after the uh the difficulties and the allegations of the Sanders people whom I liked but I don't have much time for on this issue\n[noise] uh I was asked to head for the state party or a caucus review committee when all around the state held for public here and just ask everybody to come few did had the median to describe how they felt the process worked in what their experience was what was it was which was favorable\nOr had representatives of the various campaigns president had\nCounty officials precinct chairs everybody across the board and we looked for intrigues skilled to agree and Scalia wagon and we couldn't find any\nWe found out of one thousand six hundred and forty one precinct ... maybe it's eighty one precincts across the state we found errors in five\nOne of them was where the Sanders people refused to agree to the count which was accurate but they were upset because they lost one was wearing policy county we transpose the numbers we gave delegates to I think it was two delegates to Clinton and wanted to Sanders and it should have been one does Clinton into Sanders\nAnd the others were simply facts that they didn't the precincts didn't get their calls in on time out of out of those almost Seventeen hundred precincts\nWe found heirs and five which is what those zero zero zero I mean if the ... you know if if the IRS could get that accurate or not to pick on them but it's the post office could get that or you can get much better than that you 'cause you're never going to have perfection\nSo transparency wasn't the issue\nIt was the Sanders people felt that they didn't win and therefore the process was crooked and and and they did a very good job of pain that Fisher except when we got behind it\nWe found out that know and all the records of every precinct in this state were there for examination by them\nSo I'm not worried about the transparency issue is how you calculate and that takes me to develop a point I'd like to me today it was Daniel Webster he of the dictionary fame\nWho wrote in the federalist papers most people don't realize he was a constitutional is before he was a a a dictionary expert that is important in the Democratic process that we talk to each other and you put people in a room of all the persuasion of all of the candidates\nAnd they talk to each other and they have to declare their preference in public for whom therefore and hear why their neighbors are were for somebody else\nThat that's that's healthy that's democracy it's the lowest possible political denomination you can get and I think that's important particularly if it was important before it's even more important now for the things I said we started the show is is we kind of started talking to each other we got to start lifted each other\nWhen I mentioned transparency that was the phrase that the DNC chair used and I wonder how much of it and I asked him directly about how much some of the shall we say shenanigans of twenty sixteen how that impact what they do\nI almost wonder if Iowa was not the problem but\nThey have such a reclamation project to do and they've recovered on the fundraising pretty well that was really liking for a while I Wonder if that is part of it by saying we are pushing for transparency even if I didn't have a problem with it it looks like the national party is taking control to make sure there isn't an\nAgent and it's probably a very good point because we're first up yeah so they want to make sure that our process the square and I think we can do that and then there she sighed and all this has people want to do the ... different states have tried to do cause they're all leaving them", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year":
