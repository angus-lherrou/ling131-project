America was pushing for was the country of origin labeling on decent pork\nAnd a lot happier which uh which not in the agreement and ... and it had more to do with the fact that we had to change the laws in this country before we could put it into the green ... I'm\nGoing to the country of origin\nI'm a rules of origin will benefit or a number of cinder she's of ours include matter culture little benefits the auto auto industry\nUm and uh\nIt will help create more jobs in this country and the manufacturing sector as well as in in the automotive sector and the agricultural sector um they are a number of provisions that are one of the most unique ones is for a clause in there about Kurt soon ...\nWas the first time it's been any in any of our trade agreements it's the beginning of a a more detailed approach to her she ... which has undermined it are farmers and ranchers at our manufacturers for decades um and uh\nAnother item on there is a electro property profession as the mandate\nProtection for pharmaceuticals and agriculture\nUpdated pat protections unfortunate measures targeting piracy is ... ... ...\nI'm On the digital side of the equation if things were ... trade or um it's cutting discrimination against electronic products\nStronger protections for cyber security um there's also increase the minimum is a shipment XY levels between richer countries we have protections for the U.S financial\nServices and suppliers with a updates to transparency requirements um and a labor practices including rights for collective bargaining\nAnd the requirement that forty to fifty percent of the Arnold got that they produced by workers earning\nAt least sixteen dollars an hour and another may manager a part of this new agreements um and a big auto concept has to be higher than it has in the past and it has to be a I says about twenty five percent higher\n... and that means parts and and supplies because they've come from a plants in the United states and and and the U.S Mexico agreement I was always things add up\nTo a significantly greater agreement for the U.S workers farmers manufacturers and really all this is sectors but I'll tell you what's the most important thing jak mhm most important thing is is this is another step\nIn President Trump's economic agenda traded to make the United states more locally competitive as an effort placed their business to create\nBetter paying jobs not low paying service jobs and to a ... improve our our economy economic growth just as it has in the last couple of quarters in this project to do in the coming quarters that continue for years to count\n'em is formed the basis of of the several agreements now is headed to Korea South Korea trade agreement now we have the makeshift free trade agreement and can't Canadian agreement we shouldn't have won with Japan and you\nAnd all of these trade agreements or part of the trade strategy to deal with China all building up to us dealing with a ... pound gorilla a trade cheated the trade protectionist trade ... stayed on the economy that is undermining the rules are WTO and undermined a global trade for the last Twenty years\nSo far some of the naysayers this all is part of a broad plan this is not just simply some scattershot let's blow everything up just to make changes there's a purposeful manner in which this is what I'm hearing you say this\nAt least some scattershot let's blow everything up just to make changes there's a purposeful manner in which this is what I'm hearing you say there's a purposeful manner in which these are being done and by bringing the north American partners together that is further leverage that can be used against China\nAnd I left you only about forty five seconds to answer\nYour really correct you're absolutely correct that this is part of a very strategic well thought out plan despite what the media shares of showed about ... percent sure you haven't been involved in putting it together\nBack a few thousand Fifteen ... this is a well thought out strategy by the ... Robert Lighthizer real garage president myself and others make sure that we have a strategy here where\nMany Gulf or in the store to trade ... or less ...\nStart learning to trade the right way simply called eight five five eight four four seven zero to\nWith option\nNot since ... financial risk and is not suitable for all of that\n[noise]\nThe voice of eastern Iowa four Seventy five years and then some news talk Fifteen ... why local produce a October seconds hello I'm Jeff designed KFC all news time now is three forty Gary RIAA on press row at the top\nOf the hour this past weekend on the Iowa wants connection radio program you heard of conversation about the state of journalism in America\nAnd I had an extended conversation as part of that program with the executive director of the Iowa freedom of information council Randy Evans and Steven bury a retired University of Iowa journalism professor and co founder of I Will watch\nWe didn't have enough time on the weekend program to bring you the full conversation we thought we do that now the very first week during our conversation\nAnd we'll begin with a fundamental question unless you first day of what is the greatest challenge to journalism in our country today well I think the greatest challenge today is that we\nAre confronting\nBut I've almost consider crises in in the confidence that the public has in the news media um and it it guys just preparing for this talk that I'm going to be given to nine or they're looking at a loss of polls actually been talking to a lot of people that since I've been in retirement\nAnd they ... they don't have any idea what journalists do how they go about their job how they do the recording [noise]\nAnd uh and then on top of all of that we have this all out anti press organized ... basically I mean very well funded campaign\nThat's being carried out against the press um and it's carried out at the highest levels of government and and not only is it against the press abstract Clint generally\nBut they're going after individual reporters by name and in the presence and and that that could have an effect 'cause it gets repeated over and over and over again and as luck propaganda you repeat a long enough and it becomes perceived reality [noise]\nDo you agree that that is the greatest challenge and is not what might be I Would agree with Steve on the\nThe the broader challenge but I think that the more fundamental basis I think\nThe media in some respects is [noise] is not helping it cause any because a at a time when there is this widespread skepticism about the believability of what people are reading or hearing\nA we have newspapers that are that sort of walked away from editing and are leaving it up to reporters who are\nLike ... brothers jugglers all that is being expected of them and you know if you don't spell somebody's name correctly if you had the wrong\nStreet address people's suddenly ... don't believe anything that that they're reading and I think that journalism has to go back to the basics we have to focus on a you know fact checking and double checking in triple checking\nYou know we have to focus on fairness or you know that's not going to solve the bigger problem but it's it's not going to add more fuel to the fire it's interesting to me that you ...\nYou know that's not going to solve the bigger problem but it's it's not going to\nAdd more fuel to the fire it's interesting to me that you said that because I have said for a while that people in the media are often their worst enemy and hand someone the club to hit them over the head with\nSuch as making a small factor that does not have a lot to do with the general thrust of the story but it allows the subject of the story didn't say see\nThey are wrong and you go yeah it's that's you're absolutely right because uh you know the last thing journalists need to do is to get anybody in excuse to disbelieve want\nJournalists are gathering up and presenting for people to digest\nSteve we have had similar times in our history where those in power the they in government or business or any other form of power have\nTaken after the media what is different about this climate welding\nYou or your uh to me I think you're referring going back to the era of Richard Nixon when when he um when he unleashed to Spiro Agnew was his beautiful litter to creativity I think we all can remember the ... of negative is and we've all got that we can say it [noise]\nUm and and but that's that's this is so different because\nNixon pretty much uh marinated his hatred privately and he sat around and grew up in enemies list and wrote it down privately and that didn't come out and to some ... grand exposure\nSpiro Agnew was noticing that long a and his is this a campaign against suppress it wasn't I couldn't have been more than a year if I remember right\nAnd what's going on now as we have a president who has acknowledged in public and this this is on the record he has acknowledged don't publish my plan is to bash depressed as hard as I can but the sole purpose of demeaning\nIndividual journals demeaning them so that and to to question their credibility so that nobody whenever you write a negative story of I mean nobody's gonna believe this is an all out campaign\nAnd and it's very concentrated and he and he ... himself personally every single day he does that send surrogates out there to do it for him he doesn't have self and so that that's that's what's different that's what's different\nAgnew of course came to Des Moines as part of that whole thing they come to the heartland and and make the statement to the core of the country and I find that interesting but to to your point about the president\nWhen the president points out individual journalist by name at a news conference sometimes they stand up for themselves and then it's again it's like Dan Rather versus Richard Nixon and Nineteen certainly for kind of thing [noise] given how pervasive media is and viral video a phrase we didn't even have a few years ago\nIs the president actually getting a little assistance if they get sucked in or take the bait and then don't respond to it I think it's the manner of the response but do you think you're fine with with one of these reporters giving as good as they get\nYes and um go down and talk about that night I'm ... I'm going on me of something that ah that I don't think I don't know that was that a lot of journalists would agree with me on this and I didn't agree with myself just about a year ago [laughter] until about a year ago but but I Am guy I've gotten to the point where\nThis current administration has made the news media story it is and it was a very very important story on hand through no fault of our own we did not ask to become a part of the story but he has made it\nHidden he's made it because number one it's a it's an integral part of the White House policy\nAnd number two when you have the highest office in the land organized and challenging the constitutionally sanctioned entity that sanctions with protecting the public's not our right but the public's right to a free press\nWe are obligated our ethics obligate us to stand up to that and we have not been standing up\nTo that based upon what you've heard from Steve he obviously has a a very clear idea of what he would do if you were in the White House press corps is that the way that they should be handled in your mind well I certainly understand the ah you know the desire to sort of stick up for yourself\nYou know I think though that if you if you approach it from the standpoint of Joe ordinary I Won a who ah you know doesn't like necessarily what he's hearing coming out of the White House\nBut he also uh maybe thinks that the media is a little too over the top and how they're responding to the president of you know if you tune into cable news or you know unless you've got\nHurricane Florence it's it's almost twenty four seven of what Trump is doing and and I think it is a giving an\nUh an inaccurate a picture of what the media as a whole is doing because you don't see\nThe other stories are being reported on CNN or MSNBC or\nAnd I think that that is queuing public perception or that the public the public is concluding that the the press the media is is out to get depressed because all they can do is talk about the negatives about him [noise]\nAh I think Washington journalist probably need to spend more time and east over shoe Iowa and talking to Joe ordinary Iowans about what they're thinking and how they're reacting and\nHow the president's statements and policies are playing or because I think I think the the east coast press would do that I think they would ah understand why are the public perception is the way it is\nI Want to ask Steve about some of his ideas but you hear probably first among anyone in Iowa if there is a concern about how a member of the media is treated through your role as director of the Iowa freedom of information council that is the job is to protect the interests of the public through the media", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "02"}
