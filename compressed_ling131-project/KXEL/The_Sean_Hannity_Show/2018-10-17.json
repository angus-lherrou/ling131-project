continues now I'm Tim Harwood Steven gays is a professor at the University of northern Iowa as well as being director of the un I Center for Holocaust in genocide education and just opening a short walk from campus if the ... center in Cedar falls a new exhibit\nResistance and rescue photographs by Judy Alice click men and professor\nThis exhibit focuses on Denmark in World War two and its relationship to those of Jewish extraction uh I think folks are probably familiar in many cases with the diary of Anne Frank with what was happening in central and Eastern Europe as it relates to\nDuring World War two what's unique about what happened in Denmark and why is it something of interest now Seventy five years later\nWell the the way that the German occupation of Denmark a unfolded was very different\nFrom what happened in other countries Denmark was occupied in April of Nineteen forty\nAnd for three years um the occupation was rather benign of the day there's government was allowed to continue functioning and the restrictions on Jews and and other day they're citizens were mild by comparison with what was happening in the rest of Europe\nOr that began to change in Nineteen forty three and a when word got out\nThat the Jews of Denmark which was a very small communities some eight thousand people when the Jews of Denmark we're going to be deported presumably to death camps in Eastern Europe\nOr the Danish community organized in part by the Danish resistance\nUndertook a community rescue if you will that involve many many different things hiding Jews in the homes of families France party them to seaside towns and villages from which they could be taken across the sound\nTo Sweden which was only about three miles a cross the water\nAnd doing whatever it was necessary even hiding or some Jews in hospitals\nUp to try to uh protect this segment of the day this community and and it was remarkably successful I'm\nMore of an eighty five percent of the Jews of Denmark were brought to safety some were not some were deported to a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia and in fact I'm In\nConjunction with this photographic exhibition we're going to have a lot of other activities\nUm including a film series including the speaker a who was an eight year old child who was arrested with his parents and deported to Czechoslovakia managed to survive\nI'm we're having a book reading group for people interested in reading a very good book all the conspiracy of decency about this whole episode finds you give people a sense of what can happen when a community under takes a the rescue of\nPeople in danger\nOr there's a lot about the rescue of the Jews of Denmark that's been romanticized and exaggerated\nBut this really was a a remarkable effort on the part of ordinary people just like us who were appalled that the treatment of their fellow citizens and that's something that we're trying to\nMake people aware of and to celebrate a as a kind of triumph of human decency\nWe're speaking this morning with professor Steven gays\nHe's talking with us about a new exhibit which has just opened at the first center resistance in rescue photographs of Judy Ellis click then which highlights the Danish resistance and efforts to help Jews escape from Denmark during World War two now\nJudy Alice click man is a contemporary photographer so the photos that people will be seeing are not the type of photos that would be archival that they might be familiar with from other ... counters that they would have had learning about the Holocaust\nHow does this exhibit tells the story that you've described\nYeah that's a very interesting point there are actually very few archival photos of this and hire a rescue episode of a ... men took photographs in Denmark\nAnd in Eastern Europe more than Twenty years ago this is not a new exhibit it's appeared all over the world more than two hundred different places\nShe took portraits of people who'd been involved in the rescue either\nA hundred different places\nShe took portraits of people who'd been involved in the rescue either ... Jews or a rescuers\nShe took photos of places that were involved in this ah whole historical event\nChurches were Jews were hidden a fishing ports from which row boats and fishing boats and other small craft were able to take people across a to Sweden\nAre also a few photographs of what could have been the fate of the Jews of Denmark without this\nHelp um their fellow citizens of photos of concentration camps are but that's a very small part of the exhibit so it's it's very impressionistic I mean you have to put together there are captains of course but you have to put together the story\nAnd the only personnel issues I really think about our every now and again I think a particle get somebody knew an additional person said here's what happens to sons very granular but it's but it's vital\nWe had our first need ... of a priority to find somebody because someone leaves\nOr get sick it's crisis manager at a ... and ... that's that's how we begin to think about high and we think it said disruption that why do I have to do this this is a PIN and I kind of business to run I got to get this done so I can get back to the important stuff\nAnd the mental mind set doesn't jail that says\nNo hold on a second hiring is a skill set that as an organization we got to be as good at that as we are whatever the core thing is that we do if we're Taylor's we've got to be good as high as good a hiring as we are making such but if we're tiny manufacturers we got to be as good a hiring as we all manufacturing cutting\nIts core skill because here's the thing\nYou're going to be doing it for a far more at\nHer and the bigger you get the more you're going to be doing it the more you're going to need it so you better get good at it but this is not chosen ... intellectually understandable thing that we start by thinking of it as a defensive negative disruption and so we never really build a processor on it we just turned to it\nYou know what's that going to look at our fast when we have to do it on some high get through it\nDoesn't account ladies and gentlemen we are talking about how your business can be a protect predictable success business the book is called predictable success getting organization in the right track and then staying there All right if we were to break this down last two really manageable\nParts wants the first\nThing that a business owner or entrepreneur needs to understand in order to get to that point to be a predictable success business\nThe first thing that they need to understand is that it's all about what happens in the four inches between their left ear and they're right here thinking right eye that I'll take your word for that I Can't remember where I still have them\nBut it's not abide the mechanics or I don't understand why people think it is they think I got to change my business model gotta change from a strategic plan and got us change my goals got to change my mission vision and values and that stuff's right you do have to do all of that\nBut you're only do it in a way to get you there if you make a mental switched in the middle touches this it's a very important what um what are the groups of folks that I work with are mostly what I called visionary owners so they started the business they have a vision for their business\nBut the reason they started it was for absolute freedom an a ton of me but the number one reason people start businesses I'd want to do it and\nI don't want to live in a ... if people all around thank God\nYou know one of the definitions for I don't think a ... a set this one by one of the definitions of an entrepreneur is somebody who stops working forty hours a week for somebody else to work eighty hours a week for themselves right how true want freedom an atomic\nThat freedom and autonomy important thing but there comes a point at which it is the single biggest barrier to grow because the ... who wants to be able to come in and turn the business on his head on a Monday morning or pick up some ... wacko idea that they can find a conference are hard on a podcast\nAnd they want to be able to switch direction very quickly and a lot of that is good and in the early days it's important but eventually it becomes something where that are scratching their pitch\nAnd whenever you need to set your direction to get into predictable success that means beginning to put systems and process in place and odd hearing\nTo set your direction to get into predictable success that means beginning to put systems and process in place and odd hearing to them and that's where the problem comes in division rate doesn't want to adhere to the systems in process just wants to be a maverick outside of it all\nEverybody else is watching their the person at the top of the ... and they realize this isn't really going to stick next week we'll be doing something different than a little bit different the day after that so that consistency discipline is really tough just talked with a guy here at the conference that we're both that\nWho said to me or you know I've realized something I dunno like white water of the things are going to arm because because I'm important and it makes me feel like I'm making a difference and I keep dragging my business back in there we try to our way and a productive will success and then I self sabotage\nAnd I was able to share with them you're far from alone by the way is simple temper hint and that\nIs if you identify with that syndrome\nGo find yourself a sandbox started another little business with a colleague or a friend or go get the heavily involved with your church or just plain somewhere that you can scratch or Beijing ... it'll be easier than to be disciplined in the business if it's not your only son ...\nTip it is it a tip because all of us want to all of us that are visionaries or entrepreneur is that we\nHave that that that continued vision and then we get stuck and then we get stuck on change change is the only good thing can of business that is struggling in white water can they come out of that to become predictable success\nThat's what I spend all day every day during his own people that are just you absolutely can't you're going to make that that mental ship mental rushed and the other thing that ... never really that nice to have to point out but it's true\nIs you've got to accept that if that's what you want to do not by the way let me back up just one moment why would you want to do it [noise] [laughter] why bother getting unpredictable success\nThat one thing the only thing that it gives you is the ability to scale that's what we're talking about in fun earlier stage you can grow and keep growing but it's one plus one equals two two plus two equals four a predictable success is up by J curve it's about X financial growth it's about the ability to scale so that's why we're doing this if you want to do that\nYou can do it you know you've got first mentally make that shift is I'm going to have to discipline myself somewhat more um it's not so much that um there's anything wrong with change but uh our son is not a good thing whenever you're trying to build a substantial business\nSo that personal just when the second thing or the second negative is you can't we will not get there with the ... team that you currently have a hard line that is they're going to be some people who were wonderful\nPeople who got you where you are today but can't get you can help you get to where you want to go on more than not well actors blockers because they don't want it they loved fun they want to live and fun\nOn day with no not necessarily with a negative intent\nThey will end up sabotaging your attempts to get to predictable success\nThey'll disrupt the systems in process as the complaint and gripe about them to try to work around them\nAnd if you're serious about getting there I have never worked with a team that didn't have to that one or two people go as point one point to there was one or two people every time I've seen that happen and the and realized it was absolutely the right thing for them to do because this wasn't this business isn't in the past that that they want to get to\nSo losing good people or people who might have been with for many years have build a very successful business that's painful particularly\nThe businesses smaller businesses have been going for quite some time these are people who you could be that God parents have their heads you know that you that you go to the church was it's really can be rough uh but if you're going to get to protect one success you're going to lose a couple of those people\nThat's ... we're talking about his book predictable success in one of the things that I Do public speaking\nAnd one of the parts of that as I say that there are only three reasons why consumers not buying your product or service one is that you're making something inside of data nobody really wants to number two is that uh you're using the wrong communication platforms to allow people to know about it and the number three\nYou got the wrong people and and and you have just echoed that very very things sometimes\nYou cannot make it happen with the people that you currently have and that is half\nYou know I Would say that some form of Ninety nine point something of all business issues it it comes down to people in the end right I I get a push by folks all the time he said to me\nYou know we'd be unpredictable success if we could just get our product strategy right like we can be unpredictable success if only we could get our distribution mechanism sorted out\nAn endless list of possibilities every single time when we sit down on the diagnostic process I take them through it we worked a three and a half day\nOr just trying to establish what the real barriers are always in back of that the reason the distribution system isn't working the reason that the product strategy isn't working its people related and they're out there they don't have the right people\nSetting the distribution\nStrategy setting the product strategy or I don't mean by that anything judgmental I don't mean that these people are bad or wrong or whatever it's just the different phases of growth require different\nPeople are some people ... mute themselves on more\nUnusually vision refund or owners of as much trouble with this is anybody else but um some people can more through different stages of growth of an organization but many folks most folks are happiest in one particular type of organization with all met the I call them a processor types\nWho really love working and if you go in a big organization in front of screen moving pepper on they like it that's what they should be they not going to be comfortable in another environment\nWhen the other hand we've got our big dog operators that we just talked about her love that fun stage where you know wide riding the range we got you know a lot of delegated us already I get to just do or say whatever I wanted to say\nI I'm just having the ... the ability to transition one of the\nThirteenth things that I talk
