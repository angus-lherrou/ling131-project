water\nWho has a history of supporting abortion laws and gun control they want someone that looks just like Ruth ginsburg now going to happen\nThey're going to get another Brett Kavanaugh to their head they're going to be tied because what you're going to hold the whole country hostage over this one too they're really playing a game with knowing gay\nBut in fact isn't that the endgame or to be emboldened by\nTaking down Kavanaugh and then they'll say All right now we'll just take down the next one and the next one in the next one I I'm just saying from their standpoint they seem to think\nThat there are doing the country's business by doing this I'm just wondering if the in their mind or this list actually gives them the impetus to keep doing it and keep doing it and\nI don't know how long you could stall that out they certainly think two years\nOh no no question in fact I'm going to have another ... comes out in the day or to talk about what you just brought up this is what they always do so if you look at Supreme Court nominees and contemporary histories say the last forty years goes toward\nNominated by Democrat president\nGenerally speaking get treated with a bipartisan vote because Republicans understand to the Victor goes the spoils right I mean sure if you want your lecture constitutionally the president is allowed to speak on the court and that's how it goes so you had bipartisan vote on on a way that Kagan\nThirteen percent of Republicans voted\nUh twenty three percent voted for Sotomayor on and on it goes but if you look at Neil Gorsuch\nAfter the filibuster after the nuclear option or all that stuff only two Democrats voted for him\nWe see what's happening right now with Kavanaugh we saw this with Clarence Thomas and all of this leads and all the stuff they tried to hang on air we saw successfully eliminate Robert Bork this is what they always do when Republicans take control of the White House and the Supreme Court opening\nHang on AM we saw them ever successfully eliminate Robert Bork this is what they always do when Republicans take control of the White House and the Supreme Court opening happens\nBagel crazy they go nuclear they drag out whatever's large and squeezed they can to prevent people from being appointed to the court so this is nothing new they do this every time\nThey were ... centennial Institute fellow founder of Rocky Mountain black conservatives and the column he mentioned he is at the Daily Caller you can search the inter webs and find that [noise] but I find Derek that there are a lot of Republican voters or individuals who call themselves Republican who's saying\nEverything you just laid out is true then how come our side and he's a Republican sneaking how come our side doesn't play the same game why are we so nice to them and then we get stamped in the back because they don't reciprocate\nWhen you can answer that question I'd like to know [laughter] um I I think you're dealing with people who are more respect for the constitution certainly more respectful of our fellow American I mean you could you can extend the point you just made into all sorts of corners of life not just Supreme Court nominees you don't see conservatives\nMarching around the halls of Capitol Hill yelling and shouting and screaming people down worrying paint Pussy hats and dropping F bombs every third there there are no there is no conservatives\nAre answer to antifa we don't go out and do those things we don't express ourselves by tipping over cop cars are lighting I'm On fire that this is all the exclusive do many of the left so if the question is why don't we play like they play\nBecause we are and who they are we believe in rule of law and no one was happy with the appointment of Sotomayor no one was happy with the appointment of Ruth ginsburg but we understand that's how it goes so reorganized work harder communicate with your constituents in when selections which exactly what we've done\nSo now they're held throwing a shift you fit and a tantrum and doing what they do what they lose and that's just too bad\nSenator Grassley by the way scheduled to be on this program tomorrow during our two o'clock central time our\nAnd he was to have joined us last week for our monthly conversation but as the country knows something came up so how long is this going to go a Senate majority leader McConnell says there's gonna be a vote very soon\nIt almost sounded like he was alluding to the age of the fact that it would be before any FBI investigation was concluded I Know they have to form a procedural standpoint give notice and they may then bumped that down the road but it's certainly full steam ahead what's the calendar suggest from your standpoint\nTo counter suggests a\nIs going to happen as soon as Senator Flake\nIs ready to commit to a yes vote and maybe one or two others so there will be no bipartisan votes where there aren't going to be any Democrats who vote for this nominee we all know that\nNo there'll be any for the next the next the next depending on how many ... so then you have to talk to the caucus and say okay when are you prepared to pull the trigger so we can get this nominee passed\nRight now the biggest outlier would appear to be Senator Flake from Arizona there maybe one or two others as well but I think he's the hardest lie so when he says I'm satisfied FBI has come back and this is all clean and by the way it is a there was another\nAllegation another shame do was come forward today and now he's moved beyond just high school high jinx this one claimed she was raped repeatedly by Brett Kavanaugh so they're they're gonna they're gonna keep trotting these people out here is an interesting thing to take to notice\nAll these women are the first accuser is from San Francisco the second one is from Boulder or the next one I guarantee you it's going to be from Boston or for some other liberal haven none of these girls when they were Fifteen or sixteen years old grew up to be conservative leaning adults that awfully strange isn't it\nThere are no coincidences in any of this of course and again not to diminish those who actually are victims of offenses but when you start putting it all together\nAnd again I use this on this program last week and it's it's it was like cameras wine when James Carville used it but he talked about drinking hundred dollar bills through trailer parks\nAnd you could make the same analogy now it's just interesting that there are all sorts of people come up despite what a half dozen prior FBI background checks for this man\nYeah and you know oddly enough none of them turned up anything it there's two ways to look at it I think what you just said with a dragon hundred dollar bill through a trailer park as one of them or\nWho is Kevin Rowan with on the weekends I mean there was this guy live in a double life so here's a guy who has a high schooler he is attending a private all male preparatory school in a wealthy neighborhood outside of Georgetown\nYet on the weekends he is having grain alcohol parties thrusting is exposed peanuts into women's faces a given girls drug gang rape and I've been running trains on them\nSo I'm a weekend as he rolling with MS Thirteen members or or or San Quentin parolees or or what ... what kind of a double life was this guy leading for any of this to be true\nAnd for that double life too of abruptly ended at some point in his college years because it appears they have a very limited timeframe do they not of Wendy's atrocity supposedly occurred I mean talk about ah what finding religion or whatever it yeah point\nYeah I Know the timeframe is when we get into the area of prove ability or believability [laughter] so you cannot prove or disprove allegations from thirty six thirty three years ago but you can from Seventeen\nI as we get into the Internet age and some other things so as long as we can say there is no police report there was no campus police report there was no witnesses there's no statement there is no cooperation that's completely he said she said we need to believe the women\nMhm then they're on relatively stable ground but now if you're pulled this thing to say Nineteen Ninety seven\nThat's a new ball game because now you're doing with a young adult not a teenager and there's going to be some kind of paper trail that someone somewhere can pick up because the Internet's got along memory but there was no Internet Nineteen eighty three [laughter]\n[noise] so let's assume Kavanaugh is confirmed well let me ask you this in our in our remaining couple of minutes if lake is convinced does that ring either Collins or Murkowski or both along because they need to of the three correct\nI eat correct and I I tend to think it does I think flake is the for this on the out ... outside of the ring I I think if he falls in line or at least two of the other three is not all that are all three do as well ah that's my read on it but then again man I mean I thought Mitt Romney was going to win\nSo [laughter] you know my son the liability is a prognosticators well documented\nSo did a lot of the polls well let's assume that Kavanaugh gets on the court\nSo that the liability as a card master curator as well documented\nSo did a lot of the polls well let's assume that cabinet gets on the court\nThat will be two justices that President Trump has appointed in only two years that's a head of the pace of his predecessors in office needed eight years each of the three predecessors needed eight years to get two justices so let's say he gets another one next year\nWhat levels will we\nSee in terms of history on ... theater with regard to a Supreme Court confirmation\nDepends on the results of the mid term election so yeah he'll get another one the question is at what point in his term maybe to them uh you got a couple of just over Seventy years of age you got one with a warrant for them to grave and the other on a banana peel it who knows how long she hold on for\nA so it depends upon the makeup of the Senate after the mid term election will know about him to enjoy the November ... but not only did you just what you just said is true but here's what people need to realize well\nWhy not go back because there's a method there let's go find the information and put together their story because I Want I don't think many people knew in great detail\nThose earlier two books about hockey in the cedar valley they're available at totally Iowa dot com if you're interested but this book ball hawks\nAnd I agree with you that there are people who may have sort of heard that there was an NBA team in Waterloo but we think of today's NBA\nWith Steph Curry and LeBron James and before that Michael Jordan before that Larry Bird et cetera we think of the NBA on that stage this was the absolute beginning of the professional basketball league that we now know global\nYeah the the NBA at that time was just a kernel of of what it would become and in fact it was actually two different leagues which will make sense when you hear their names there was the national basketball league which was mid western based it was the older league\nA lot of other communities that you could compare favorably to Waterloo are the least would strike some similarities places like Sheboygan, Wisconsin in Osh Kosh Wisconsin or the quad cities Moline in particular I had a very successful team in the national basketball league there were\nSome other teams from places like Chicago in Indianapolis that were obviously a little bit bigger\nBut a success and a pretty good long run compared to the other professional basketball league attempts in the national basketball league and then\nThere was the Basketball Association of America so that's how you get NBA with these two leagues combining and that's the cities in the east Boston New York Philadelphia Washington and actually Chicago and St Louis as well ah\n... they merged together to form the NBA and Waterloo was there at the beginning of it or in\nA few different ways uh but uh in in their first instance helping the national basketball league to survive an extra season and then when the Basketball Association of America was not able to completely dominate the market then part of the merger between those two leagues that\nFollowed ... Tim Har what you know him from here you know him from the Waterloo Blackhawks and now you know him as the author of ball hogs the arrival and departure of the NBA in Iowa\nHow difficult was it to marshal new information about something and again this is now Ben almost Seventy years that's a that's high end that soon we'll be up to Seventy eighth anniversary of that\nNBA season single season in the NBA in Waterloo how difficult was it to get good consistent information given the passage of time\nI think the details the information was out there it was just a matter of raking them together to form a narrative so there were storylines that that tied together the story of\nWhat was happening between the national basketball league into Basketball Association of America in the mid to late Nineteen forties as they were battling for supremacy the story of the individuals who either directly or indirectly\nHelped Waterloo to have basketball and ultimately for Waterloo Toulouse professional basketball and then the stories of the players themselves are those were interesting to follow an end very interesting\nTo read about athletes of that era because\nPlayers themselves are those were interesting to follow an end very interesting to read about athletes of that era because we're again we're talking about Nineteen forty eight forty nine in Nineteen fifty and fifty one\nSo many of the star athletes of the time the ones that came to Waterloo and that went everywhere else were World War two veterans or they had some reason that they didn't serve in World War two and it was interesting to learn those details and it and to try to bring them into this into this taxed\nIt's a story that to me is not just a sports story it's a story about something important in Waterloo history as we're raging from post World war two into the Nineteen fifties so and again a business story because you're talking about these sports leagues but there were they were businesses then as now\nAs an author did you come to this to tell us sports story to tell a history of people because again the audiences are very different if you're talking about people who love history or you're talking about people who really are into sports and statistics\nI think it is both and I think in interesting legacy of the entire experience for Waterloo is the fact that this is not as well remembered as it might be\nAnd I think that there's a distinct reason for that I've had a few people asked me about this as as I've talked about the project and there was a tremendous amount of civic pride that Waterloo was competing with New York and Boston in Chicago on the same field\nAnd you know winning games the the hawks beat the Boston Celtics at\nThe hip a drone what is was also not again as Waterloo auditorium and then later macaroni auditorium beat the Boston Celtics in November of Nineteen forty nine\nJust think about that that's remarkable\nAnd they weren't the Celtics of later years but they still were the Boston Celtics they're still the Boston Celtics than any time you would beat them especially on your home floor Waterloo very much like Green Bay with the NFL in that respect in terms of the civic pride\nAnd David taking on Goliath if you will and the New York Knicks have been in town just a few days earlier\nSo imagine that but the team in that year Nineteen forty nine fifty the first season of the NBA as\nThe official NBA under that name\nWas owned by people in the community by shareholders and much like Green Bay as the Packers\nEvery one was in some cases it emotionally but in many cases also financially invested in the team\nSo when the NBA left Waterloo and they wanted to get out of places like Waterloo and Sheboygan in Anderson, Indiana they weren't interested in competing against these teams because it didn't look like they were big league opponents\nIt was a blow to civic pride and I think that's one of the reasons why this really isn't as well remembered\nAs it might have been and it's it was not something I think that the people who had invested emotionally and financially wanted to talk about because they felt like it had this taken away from them and\nYou don't really want to celebrate those things you don't want to talk about old girlfriends who broke up with you are left at the altar I guess that's that's exactly it where did the team go from here so the ... played an additional season they answer boy again Anderson, Indiana Denver\nColorado which was considered not really a major league town then because of their geography as much as anything it's hard to get from New York to Denver there weren't professional sports teams\nCalifornia that time a would be in the fifties before you'd see baseball and football teams moving out to the other side of the Rocky Mountains so\nThose teams and a few others that were created formed another leak the national professional basketball league for one more season to try and compete with the NBA but they'd lost a lot of stars\nThey didn't have the the team owners that have the financial resources to really be able to compete and they had some different strategies among them\nNone of which were particularly successful for those new expansion teams or to try to gain traction and so the league\nMade it through the season almost and sort of fizzle it it really came to a head in March when the the teams were supposed to get together for like a weekend single elimination playoff tournament\nAnd they didn't because of it in one case there was a team that didn't want to make the trip and uh wasn't going to be guaranteed any money for showing up so they said we're not we're not going to come along so actually that that season and the national professional basketball league Waterloo says they won the league championship Sheboygan says they won\nAnd there's no one that can really say differently\nBecause of some goofy approaches to the rules that they put in place before the season began uh they said if if there's a team that you play that you either win or lose against\nAnd that team drops out of a legal those games don't count the league went through four teams that dropped out from the original makeup and then they lost one or two others that started midway through the season so it really was a mess and and no one I think can actually say\nWho the champion of that national professional basketball season was and it was it was really just impossible to overcome that and try to come back for another season for any of those communities\nIt almost seems like the most appropriate coda for the whole thing we're supposed to have a championship tournament and teams didn't even want to show up at the end of the was the the capper on that I hate this question when people ask me as an author but I Am in the role of interviewers so I Will ask it\nHow long did it take to do this and the reason why I think that's an impossible question is\nYou don't just sit down one day and say I'm going to do a book there's a lot of thinking there's a lot of\nAccidental research that you don't really need to do because you're doing something else and that leads the project and there's an awful lot of thought but if you had to say from the point where you said yes I'm really going to put some concerted effort into it to this point where I see a very nice book sitting in front of me about how many months or years", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "01"}
