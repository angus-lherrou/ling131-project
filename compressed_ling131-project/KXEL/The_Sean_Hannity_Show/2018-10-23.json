Iowans who have joined us good morning I'm a fifth generation Iowa and and I chose to live work and raise my family and a state I live\nA state where if you work hard and drink bag anything is possible\nMy story is the Iowa story where a small town girl daughter of a factory worker farmer stay at home mom who waited tables tacked groceries and never gave up on her dream of getting her college degree is today serving islands at the highest level as the first female governor\nI understand the challenges that everyday Iowans face because I faced and myself\nAnd that's why as governor eyes lead on cutting taxes growing jobs and wages and opportunities\nInvesting in education and opportunities for Iowans and finding solutions for Iowans health care needs Iowa is working US News and World Report says we're number one and the country but I say we're just getting started\nTrouble\nLike a governor Reynolds like store moderators thanks or fill our was watching this morning\nI'm a fifth generation are when our love our state and I'm running for governor to change the direction by putting people first for me it starts with Tucker Tucker is an optimistic young man who suffered a tragic accident could have happened to any one of us\nBut Tucker was forced into privatize medicated because it was a quadriplegic and their losses in home care\nWe can do better for Tucker in the thousands of our when it's like him who have been harmed by military privatization we can do better for the forty percent of Iowans who are working hard every day and you can't make ends meet because our wages are so low in our incomes are flat let's work together and put people first in our state\nIt's for governor rentals is all about more the shape but for all our was it's time for a change\nOr thinking of trouble in our first question by ...\nComing around on the morning the fetal heartbeat law he signed that bans abortions once in a heartbeat is detected but doctors see a heartbeat is detectable often before a woman no she's pregnant a recent poll of islands from Selzer and company shows more than half the citizens in the state believes the law goes too far\nWhat do you say to those who feel the law would wrongly deprive women the chance to make an educated choice about their own health\nCare what they are passionate and strong feelings on both sides of this issue for me I'm pro life and it's set as governor that I Will never fight stop fighting on behalf of the unborn and for me at a beating heart determines that\nWent heart stopped beating that determined that the beating heart indicates life and I'm never going to stop fighting for the unborn what I think as extreme as Fred's position who uh agrees with her supports taxpayer dollars going to a company that\nSupports um late term abortion abortion on demand and I don't believe that's what I Want\nThe trouble some questions you get a rebuttal students\nI've worked most of my life to support access to health care for people all across our state\nA serving the Planned Parenthood board improving access to low income people across Iowa a server and mercy hospital Catholic board to expand access to health or my wife and I hope ... hospital expand mental health services I work a lot of my life trying to help all got access to quality healthcare\nAnd this governor just keeps reducing access to health care with bills like the one you just described\nWe do everything possible to make sure all our was good quality affordable health care\nWell we are expanding access\nThe women and that's by last year I signed a bill that would bring in unity point to provide additional coverage and access for women all across our state and that's why I'll be a sponsoring a bill next year that will allow I went to the women to purchase their birth control pills a from a pharmacist\nOr governor thank you very much next question though Aaron Murphy\nThank you for a governor Reynolds you in the Republican led legislature this past year you mentioned the tax cuts that are you employed um would you like to see more tax cuts implemented in the coming session if you if you're elected if you're elected\nWhile as someone who had to work nights and weekends to make ends meet I'm going to fight every single day to help I only keep more of their hard earned money I cut taxes Fred on the other hand wants to raise taxes he wants to raise taxes on hardworking Iowans in families and small businesses\nI don't believe that's the direction that we shouldn't go\nEither way that we should reduce taxes and for and provide a smaller government and he wants to do just the opposite so I Will continue to fight for Iowans to fight for them to keep more of their hard earned money and we're seeing a the economy grow because of reducing taxes were seen wages increase\nWe have a balanced budget surplus of a hundred and twenty seven million dollars and we're going to continue to give that back to Iowans are and we're going to continue to fight for that\nI'm going to get ... more should we expect more to afterwards and I said last year is that still given the fluctuations even in the state budget\nWhen we're seeing the results have reduced taxes and wages increasing and that's been reflected in a growing economy\nWe have a balanced budget hundred and twenty seven million dollar surplus\nAh the revenue estimating conference just indicated we have a hundred million more that'll go into the fiscal year Nineteen budget we did it by being fiscally responsible by maintaining our priorities of education health care in public safety and that's the same approach that will take next year to help Iowans keep more of their hard earned money\n...\nComprehensive now health care reform that built on the progress we started in two thousand and Thirteen in addition to that we provided flexibility for school counselors from\nFor mental health advocates and for social workers and teenage suicide prevention that helps educators get the training that they need to identify early warning signs for mental illness so that we can get our young people the services that they need to get them healthy and that so that they are able to learn\nAnd to have a great quality of life so we'll continue to build on that will continue to work with schools to make sure that they have a high quality colonel granted place\nTime governor governor Reynolds uh how's your initiation provided enough funding for school safety\nThey there is finding in addition to that there's also been on a federal grants that we've been able to draw down because we now especially with mental illness that this is so important\nAnd historic investment in K. twelve education were fourth in the country only three other states have provided more funding and K. twelve education in Iowa but the flexibility that we provide as last year with some of the categorical fighting allows schools to utilize those resources for\nMental health counselor social workers to to help educators see an ad\nSome of the early warning signs and so we're going to continue to make that a priority it has been a priority\nAh and I'm proud of what we were able to do last year with both the teenage suicide prevention and the comprehensive mental health care reform passed unanimously every single legislature legislator at in the house in the Senate support at that and looking forward to a really implementing though it's a great idea\nMiserable do you believe school funding a Suzie defunding is where it needs to be\nWell actually what I what I'm afraid of is what I'm listening with the governor is talking about in terms of mental health accrue from criminality the sounds to me like she stereotyping mental health is a bit about people who have mental health issues as the ones that are committing these crimes\nJust not true it's not fair to the mental health community ... to be saying that yes we have a criminal issue in our state in our in our country we have a public safety issue if we properly fund our schools which despite what the governor says we're not doing it was about eight years or wrote about a one point three percent average increase in student funding on our schools\nInflation has been two and a half to three percent each of those eight years as where are our teachers and the people in the school buildings are asked to do more and more every year with less resources the falcon ... in Iowa a teacher there are told us about her her textbooks for middle school\nThey're ten to twelve years old pages are falling out and there was no money for new books we need to properly fund our schools and if we properly foreigners schools were going to have ... in the school building as well as nurses and people who have mental health experience governor thirty second\nWe are properly funding our schools and we're going to continue to do better and we've not cut education in the last administration to cut\nEducation was the call her and then is rationed that Fred was apart as they did a ten percent across the board cut not only higher education that K. twelve education then didn't fully find what they had promised their schools we are finding education or working hard to grow the economy we're seeing encounters rise\nAnd with a growing economy we're going to be able to continue to fast I and I got to the end it is absolutely unconscionable for you\nEyes and with a growing economy we're going to be able to continue to invest I and I got to the end it is absolutely unconscionable for you to say to me that when I talk about passing mental health reform it's a reflection on now that they're criminals that's unconscionable and it's ridiculous\nOur governor next year over the governor is cut funding for the reader schools and the community colleges three years in Iraq I\nThink you're miserable next question now from here and\nWe want to move on to a labor laws given Reynolds uh the the significant changes that were made to Iowa's collective bargaining laws were done before you took office in government grants dead I'm I'm Wondering if you support those changes nonetheless and and if you do why\nWere they necessary if you talk to a lot of teachers do seals the changes have done is make it hard for them to negotiate for their benefits with those ages necessary\nWell what does change his dad was actually brought taxpayers have to pay plan gave them a safe at the table but most importantly what it did is it provides schools and local governments in the state the flexibility to manage the resources that they have so that we don't see another ten percent across the board cut\nIt gets local school districts and the administrators the opportunity to manage the revenue that they get to reward teachers that take on additional responsibilities and they have the option to negotiate just like they did before if both sides agree you have seen some of the school districts go ahead and put in place a five year contract\nUnder the old system you have actually seen some of the school districts that are rewarded at teachers like the special education teachers would take on additional responsibility to give them an increase in their salaries\nConfidence in the administration and that at the local and state and in our school district to make the decisions that they need to make I Am so appreciative of what our educators do for our young people my daughter's a party chairman or that and make a different time for the response miserably\nResponds why not let ministers flexibility\nWell let's go back to the Nineteen seventies\nThere was an agreement between Bob array of bipartisan legislature controlled by Republicans\nTo vote for the teachers and the state workers to give up the right to strike and exchange for getting collective bargaining\nIt was a trade it was a common agreement it's been that way for or forty five years it's worked just fine in our state we didn't need to change it in fact I think it was purely for political reasons they wanted to do that they wanted to reduce the impact of labor unions in the state to strengthen the Republican Party has nothing to do with being good for our state\nAnd and uh they actually violated the agreement that was put in place in the Nineteen seventies when they gave up the right to strike in return for getting a collective bargaining now teacher state workers don't have the right to strike or collective bargain it's not fair and the next thing the governor is going to do if she keeps control the legislature and wins this race she's going to take away our neighbors for future teachers\nThat's exactly what the Republicans have done several other states and she's been following that same agenda the first year the Segway collective bargaining the second year they take away quick about it for ... time in St Louis Hubble their benefits finally when I found that I have\nAll I always are tuning in because this gives me an opportunity to address that's had on I Am a strong supporter\nOf I ... I've worked in local government for Nineteen years had collies all across the state again my daughter is a teacher they hit promises made and promises kept we will not take away either this is a promise that we make people are making their retirement decisions based on it\nAnd I want to assure Iowans that we while you know what when you ran out of ideas and you have nothing to run on except for raising tax\nUs time grazing ... he's got a scare tactic question from forest to\nName one were real quick say Mr humble I'm On those collective bargaining laws then would you make an attempt to reverse those changes and and the government should do the right to work law as well as they would you advocate for a changing now\nI think we need to work with the legislature to restore chapter twenty just the way it was before and to restore the collective bargaining rights for teachers as I said there was no reason to to change those other purely politics\nMix good shows to restore those rights door hardworking families in this country and in our in our state and by the way the governor talks about current high profile people she has made no promises to protect diapers for future state employees or future teachers\nThat I Will do that 'cause it's a very well managed program is one of the best in the country there is no need to make hardly any significant changes in mood about right to work\nIf the legislature determines at the right to work bill she'll be passing the give me a bill is good for small businesses and it was good for our economy I Will sign a bill\nHigher taxes more regulation repealing right to work talked about bringing economy to a screeching halt again it's the only option is going to be to raise taxes and we are growing the economy I first pension is about eighty percent find out why why not the best in the country\nBut the way that we keep that finding the way we get a hundred percent funding like it was when I actually served on the ... sport\nIs by growing the economy balancing the budget having a surplus and helping I went to keep more at their hard earned money that's how we're going to end a ensure Future Islands that that tension is going to be there for ...\nThank you governor I'm a I'm Sorry we need to march on Washington now reduces funding worse I started with miserable\nTo these are some topics that are focused on President Trump's and some of the things that he said in recent months she'll starting with you Mr Hubble and then a governor Reynolds you will have a chance to answer this question as well\n... to Kevin hearings President Trump suggested that the hash tag me too movement was quote very dangerous in unfairly threatened in entire clash of powerful men do you agree with these comments why we're wind\nI'm running for governor of Iowa\nI'm not running to the other thing to do with anything outside of Iowa\nWe need to make sure that Iowa is a kind of a state that Chris opportunities for everybody to be successful which means we need to have the right priorities discovered it keeps talking about raising taxes I Want to stop wasteful spending\nAnd invest in education invested in health care there's plenty of money in our budget we don't need to raise taxes we need to be smarter about how we're spending our money don't have the right priorities\nMr ... direct you to that question because that's what this is all about answering these questions show\nDo you agree with the president's comments that a number to reach data here hashtag me too movement was very dangerous an unfairly threatened an entire class who powerful men I understand that you are not running for president but Iowa is a member of the union and it was like to get your comments and\nA medical school teachers and central I originally they told me in the elementary school they to churn the mental health and substance abuse issues in elementary school or just going out of the root for the last four years just going like this and yet we don't put adequate funding that our schools so we can have cultures in our schools or nurses in our schools\nThere's a lot of things we can do better her bill frankly just Chris more unfunded mandate for local communities so in order to implement the bill that she's talking about or mental health bill either local communities raise their property taxes or they fire schoolteachers they far police and fire with fire the firefighters that's not a\nVery gradually over me on she should be fun to get us to stay out of trouble that's time going scare tactics\nMore scare tactics money money money I had no idea except for to raise your taxes how Fred it's going to even come close to paying for all of the promises that have made that his answer to everything it's more government and it's more money and I'm telling you I Would taxpayers can't afford Pratt hospital\nTo increase taxes on the local community property taxpayers that raising taxes on everything\nAt the managed care at contract negotiations that we just at home and it actually takes into account the comprehensive mental health care\nReform and it helps that start to implement the initiative that your your running mate voted for every single legislator you keep talking about how insignificant says forget every single legislator everyone who voted for this and it builds on the progress that we made in two thousand and Thirteen and if you say it enough and tell people enough\nThey're gonna start to believe that but the fact that the matter is you're talking about stuff and we're getting things that we are pilots lead\nYour general response miserable\nJust like the governor's bill has a lot of nice words which is why a lot of people who voted for it but there is no funding there is no action nothing has changed she just pushing caution ideas on a local communities\nThey don't have the money to do the things I talk to these people all across the state they're not implement any of those suggestions and the bill because they don't have the money for the state's not giving them any money a good example we used to have mental health covered by Magellan we pays them seven percent when the governor or implemented medicate privatization she took out Magellan\nMood mental health into the Medicaid system now we're paying twelve to Fifteen Percent to for profit companies that's five percent more than we're the we're paying now and the service for mental health people are saying those words are it\nWas rather time Mr Obama would not have already voted on Iran to rise air will move on to the next question from Aaron ...\nVon ... would be remiss if we didn't talk about jobs and you can do this morning a this is the question for both of you and we'll start with humans are humble um I was unemployment levels actually in good shape and continues to decline but you know the love businesses you see they have openings you can't find\nThe workers to fill those positions what specific policies would you advocate for that would help those businesses and maybe help Iowans ah find better paying jobs and they're you know\nWill you know that's a very important question I've made it clear from the very beginning I Want to I Want to build an economy in our state to support all Ireland because we don't have that today almost half the young people that are said go to school in the morning on free and reduced costs lunch\nWe're supposed to feed the world and we can't feed her own kids the economy is not working for a lot of people almost forty percent of Iowans are working hard every day many multiple jobs\nThey're struggling to make ends meet that's a state wide surveys the economy's working for big companies are wealthy individuals but it's not working for the working class every day I was we need a building the Congress works for everybody how do you do that you change the priorities are state government you stop throwing wishful talks giveaways out the window\nAnd instead you invest in education job training all across the stage where more highly trained better educated workforce you invest in healthcare so people are healthy when they go to school in the morning when their kids go to school they're healthy the parents would have to worry about him\nAnd when the parents go to work they're ready to go when they're focusing their productive we also need to invest in quality of life and infrastructure investments if\nWe ... we don't have to raise taxes we just knew them under the same or\nAn ... program to justice but I'm also curious these specific view um is Mr hobby right we have low unemployment that his them asking maybe it affected so my winds are under employed that they have a job but I'm getting so he comes to like\nIt got a lot about everyday Iowans and in Iowa for everybody but the first thing that he wants to do is raise their taxes he said he wouldn't he wouldn't have voted for a sign the bill for affordable healthcare so every piece of policy that he wants to do is hurting everyday islands and I know and I don't care if it's two hundred three hundred four hundred dollars and that paycheck\nThat is real money that's gas that's groceries that's necessities it matters\nAnd that's why we're reducing taxes and regulations and created a pro growth environment where we're seeing our economy grow were seven highest in the country wages an increase for the last three quarters straight\nI at the Iowa business council the top twenty three employers and the state so this is the best economy that they've seen in ten years this is an economy that's growing and it's because we're reducing taxes and helping I went to keep more of their hard earned money\nYou've seen in ten years this is an economy that's growing and it's because we're reducing taxes and helping I went to keep more of their hard earned money workforces and number one barrier to see this economy just explode and that's why we've got kitchen already Iowa which helps our kids see them many passed in great careers hearing the state of Iowa\nIt helps adults get the skills they need to fill the jobs that are available today\nAre ... and excited about what we're seeing around the ... so we'll move on to forest next question\nTo talk a little bit about the state budget and specifically hone in on education um we're going to start with you governor rentals this is a question to both of you to go into rentals continues to tell the K through twelve education is getting a better funding increased and most of America not\nThe same can be said for higher education which reaches we endured in mid you're caught shuttering some programs I Will universities and community colleges say they're prepping to do more with less in the coming years should they ended up not where we the money coming from ...\nProud of our investment in education as I set forth in the country and we are proud of what we've been able to do even with higher education you know that's one of the reasons why we are serving we helped tuition\nUm we are at the same rate for two and a half years it's one of the reasons that we have kids more kids than any other state or in the country that are participating in to all of Rome at which means they take ... community college classes while they're in high school\nAnd that's helping keep the cost of higher education down and when they do that they are more prepared and they're more likely to succeed when they go into higher education\nSo you know we had we had a couple of tough budget years everybody had to be held accountable\nWe didn't cut K. twelve education when Fred's team and the ... when they were in charge they did a ... percent across the board cut not only higher education that K. twelve education public safety and public health this was less than two percent cut\nBut we're growing the economy it's going to continue to be a priority we also have to be really careful about measuring so tired of 'em have around by the sheer amount of dollars that we put\nIn like as a quick follow up for them to Reynolds do you foresee a future costs to higher education\nNo because I think we're we're seeing the economy grow we have a surplus of a hundred and twenty seven million dollars' worth seeing that reflected in revenue that's coming into the state so we're going to continue to invest I had to make a decision on\nBalancing the budget I don't get to print money I wasn't going to raise taxes I Want to reduce taxes and so we did hold K. twelve harmless Medicaid and the back sale for local government\nEverybody else had to do their part was less than two percent\nCut the budget the rates in a budget is\nAlmost six hundred that's tight and SARS is seven Mr ... thank you for this will be sixty seconds I Apologize exercise like you\nKnow the governor keeps talking about these tax cuts\nNo our when he was giving a tax cut this you know are the ones the middle class tax cuts she talks about doesn't happen until you're twenty twenty four if all the assumptions about ours economy the nation's economy\nNew geopolitics all around the world come true no business forecasts out five years any more than the likelihood that that's extra for middle class was going to happen at twenty twenty four is no more likely than the cow jumping over the moon let's be honest about let's stop misleading people the reality is we used to be number one in education\nIf you ask a simple goal I went to there when you walk travel across the state like I Do they know we're not number one any more they want to be number one we used to be proud of education we could be again what we need to commit to making it number one that means that we need to focus not on a graduation rates for the facts that\nThirty percent of our kids in third grade don't meet the minimum reading requirement over half of our kids are graduating from high school is those aren't college ready or ACT scores are ... the client three years in a row weren't\nEnough time really fun and talking about throwing all vegetation our states such time\nHave another question for both of you this one we're going to start with you Mr ...\nWe've already faces a series you've done in the previous budget you're going forward if you have to wear would your administration look to reduce so I'm looking for specific answer on areas that you would cut if you had to\nI've been very clear as I've mentioned several of those places already tonight we need to stop giving away wasteful corporate tax there's always the big corporations\nThat don't need them oftentimes don't pay taxes in our state and we could use that money to invest in education and health care we need to stop giving tax weather's to companies like apple Microsoft the don't need them didn't come here for tax credits they were for a new about energy the low cost energy\nAs fun as their local community wants to give tax breaks for the state

program that introduces you first hand until our country's most admired entrepreneur CEOs and explained individuals as a share their personal journey of overcoming obstacles ... to\nMake it to the top on John Resnick ... thanks again for joining us back into your home will folks today is gas than his story can be described as truly ahead of the curve\nVisionary self made and so many first in this man's industry and her son is ... what it means to be a good steward of his fortune by giving back to help others books as I started to prepare for this story and I just told pat a second ago that\nHas meant governor and his story\nIs so amazing um ... it's hard for my brain to grasp around everything dismaying as accomplished handwritten the governor is the founder and chairman of one of the world's most successful and prolific publishing companies international data grew up\nAnd he is a fascinating story folks of what can be accomplished in America if you believe in yourself you got the guts to go for it and what can be accomplished so let's welcome our guest pat and the governor pat welcome to legends of success\nJohn thank you though either to be with us today\nWell we are honored to have you and and I mentioned to you and I just I guess alluded to the folks as I was researching the story of your life you know we try to have a capsule or a witch hunt and capital just a moment\nThe picture of ideology or gas businesses and diversification if we listed everything you do it how to get a second hour [laughter] so [laughter] but much for the listeners um give us a snapshot pat of ID G and other divisions so they can see a picture of who you are what you do okay\nYeah so I had sort of a single mission to try to provide\nInformation about information technology to people all over the world a redo this through three uh three hundred magazines newspapers that we've had Bush over eighty five countries about ... the website provide information\nTo help people choir and use computers telecommunications like chronic products well\nAnd we do about a month out from the two hundred conferences ear or around the world um we're we have about thirty thousand five hundred employees um around the world and our revenues are bound to point seven billion dollars a year\nTo point seven billion with a big be [laughter] and so a lot of the folks would recognize ... tell us when we were hottest titles\n[noise] Ah yes Republican computer world with a PC World Mac world a network world uh CIO magazine as are some of the brands that people might be familiar with\nAbsolutely had at one time I Believe you were the first introduced a dummy series weren't you pat\nOr that tried to ... bucks created the uh but I mean there is a ... when the manager oppose that I told him with a terrible idea that would kill the they get market and people would be embarrassed to go to the checkout counter but\nI have a corporate about policy but try it let's try it in the market and see what happens then of course it turned out to be a huge success of a uh we we went from a handful of book who over a seven hundred different that I mean title and of course about ten year\nThat was an industry unto itself wasn't\nIt was really a mushroom or who grow grow much faster than we ever had imagined\nIncredible and and you know they're you know the statement that you made were you at first didn't think it was a good idea but you allowed or your manager whoever was in charge of that project you without having Thirteen thousand plus employees around the world all these division so I guess you had to learn a long time ago\nHuh that you've got to become decentralized she can't hold on to control every aspect of your business\nOr that try John ... we were I was in business about five years and no traveling all around the country and around the world and I would get back to the office after a two week trip and\nThe big stack and Mayan basket and occurred to me one night that I was slowing the progress of the company by having everyone wait for me to approve a new major acquisition or a new hire because\nI thought to myself what he wanted to take to have a successful enterprise and first thing that occurred to me that there were thousands of success for businesses that\nHad no help guide and somebody at all if I said I Can't be the essential you know a factor in and I think that for business and I thought well there were three key things one you had to find a real need in the market that people wanted to have a failed\nA and then you had to find a passionate leader who would be proud to fill that need and who could have that charisma to recruit can motivate his team and then you had to treat that a person the way you'd like to be treated with\nA lot of support to give them resources they want to give them respect get out of their way and I can accomplish what they can and then ... praise and and celebrate their successes so [noise]\nRespect get out of their way of life and accomplish what they can and then ... praise and and celebrate their successes so that's the time when we moved from a central by type company to very decentralized company\nAnd now we have one hundred separate business you're around the world um you know each focusing on and on a different product or service I I I find that um people they're sort of a guy is of organization that people really can psychologically relate to and feel comfortable with and the\nUh it's about a hundred and fifty people so I came out of\nYou know the uh the origins of mankind we were all basic tribal people and\nWith families of a say twelve people in the family and then there were twelve families in a tribe and forget about a hundred and forty four hundred and fifty people I find that the manager knows everyone name they know their children's name they know their background they know what they do they are and everyone feels important in the process so\nFacts available to people greatly with to be able to\nSee patterns in data super high speed and ... make more insightful decisions and be more productive so I got so excited about this that I took a about two months of saving some paper route to the library and went down to the hardware store\nAnd bought strip civil law whom for oil and a bell wire and a small light bulbs or from flashlights and plywood boards and\nAnd a bill to pay a handmade computer system are made up little relays\nOr that are played an unbeatable game of tic tac toe ah so ah and then I found out when I gave it to my friends that are so excited about this apparently interact intelligent interaction with a machine but then they noticed they could only high they would never win so\nI put a little counter in the back every forty a move would be random and occasionally they could win the last ... found that uh that factor of hope I've made the machine very very popular and it was always lots of people queuing up to play it\nThey just were loving you is and\nIt was really entered into a science fair and what a prize and that attracted the MIT alumni association in Philadelphia\nA you know to get me a full scholarship to go to MIT to study a more seriously computer science and particularly a cat and I was excited about the idea if you if you understood the organization of human mind\nThen you could actually designed computers more effective for more effective than they used for people because if you would see the analogy between the human intelligence and then the intelligence created through uh the electronic design these systems\nNow pat when you got accepted to MIT prior to that were you encourage or discourage from director or the new special to your school\n[noise] uh well that was an interesting point when I did a get a scholarship I previously um gotten scholarships to a number of the Catholic school and they of course the rector says you know why didn't you go to Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that are in the Catholic tradition and ah\nI said right now appreciate that but uh\nI Would like to know ... get myself I'm interested in technology and not want to go to school that has the best reputation\nFor teaching technology and you know the the course they'll have a chaplain there and I'll be able to continue to attend religious services so I uh I said I wanted to follow that course to get the best education I could of the subjects\nI was interested in and they just try to discourage me a little bit but uh I just stuck to my commitment\nYou being kind my research said that the way you're going to get in [laughter] you buy a home in the ...\nThere were um [noise] I think a thumb with a twenty thousand students before me that uh and several had applied but had never been accepted thought it was the first one they have to MIT\nAre very humble man folks are going to find out you know package accepted an MIT he takes biophysics how old is a ... student make the transition in the business and build up what is today a multibillion dollar diversified business\nFrom a self made man building up an organization it's a powerhouse how in the world did that happen will tell you about his first big deal\nWhen every month when a second time in his life he told them it couldn't be done on non resident ... visiting and hearing the fascinating story of pat ... life the founder and chairman of id will be back right after this on legends us as you could almost see done again today starting now\nAnd he's the founder and chairman of id\nWill be back right after this on legends also you can almost see down again today starting now what what about young entrepreneur starting our psyche is going into business and they use your principles and still today with us in\nAbsolutely because so you know the whole course secretive businesses you find it needed ... or or or do something useful for other people so we're in touch with people and you discuss with them you find out what is what needs to have what things would you like to have this you don't have now\nThey'll tell you what types of products and services they want and then check with enough people and you find that common needs\nAnd then you just go ahead and and do it make it happen and say many times they'll they'll pay you when the man says the product in Europe and running\nYour mom it's coming up on margin of success\nHad to cut all the speed down again today starting now what what about young entrepreneur starting out with ideas and going into business and they use your principles and succeed still today was the same principle absolutely\nBecause you know the whole car secretive businesses you find it needed ... or ... or or do something useful for other people so if you're in touch with a with people and you are you know I discuss with them you find out what what needs to have what what what things would you like to have that you don't have now\nAnd I'll tell you what types of products and services they want and then you check with enough people and you find that common need\nAnd uh then you just go ahead and and do it make it happen\nAnd or say many times they'll pay you advance for the delivery of the product and you're off and running\nA this customer base financing is a no I think the most successful way to get a business going because if you go out and raise money from the national institutions many times there you don't want you to be very cautious and\nMove much more slowly and your count as quickly ramp up your business as you would like to\nIncredible and and let's talk a little bit about sharing people were wondering why this it's been so successful and he hoped she'd made other people's successful too because when you de centralized one of the things you did once you've shared with your employees tell us about the Seventy five twenty five split\nYeah we ... we used to I Believe that the employees should share and the growth of the value of the company so we set up by a employ sack ownership plan which which now I'm thirty percent of the company and that it's made many\nPeople in the company I'm you know where it would have retirement plans now five ten twenty million dollars each\nA hand of course that allows them to be a key shareholders are the companies so they get a chance to vote on all the the major I'm a issues that come before shareholders are et cetera so I'm a very big believer in sharing the success of the company with the employees\nWell let's go step further as long as we're talking about sharing success you made you and your wife made a commitment any pledge and huge donation the largest almost kind to this institution till the folks what you've done within the governance well\nI'm as I said when I went to MIT I wanted to study the brain uh uh but but the tools available were so primitive than that one of the reasons I got into this information business was to help provide information to help fix our right to the development of powerful high speed computers and ... and\nA recording systems that would allow one to understand something as complex as the brain\nSo thank you know for the because we did have the resources we\nAre donated three hundred and fifty million dollars to MIT to build the largest neuroscience center or in the world that we uh we have a a team of five hundred people who were\nMaking um detailed scientific analyses of could lead to the curing of mental illness and brain disease you know over the next five to Fifteen Years\nMm not unless it was wonderful story that says you know pat let me ask you something that most people have to wonder okay and I don't put you on the spot but it's fun anyway and\nWhat was it like when you first time you realized that you were a bill you know ... what is the duty of mentally emotionally the first time you say my worst a billion dollars on a second\nI'm actually is a it just like you know some number on a scoreboard I guess to some people it's of the measure of\nA business success but there's a you know there's only so much you can uh you need for your house near clothing and your travel et cetera so um yeah I ... I I just never made any life change for me to see those types of numbers because\nI just wanted to keep focused on and a growing or employed teetering employees very fairly and growing our business and and moving forward and then it was nice that those type of resources develop so we we can start to to\nBe able to get philanthropic contributions McGovern Institute for brain research is the first of three that we like to build we like to\nHave one in Asia and the one also in Europe over time because sometimes\nThe best scientists ... you know don't want to move very far from where they grew up um so the the\nUh the business success has given us the resources to do this type of giving back to society and um and we're just delighted with the progress that these institutions are are making and helping include the quality of life for people by being able to solve that you know the misery that brain illnesses and the mental illnesses cause\nGetting back is so important and all of them are legends of success we had on this show carry that common thread tell me more about how important it is for you to give back and inspire others to give back to being good stewards of what they may\nWell as I mentioned when I first went to MIT I I had the vision in my mind to try to understand how the human brain and nervous system works but at that time the tools to do it you know with three billion neurons and three trillion connections were much to primitive\nUm though one ... one goal I had one and starting in the information business was to help advance the sophistication of goal of high speed computers and brain scanning equipment and um and by the other end of the nineties", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "23"}
