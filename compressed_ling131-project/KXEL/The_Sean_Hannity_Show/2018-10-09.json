November seven\nAnd a mentor and elections are there's it's kind of a curse a blessing you know obviously we have a Republican president so there are challenges along those lines [noise] I'm In the historical challenges along those lines and at the same time uh we uh you know we know that Republicans tend\nTo be more likely to vote that term but I got to tell you a leftist fired up the progress is on the left are fired up [noise]\nI don't know that they're fired up so much in terms of being forced something because I have a feeling there are a lot of progressive ... holding their nose with Fred humble but I I Do think that they are fired up to stop something to to to turn things around\nI think ultimately that may get them out to vote but I think ultimately when independents look at that in these elections are gonna be settled along independence and the and the political parties getting their base out I think ultimately being in favor of something having a record to run on like Kim Reynolds has\nThat has that that moves I Will forward I think ultimately that wins over independent voters as opposed to just saying not\nThis but I don't have an alternative turnout is\nAlways important that it would seem to me is specially in a midterm and especially in a cycle where\nThe differences between the parties probably have not been more pronounced at least not in my memory and so you want to get all your as they want to get all of theirs and then you're going to be fighting about the independence of who really are going to decide this thing\nAbsolutely have that this ... this mid term election is going to be about uh about about the base if Republicans vote\nRepublicans are going to retain the vast majority of the office that we ... I mean I I truly believe that and I think there's a lot of political scientist that many of whom are more liberally oriented that will tell you that so that ... this is about\nI mean I I truly believe that and I think there's a lot of political scientists and many of whom are more liberally oriented that will tell you that ... this is a battle for me it's almost like on Sundays I come in here I did not like I'm battling the Democrats\nI'm battling to make sure that our Republican snow that everything they're pleased with\nCan all be turned around I mean I I complacency is as big of a fall as Fred Hubble is\nUh and and solve it off the trust fund so I don't have free money with the complacency but the but the bottom line the bottom line is if we can get our folks out we're going to be fine I still believe though I I really believe that in that fight for independence\nI really believe in independence aren't going to look at what Republicans have done the fact that they did what they said they would do even if they do not necessarily agree with every single solitary thing I think that ultimately wins over\n'em or their votes as opposed to just saying like friend humble with Medicaid I'm not in favor of it I Want to go back to where it used to be even though he knows darn well that it's absolutely unsustainable I think being in favor of something and running\nForward is always better than stop\nAnd with regard to the things could be turned around and the Democrats no doubt are telling their base\nWith a Republican governor and a Republican legislature look what has happened in the last two for however many years and so if you want to turn it around you need to show up and it is always easier to mobilize people who want to make a change in in our\nFired up about that as opposed to folks who white what they see people complain about service shall we say at a restaurant or whatever\nThey don't often tell you how good a job or you were doing as a server\nAbsolutely and I and and and the ... I think the thing that plays into our hands\nIs what the Democrats are Afghans that just happened is middle class tax cuts is a deregulation and in a better and does the ... were stuck in the nation and unemployment we were named by US News World Report first I mean that that's not Republican talking points\nUm we're in the top ten in many many markers some quality education and we're number one in the nation in graduation rate\nI really think it's difficult I really think it's difficult to make the case\nThat we're not moving in the right direction in in the economic realm and then the education route now obviously there's always going to be some divisive issues where you're going to be able to you know the the the base in each party is going to disagree\nThose are those are more ... we know what they are but I think when when you look at the independence which are going to vote with our pocketbooks which you're going to vote with a you know the the soccer moms care about us being number one of the nation and having a number one graduation rate\nI really think ultimately a those are the the the the female educated female voters in the suburbs are going to take a look at that and and and and those are areas where we know our battlegrounds not only the independence\nThe battleground for the millennials about a grounds for the\nEducated females in the suburbs I like taking my record into this I really do and these wedge issues are always going to be divisive I'm to be honest with you I think the founding fathers would have no problem with us continuing to argue those but is are you better off now\nThan you were two years or four years ago and if you're looking at your pocket book the answer is got to be asked for an overwhelming amount of violence\nYou're obviously focused on twenty Eighteen but twenty twenty comes very quickly and the Democrats have settled what they're doing with ... ... talk about the relationship between the Republican Party of Iowa and the Iowa Democratic party in working together to ensure that Iowa retains\nIts status and how has what they've been doing impacted what you're doing\nAbsolutely on any given day I could literally have to send out a fairly strong um proactive contrast wheat or that involves Democratic Party and then an hour later\nTalk about how we're going to join forces to make sure the first nation caucuses run well if the nature of this job uh you don't take the negatives personally and you have to uh you have to realize in any given day it may go a attack\nUh get along attacking law back and forth um ultimately of what the debt with the Democrats fate and first of the nation and they had a they had a a a a higher hill to climb and that's given the fact that there was a little bit more resistance to Iowa\nAnd the national Democratic Party and I'll be honest with the AFC it's it's a lot easier this year with us Donald Trump early on\nTold me that we were going to be first in the nation I mean look in the eye and said that\nAnd every step of the way um you know like Donald Trump or not like Donald Trump Donald Trump once again kept his promise on first nation so I I felt confident the entire way through but I gotta tell ya I was in the early in the background rooting that choice price\nAnd the and the national Democrats were going to make sure that we were first of the nation\nThat's going to happen again now Troy price line democratic chair and I we have to make sure that our caucuses run smoothly we have the national glare on us\nHe has a a bit more challenging situation 'cause he's going to have a lot of candidates in here and there's going to be candidates that are going to emerge and get a bump out of Iowa ... I'm probably if if he if Donald Trump is challenged in a primary it'll be fairly\nInsignificant in my in my opinion so ... live my role is going to be making sure that independence realize that there is a you know the the flaws in those Democrats coming through but never never are my words going to\nInterfere or verbally or in any kind of a physical sense interfere with the ability of the Democrats to carry out their caucuses in a fair way that would be irresponsible on my part and for the state so yeah it's it's it's the part of my jobs month twenty five percent of the job and we must have\nA strong relationship between the two parties are that Troy is my fourth democratic chair of that I've that I've worked with and honestly every single one of them there has been an element of trust I think that the people of Iowa would be really proud\nTo know what's happening behind the scenes because I I Will I Will tell you that the Democratic chair and the Republican chair we may disagree on a whole lot of things but we do not disagree on how important that says the state\nAre starting to spin on their own hair granted they are pretty fast moving they're very small and size but there is enough they're down to wind up causing some rotation in fact\nA jump over to max to real quick here\nJust to the north of records village but what the weather service is talking about this will be very close to the ball town area and into the Cheryl area as well so the earth rotations right in here found that to be just as a thousand ball town road and just approaching the Mississippi River as well so anywhere from just north of record built back\nUp through ... town ... not quite toward Cheryl but very close to Cheryl and the motion looks to me\nLike it's mainly north northeast is almost straight to the north and you almost never see that kind of storm motion this late in the season so it's mainly north northeast that we're going to be dealing with some of that one of the biggest issue is here this morning too and we were talking about severe weather outlook we did highlight the risk of a brief tornado because\nThe Windsor from the south east near the ground and the southeast wins flow into these little storm cells and you'll notice the dew points are so high today clouds are very low to the ground so that is where we've had some concern here with the fact that this doesn't take much to get this stuff to spin\nHere's the last couple of friends want to show you hear the rotation was a little bit tighter\nJust to the east of records ville earlier that would've been about two thirty that's when I caught Corey update talking about the next frame which then the rotation kind of went down a little bit of just north east of record sales and it seems to be broadening out a little bit towards vault town but not intensifying so\nThat is good news however it's enough there are certainly a continue on with this warning which is until three in ...\nWe do have a storm track put on the kind of broad area of rotation old law town arise about two forty one so that's just a minute for right now both on a two forty two cameras to forty six and as we cross in Mississippi into McCartney um you'll see that at two forty eight so again the storm\nMay get out of that warning area a little bit sooner but also again that's those are the storm that we certainly need to watch very carefully those if you're near have recalling the road right now I'm as it moves to the north of just off to the east of the city of James road I'm In an area to be concerned with right now with that rotation in the area\nAlso just kind of checking out some of the other cells around the accounting um Dubuque metro area\nBeing impacted by a fairly heavy thunder storm right now but there doesn't appear to be a lot of rotation with in that particular storm cell that these are not in the tornado warning the city of Dubuque is not in the tornado warning I heard you emphasizing that earlier this is actually one of the smaller tornado warnings in a long time [noise] um it's an extreme northeastern sections here a\nFew county from ... to the west of Cheryl\nI Know that ah people very interested in the rain totals this is some rain totals from the storms that have been moving through now just this afternoon\nI'm In northern Arizona Johnson county a back toward areas of Iowa county\nUm you'll notice that we've seen almost an inch of rain and very short period of time half inch to an inch and some of those cells that have been moving through that will be feeding right into the Iowa river valley\nI'm more rain is certainly expected across the Duke right now or near the Dubuque regional airport we have also radar estimates very close to a one inch of rain also in that storm that has been pushing the rotation about half an inch of rain so certainly some Heather areas of rain as these storms have been living through his well thankfully right now there are progressing as we see off to the north\nRight around thirty miles per hour so that's certainly helping out\nUm we've had our news crews out they are certainly taking a look at the situation and at this time have no reports of any damage\nUm they have no reports of any power outages and certainly we've had no reports of any official tornado confirmation there just has been the rotation storms and the tornado warnings issued an as a result um we have been honest with you know the notice the national weather service trimming that box back again\nHas that storm continues to move to the north it's now well north of record the villain highway fifty two\nAre just near the city of Sheryl in Bobtown moving as off toward the east or east north east north northeast and we'll be moving across the Mississippi as we have to the next Fifteen minutes that would take it into southern areas of grand county has this time there's no indication that they would extend that tornado warning\nI'm into grant county\nUm they do talk about that there's enough so weak rotation\nI'm In the storm itself from the tornado warning will be allowed to expire\nFrom as that still lives across the Mississippi so stay with you until that storm does move across the Mississippi to just make sure that nothing has touchdown and nothing's been what the good news as far as tornado warnings we've ... we've had more and more this year than we've seen in the past several years I'm no reports of damage or a power outages at all at storms movements or to be a county\nThat's right that the one that's also down towards the ... county let's jump over to a ... to hear what the ... this tornado warning as just about to expire for eastern Marion end of the mascot county area and again the situation where there's enough of a warning there to trip the county when it comes to a weather radio situation but the city of ... self\nIs not involved in that just a couple more minutes on that and the latest on the national weather service also suggest fair that\nThe rotation is extremely weak and because it has not produced anything with this first weather warning issue and they are not going to continue on with an additional\nIt is extremely weak and because it has not produced anything with this first weather warning issue and they are not going to continue on with an additional warning on discounting either so that is certainly some very good news here is a work our way for and we have one tornado warning left then\nWhich is an extreme north eastern sections of the county and this continues to look like it's probably going to be very near the ball town area so let's get up towards northeast sections of divvied county that one's going to expire in one minute now to the ... and we're looking strictly at velocity which is why you're seeing a bunch of different colors that you might not be used to saying hair\nOff the very small warning if an extreme northeast corner here to view county it's particularly around the ball town area there is enough rotation right there that we talked about just a few minutes they'll ball town road\nRight around in there and then crossing the Mississippi River eventually works his way up towards the north northeast no confirmation I think from spotters our city can network right now it's rained obscured\nFrom the area we can't quite that far up the county so we don't have any any can view on that right now either found but that is where this area of rotation here that\nAnd that's working its way out towards north or the fuel you've been here this afternoon for a little while how fast this thing gets going\nPretty fast we had the watch issued a man within about a half hour or so so a couple of those storms and developed very quickly started spending and as a result of tornado warning was issued so very very quickly\nUm everything got going as again we were at a very warm moist atmosphere as you mentioned just out of the perfect a position with a very low pressure down to our southwest for these storms start to spin a bit as they move off toward the north we're all just quite Thompson's back in the first all or whether lab\nCorey anything you've been able to see anything on social media possibly that has a any reports of any sort [noise]\nAre nothing new on social media that I have seen some of your reporting heavy rain today that like you said that's where the severe storm is right now and then their normal thunderstorm moving over the carrier right now I just to reiterate what guy was and again on radar that area of rotation east of all town near and nice of all town so let's not to the northeast\nSo that across the Mississippi River actually had in southwest Wisconsin in ... county area\nOtherwise that came on reports out of the storm but it's such a small storms if there were a tornado in it it would be probably pretty short lived so take every four dollar that someone would have to be right on it to see it\nThanks for the rotation up again ... yeah it looked like it it's a little bit of a spike again they're just in the northeast of all town and this\nHas been one of the more frustrating fall season's around here especially when the fact that these these tornadoes have dropped for what seems like under a minute or two and then have gone back up again and so that's one of the reasons why we're on here with it there's just enough to hear\nThat you sit there and you look at it and I guess enough rotation going on in this particular areas Mississippi's right there [laughter]\nSo uh we're about to see this cross the over the Mississippi River ... can cross the river if there is indeed one on the ground here it can cross the Mississippi River and get in the southwestern grant county but again in Korea was talking about [noise] uh this is extremely localized and unless you're right on it which we have not had any reports of yet\nOr if you're likely not to the the thing at all and the terrestrial rain that also also accompany this will make things very difficult thing\nThat Stevie nine meteorologist ... also heard from chief meteorologist Joe winters and new voice

I have serious concerns for my two children one having severe asthma and myself living in this condition my question\nGlad the steady allowing us to live in the incandescent\nFirst ward council member Margaret climb poles the conditions of homes with raw sewage into them unconscionable and she says fixing the rumble needs to be the city's top priority she told gay actually yells mark Morris she wants to use his district money if necessary to pay for that we're\nWe're sitting on a couple of hundred million dollars in tax money and I believe some of it could be used for infrastructure I Would like to look into that because of that is the case we can start construction now\nYou refer to a knee jerk reaction which I assume was more records somewhat that what you were saying about using to money and so forth what would you say to him\nNo actually I don't believe that's how the mayor mentality\nI think he meant that we have to do to correct protocol of investigating the appropriate ways to handle these we just can't go out and started digging you have to know where to date you have to know what to put in whether it's retention pond whether it's um an event that occurred only in this\nTorrential rains that we've been having or whether it's been an ongoing event\nBecause that changes what you're going to do to correct the situation\nFirst word council member Margaret climb sneaking after last night's Waterloo city council meeting to king actually yells mark Morris ... now six minutes pass through\nThe gate the our GDP benign first alert forecast we have a chance of showers and thunderstorms for the rest of the day otherwise are mostly cloudy with hide in the sixties to around Seventy showers and punish Trump become more likely overnight with locally heavy rain some could be strong as well with low spoke to fix the\nTemperatures slowly fall tomorrow afternoon thunder storms and made me through the early afternoon\nIt's become more likely overnight with locally heavy rain some could be strong as well with low spoke to fix the temperatures slowly fall tomorrow afternoon thunder storms and made me through the early afternoon time TV nine first alerts dorm the meteorologist jumping on news talk Fifteen forty KFC out\nAnd we have had a couple of tornado warnings that have been issued none in fact at the moment but there was a funnel clouds spotted near highways five south of love\n... in South central Iowa that storm moved to the due east of tele to the area east of fellow between fella and ask a loose up with a rotation\nSignificantly weaker that tornado warning was allowed to expire\nAnd the tornado warning that was in effect for a large part of the Butte county also it appears they expired at three o'clock it hopped over the storm did over the river and there is a thunderstorm warning for grant county Wisconsin but again no tornado warnings anywhere in the state now you've got a really a tale of two systems west divide thirty five\nThere is significant rainfall in terms of aerial coverage not necessarily intensity\nBut when you get to the eastern half of the state the aerial coverage is not as great but it is rather intense for example over the past our rather heavy series of rain showers through the Cedar Rapids metro area another little pocket now\nOn the court or between Iowa City in Cedar Rapids those rain showers are in the canon and Delaware counties in addition some other storms are popping up in power she can Jasper account he's moving northward into ... and counties and just reaching the southern Black Hawk county area so all of that\nJust some heavy rain I say just because that's not the level of severe storms but you could get a pretty significant amount of rainfall in a pretty short period of time\nIf one of those passes over overhead and there is a tornado watch in effect for much of the central and eastern portion of the state innocence until nine o'clock tonight again a tornado watch\nMeaning conditions are favorable for the development of severe weather that could include tornadoes that does include the\n... and it does include the cedar valley goes as far north as\nButler and Franklin and Bremer counties it does include Black Hawk Buchanan Delaware\nAlso grungy and harden counties it includes story poll county all the counties along highway thirty from Boone overthrew Linn county\nJohnson county all the way west to Warren County and then straight south into Missouri so basically uh it's sort of a rainbow if you will a with a flood watch around the outer edges and then that tornado watch in the center attitude eastern portions of the state until nine o'clock tonight\nA well before any of the presidential stuff happened and it was still very devastating to me to him but he immediately put me at ease he he likes to joke he he's a really happy funny person um I immediately knew that he ... he was a good guy and and then I Would be welcomed into this family um\nFrom from the first day\nAnd he's a great ... father in line to great grandfather to our son lieu who Thirteen months old now\nI'm usually I you know with all of our nieces and nephews throughout the years\nUm you know he gets mischaracterized as this completely hardened person and that's not who he is at all you know he is bold and brash and stand up for our country and certainly says what is on his mind but he cares so much either very caring person he is a very loyal person\nOn and of course you know he's got a soft spot in his heart for his family and and those he cares about so um I hate to see of course all the taxes and then they missed characterizations of him but um I guess it's it is sort of the states we live in these days so it's it's par for the course\nIt may well be the world we live in but I don't think anyone anticipated the venom that came out during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings give us your thoughts on that whole process watching it from a distance but also knowing many of the individuals that were involved\nWell you know I Am a civilian I I'm blessed to work with the campaign but I don't work in the administration or the White House so I watched alongside everybody out there on TV [noise] um yeah I I thought it was absolutely disgusting I think\nPeople are paying attention now because of the incredibly ridiculous display we saw from the Democrats um we have in mid term election coming up people should look at their behavior throughout the Kavanaugh confirmations as to how they would behave\nSo um we have in mid term election coming up people should look at their behavior throughout the Kavanaugh confirmations\nAs to how they would behave if they got control of the house and Senate there was a lot of chaos there was a lot of nonsense a lot of unnecessary things that happened a good man's name will never be the same um fortunately you know he's been confirmed to the Supreme Court\nBut um it wasn't you know without its trials and tribulations and um\nI was really appalled at at what we saw happen with that entire process because that's that's not how it's supposed to go but I think the reason that we see that happening is truly because the swamp is being drained and it's not going down without a fight\nI mean my father in law has opened up something in this country unlike anything we've ever seen you know he's exposed a\nA lot of people in Washington DC for going there and not doing the job they were supposed to do he's making them work he's calling people out and quite frankly I think it's about time I think a lot of people are very happy with what they've seen happen in this country since he took office and um\nYou know the the it scares people who who really aren't there for the right reasons and I think that's why you see all the vitriol and hatred towards him\nMore Trump joining us live on new a new start this team ... three twenty two is our time will continue to monitor the weather situation the weather in Council Bluffs you simply raining\nAs opposed to the severe weather and I'm looking at some pictures on the Internet now is Trump of the mid America center and there is a very long\nLine of folks with umbrellas and all sorts of rain gear waiting to see your father in law and died when he speaks congressman David Young will be on the podium and speak as well governor Kim Reynolds blows up relax and for weeks from today when you look and see these grounds that show up\nThen it really doesn't matter where we are talking about in the country we're talking about large large crowds and people waiting outside and all kinds of weather\nHas been surprised your father in law the president the the constant level of support or did he just since there was something there that he was going to be tapping into the lead to a victory almost two years ago\n[noise] well I I think it would be a lie to say that that didn't surprise him um you know I I think what happened is that he saw\nThat there was real change that needed to happen in this country he really did realize that he might be the only person to do this because remember he is not beholden to anyone he didn't take money from lobbyists he he ran his entire primary campaign and paid for it himself\nAnd that was something that was very important to him because he wanted the American people to understand that he was running for them not for any other reason I mean by all accounts\nMy father in law's life is probably a lot harder now\nThat he's president he could have had a great great life a great retirement been out playing golf than loved by the media in Hollywood like he always was before but\nHe chose to do this because he really understood what was happening in this country and then I think what happened was that a movement really formed behind him he was the leader of this incredible revolutionary movement in our country and it continues and I think it's so incredible as you pointed out that\nEvery single rally we have\nAnd we're having three and four rallies ... right now you know leading up to the mid term elections we continue to have\nWell over the the capacity crowd that we can ever put in in any of these spaces we have people that wait outside for hours in line with umbrellas in the heat in the snow in the rain whatever it is\nBecause they're so excited that they finally have a person in the oval office he was fighting for them and and I think this is a way that a lot of people want to say thank you to him and want to show their appreciation for everything that he has done um\nI I think it's incredible it never ceases to amaze me but I think it's because this country was so so ready for real change and for real fighter and and I think that's what's so many people have seen in my father in law\nThis is a question for which I'm not sure there's some answer asking her husband about it a few weeks ago but what are you surprised you all the most about him but surprise use most about this whole journey over the last three years from when he announced he was going to run for president\n[noise] well I Would I Would ... be lying if I said that any of us thought that we would have the amount of negativity thrown at us for that we have that that's certainly um\nHas been surprising in a lot of ways\nUm you know I just think for me seeing that the way the media honestly has gotten the sentiment of this country wrong um\nI can tell you that I was out on the campaign trail in two thousand sixteen and everywhere I went I Would call my husband 'cause we were never campaigning in the same place together so that would be too much too too much fun [laughter]\nUm well we we were always calling each other and saying oh my gosh why feel great I was just in Iowa today I was just in Florida North Carolina and the crowds we had were incredible and I think we're going to win this and then we come back to New York to change the closing our bad once a week\nAnd we come back and we turn on the TV and we'd be surrounded by the bubble that exist in New York City and in LA and we would say oh my gosh I don't know\nEvery time we were out on the road every time we were out with the real people of this country we knew that the media was missing something they did not reflect the sentiment of people in this country they still don't today and although the polls always showed that Donald Trump was behind that there was no path to victory\nI really knew that that he had a really good chance of winning solely based on my experiences out in the country and the feeling that I got from people so that to me has been been pretty shocking to see that\nThe way the media has been exposed for its bias and um I give my father in law a lot of credit for calling them out you know he likes to call it fake news but there really is something there and um it'll be interesting to see in the midterms how their predictions stack up to what actually happens\nWe're just got a couple of minutes left this is not a rule that you thought you were\nGoing to sign on for a trust no matter [laughter] no talking to people on the radio in Iowa and then on Fox News earlier this afternoon at ... ...\nWhat is it that you have learned from your background is usually North Carolina uh we're ... we're ... what did you learn about those of us here in the middle of the country the others in the Bible should learn\nWell I mean I Am from you know the the heart of this country I grow up in Wilmington North Carolina and\nMy parents are small business owners so a lot of what\nMy father in law talked about during the campaign resonated with me very well and then when I got to go travel up all across this country I heard stories from people about the fact that\nYou know they're living on Social Security and if they didn't live with their son they want to be able to afford insulin shots and you know the the real tragedy is in this country veterans who can barely get by and waiting in line for hours and hours or\nYou know for a simple appointment I mean I heard real stories from people\nYou get by and waiting in line for hours and hours\nOr you know first temple appointment I mean I heard real stories from people opioid and the way that it's impacted every segment of our society from the top to the very bottom and everywhere in between and\nIt it really you know you can't go out there and and hear people's stories inherit the way their their life\nCould be impacted by small changes and not move forward and not\nSay I'm going to fight for that and I'm going to fight for these people and not fly for me I Can't think of anything more important to do right now than to fight for my father in law and for his reelection and for the mid term to make sure Republicans get put in Congress because\nEverything that we've seen happen in this country thanks to Donald Trump is our president and all the incredible things the way the economy has turned around there were ... act we have on the world stage the possible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula I mean the the the number of things that have happened under hand are so staggering\nUh yeah we'll get the number here in a moment what was that Cory\nTwenty five miles per hour so slow down so I I Want to give you an accurate depiction of the a\nStorm itself and kind of when it's going to move through your area you want to let you know that whirlpool employees are being held as well I'm against the storm passes through the area's just to make sure that everything is a is fine for them to get out on the road as well and remember get on the road at these storms\nI'm you're really going to have to be watching very very carefully as well as those storms continue to move through because\nUm even if they're not severe they could contain some torrential rains and something we certainly need to watch for as all these storms move through just want to pull up the velocity proud of the kind of give you a better area to\nTo pinpoint of where that is\nUm how's it looking at them Ringo say cam right now\nSame story as it was earlier we can jump on a Mac to real quick here had this is a tornado warning extension that without into now\nWe're kind of moving its way north of the ... area and that's when it went up on next to that we're looking right now on the man on the ... city can't hear his name on ... or looking right now up towards the north and west towards that circulation\nAgain I had a history of producing a final before it has not produced anything additional since that point at least not that we've seen I Know that he was obstructed by trade earlier so\nCouldn't catch all the detail of it right now it's it's definitely something that I'm monitoring off towards the ah the right computer here\nI'm In addition to everything else that's been going on there came a close eye on that uh the Manchester City cam as well down there's been a tightening of the circulation too just off to the east of Manchester and they can kind of thing that I feel left hand side of the screen there than in fact kind of frightening guy off towards the ride darkening sky off towards the laugh\nYou get into Delaware county though and I just to the northeast of Manchester which would be close to the Oneida in Greeley areas which we talked about earlier [noise] ah that's right along highway thirty eight and a rotation literally between those two towns right now it's very close to the ... area perhaps right on top\nI'm up in the Clinton County there's also a secondary rotation approaching Oscar doc there is no formal warning for you [noise] um but there may be alluring in the cloud based in southern Clinton County as well\nTo be near the city of port as well ... to have pinpointed a storm moving across Ventura County out of northern Iowa county\nAnd put a storm track on that for your Blair's town of three forty nine van horn for all five\nEven at four twenty five ... park at four thirty one Vincent at four thirty two Urbana at four thirty seven Brandon at four fifty six of us will stay this form itself will stay west of the city of Cedar Rapids I moved to that northern storm in Clinton County\nUm and take a look at that as well because it was pointed that out a bit earlier it looks like there's a pretty good rotation in the storm in southern areas of Clinton County to send me ...\nAnd ... are very very close to that area and there would be north of Delaware county is that storm continues to move off to the north or fish a warning in effect as of right now but\nWe're watching the ... very very carefully again areas of northern Delaware county that tornado warning still continues watch and are Manchester City can not seeing anything as far as the lowering of the clouds not quite as evidence was earlier\nI'm watching very carefully though to see if there could be something that would drop out of that storm in addition to sell of concern right now we're going to help poor an Oscar doc\nI'm moving is off to the north closer to thirty five miles per hour I'm with that you could certainly see some rotations woman I'm surprised yet I'm that we've seen a warning out on that storm as it moves off toward the north\nYeah that rotations quite strong there over southeast\nSections of Clayton County I'm just around and just to the west of the astronauts\nThe last toward the north yeah that rotations quite\nStrong there over southeast actions as Clinton County I'm just around and just to the west of the ... area yeah that's that's between ... port and between Oscar doc right in the center there are there is a fair amount of rotation that is happening there and I know it's not formally\nOn the news is
