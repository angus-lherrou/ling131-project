Dick Tracy on Eliot Ness and now this is a fairly important historical footnote that had never been noted and so that even feel my interest in MS more a\nBrad ... who who lived in Michigan at the time began reading my books when he was in his teens and I kept him sometimes because the those are not really books\nDesigned for Thirteen year old readers but if you're precocious your precocious\nAnd he began finding his way to book signings of of mine he and his parents were taken from Michigan to Chicago where I Would frequently do book signings because of the Chicago aspects of of my novels\nHe also traveled to Des Moines to see the play Eliot Ness and untouchable life which is a one man show button ask that I wrote\nAnd then later became a a a TV movie essentially on PBS\nAnd he came to that and and then he showed up at the next signing in Chicago with with with a T shirt you know he bought a bought it the play and he he with his historical bent\nAnd as he got into ... we stayed in touch and we became friends and as he got into college and was a history major\nHe kept at me about where we should do the definitive book on Eliot Ness sent an Al Capone together I'm this story and and your you know you're a storyteller and well we can we've or to talents together\nAnd I said well I've really done everything I Need to do on Eliot Ness I've written you know for a novel these been and a bunch of other novels of mind as a secondary character\nAnd I've done this one man play I don't need to do do a book well the\nUm since then we're back into the fifties an overall it's been a pretty nice afternoon across our area again the biggest part of the weather story as we move our way forward is not necessarily an precipitation though there were a few scattered sprinkles earlier I think it's mainly on the wind that's going to be coming in by the time we get to Sunday\nLast weekend on Saturday I think we had some ghosts in eastern Iowa fifty fifty five miles an hour so not that bad but you're still gonna feel it pretty much sustained at one twenty five and thirty\nMhm yeah in fact that we're just about to get a a blog pushed out to the or the afternoon update here or what we look at it as we look at air pressure across the state of Iowa and an old Iowa State university rule that we picked up\nIs when you look at the air pressure difference across the state and the state just happens to be a perfect shape and perfect size for every formula bars of air pressure difference it's about a ten mile an hour wind\nAnd so worried about ten Mila bars difference on Sunday which equates to about twenty five mile an hour wind sustained\nAnd the typical rule for gusts patter like this is generally about double nearly double of what your sustain speeds are so hence guts of\nAt least over forty and hopefully not over fifty but uh I Would think just seem to forty five is not out of the realm of possibility here um it looks like it's almost the same hours this last weekend about nine o'clock to about three o'clock and then things are going to shut down real quick and then over all leave us with really pleasant conditions on Sunday night into Monday\nChance of rain is not tremendous but give us a sense of where the the best chance for any measurable precipitation maybe as we go into the weekend sure there's going to be\nTwo windows of time here there may be a little bit of light rain one is late tonight probably after football time into the very early morning hours of our Saturday north of highway twenty\nSouth of there not much at all and even north of twenty tonight's going to be really really isolated stuff second window of opportunity is going to be later on Saturday Night if you have any evening events or activity Saturday That's fine\nAfter midnight is probably going to be the prime time to start looking for some rain during northwest to start to push through our same midnight to\nEight midnight the seven AM on Sunday is the second window of time so as you can see from both of these chances it's mainly at night when we're not going to be doing much we're talking late overnight early morning hours and the vast majority of us are asleep\nSo are these windows the time are are pretty favorable actually if we're going to have any rain fall in the fall and a again a situation where things that could be really life we're talking less than a tenth of an inch show you really shouldn't slow down any harvest progress across theory it should be enough water to cause any issues\nSo give us a sense then laser ring in on the next thirty six hours if you will it\nPretty good for football tonight I'm shouldn't be too much cooler than mid to upper forties during these games and the overall should be okay and mix of clear sky and cloud coverage across our area probably more clouds farther north\nAnd if we do get a shower the really late in the Knight far northeast Iowa only down to forty to furlough tonight and then all the way up to fifty nine degrees for tomorrow should be an excellent excellent late October day for your Saturday and all the while the wind is not going to do much it's light from the northeast currently light from the south east tonight light from the south tomorrow\nThen it starts to pick up has to go into Sunday and again the window of opportunity for the strongest winds probably nine AM to three PM\nAh we'll see if it comes in slightly sooner but the bottom line is it's going to be windy on Sunday and again some of those guests over forty miles an hour looks like that's a slam dunk for the cedar valley next week ought to be pretty decent overall one day in their brain early on on Tuesday\nAnd then still looking pretty good for trick or treating around the area on Wednesday tide and the low fifties and an early look a trick or treat weather for that evening\nI'd say upper forties to low fifties is probably pretty reasonable was a pretty like wind so I'd say all in all it's it's definitely not the warmest extended but at the same time October can be much much colder than this so we'll take we can get which it looks dry and and okay for the middle of next week\nAnd I don't have any goals and goblins at home that will be trick or treating but I did notice that the beggars night soon the cedar valley really run the gamut it's not just one of the way back to the day and so we'll have to watch that when Tim talks due Monday morning at seven thirty five\n[noise] All right sounds good the only thing I'd watch for as if there is a night there on Tuesday that one might be wet um otherwise bolt Monday and Wednesday ought to be okay Jeff adapt your costumes according depending on what not you're going\nHave a good weekend guy yes you do see benign meteorologist Kyle

traffic traffic has on and on the third degree felony another parking violation misdemeanors recently ... how's this guy not in prison\nHe's committed multiple felonies but here's a bigger question for you ladies and gentlemen\nAnd this was sent to me by a buddy of mine\nThe New York times and other news outlets keep referring to this guy is a registered Republican right\n\nBut he's previously been convicted of felonies according to their same store in these other stores\nThey registered Republican right\nBut he's previously been convicted of selling these according to their same store and these other stores so he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote in Florida\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states in the blue cities they keep pushing for the rights of felons to vote after they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're heard Gillum mentioned it and one of the debates summer even pushing for the ride of felons to vote while they're in prison\n\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nHe should've been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the ride of felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it soon Mike by the way they go so left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Arnie of ironies to do exactly that\nSo unless he had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I Would ask the news media out there the New York slime the constipated news network MSL us they all have you\nVery beautiful multi

elect Andrew Gillum got\n\nMay stores will stand up and said that we can stand up for the values of it\nAnd the values of the community is to trash the cops even in the face of this\nThat's a press conference today\nAnd they want Debbie Wasserman Schultz to know that she's a victim\nThat her staff Herseth victims\nBut so it was Donald Trump junior victim and so is Eric Trump a victim and so it was Donald Trump of victim and so it was Laura trauma victims and so was Marco Rubio victim and sewers Susan Collins a victim and so as General Mattis a victim\n\nAnd I just don't remember all the outpouring of anguish by the media I just don't remember it day in and day out\n\nNow this isn't about moral relativism ever anything of this or this is about absolute mold face bully ten hypocrisy\n\nAnd Steve ... was actually shot and almost murdered as others were shot\n\nLuckily this cook either didn't know what he was doing or didn't intend for these bombs to go either way he's a terrorist and the New York times tells us he's a registered Republican I'm trying to figure out how that can be I'm not saying he's not I just want to know more\nBecause once you're a felon and Florida you're not automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically to the floor like clemency board did he do that\nDid he get approval I mean this guy in two thousand two\nIn two thousand two he made a bomb threat [noise] he made a bomb threat in two thousand two he's not a clean slate\n\nThe way he was worth the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric and whoever was doing this\nThat was the insinuation that pushed him over the edge and that this is what causes this sort of know it doesn't that has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh long before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States\nHe was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place project or discharge any destructive devise\n\nAnd as pointed out in the Washington Examiner he made the bomb threat because he\nWas angry at a Florida utility worker seeing people do not make these threats\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum medical you intrusive Andrew Gillum\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy clubs or anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make\nThe guy he'll be more you know community relations more community relations\nI tell you what\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would not from a conspiracy prospect or anything else just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slime so washing compost the constipated news network MSL us the and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that and I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first report\nIs to tell us how [noise]\nWas because Florida [noise]\nIs not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is because uh [noise]\nPeople on the Florida clemency board game as registration at what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that someone should be able to vote and\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you just created nitric\nDown why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we ever live and number two if not if we have a regular American\n\nMike in Maryland and the great WMA I'll go\nPay Martin great talking to you a dime color on ... on a war of rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed the same to push the buttons to push a guy but what is that\nUm you know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate has been directly or ... or attacked\nAnd attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's insulting to people when they when they picked up by and then there are in fact by the fact\nThat my voice is the you know they're going back and forth but at the end the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it showed threatens to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the\nDemocrats I think I think you're giving this not way too much credits or in two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the left hands that this has uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't and I don't support that at all it's more of that case though you know you're you're asking why do we push the buttons why go there anyway why ever fact orders that doesn't have the right way to do face or the way we're fed up\nWhile the media like to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr Zucker over to CNN and uh the clown that runs MSL us they they've decided that they are political operations in that they want to um [noise]\nUh they want they want to play to a base the radical left coup Democrat base and that's what they've decided to do\nOr they're not really news operations

number for let's just let's let them call different shows I'm not interested in that that go to a Todd Rockville, Maryland WCBS and go\nTo mark great to talk to you that you can I have here's one solution I haven't done the math on this and it's\nPretty incredible you and I and everybody else pay into Social Security trust fund or about what is it six point eight percent seven point two percent on your way out or fail how about we Institute for near citizenship in this country for a period of four years you've paid double that rate\nAnd then you work your way to sort of friendship and you're right comes down to a normal right I just the math on an\nAllegory let let let's let you see there's a moral issue here so I don't think people should be able to pay their way out of the illegal behavior\nOr not somebody and and watch\nAll also sees because many of them are and very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook\nWhat I'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax it will of such already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how do how do you push them into that system\nWhile I'm thing even for legal immigration coming to this country we gotta have something going instead\nOf why we need is to limit the number of people coming into the country legally and illegally that's it\nLike this is not Nineteen Eighteen if ... if the new ball game I don't know what that means I mean it's the new economy we can't lawyer by the same than\nThe Nineteen twenties during college is presidency we had a during that period before and slightly after we had like a twenty year respite on immigration you aware of that\nI Wish it was to some extent\nOr a matter of us being able to just slow things down assimilate people within our system to take a look at how such shaking out in terms of our school systems\nIn terms of law enforcement terms a local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but what's happening is the left is flooding the field more and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never in American history\nAnd we actually have a political party that cheering illegality\nFifty year period of immigration like we have right now never an American history and we actually have a political party that cheering illegality cheering\nSo I I I don't but I appreciate your call people come up with tax schemes and everything else that's beyond tax games it's beyond well let's have them pay three times and no no\nThat's an forced the law\nThat's in force the law and many people who come here people don't want to
