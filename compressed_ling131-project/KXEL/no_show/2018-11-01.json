campaigns now that is a lie ladies and gentlemen no he doesn't\nThat is a lie this is what she does she lives\nThat's what she does\n\nIn my view just mind is the most important gubernatorial campaign out there is in Florida\nWith Ron descent as a constitutional conservative a combat veteran\n[noise] important race in Georgia and we're in other radical has been nominated important race in Kansas where you have Kobach who was a terrific candidate you need to pay attention to this [noise] and uh Wisconsin\n\nYou have a great governor in Wisconsin Walker\n\nAnd he's in the fight of his political career you were in the fighting your political career\nThis was very very important\nAt least I Know it is and you know it is to\nSay these are some of the ... and if I miss some that's perfectly fine I'm not a pretending to be a ... to recall of them this is these are some of the very very important Senate races that are taking place that we have an opportunity to truly when\n\nWe love Chris McDaniel in Mississippi as many of you know he's running for the Senate there is an actual conservative by the way to real conservative\n\nSo that's very important race and we like Patrick Morrisey very much in West Virginia against mantra\n\nMany you folks in West Virginia remember mansion as your governor well I Want you to think about 'em as your senator 'cause he's been awful\nHope throw vote here and there but you need better than that\nNew one better than that I think now we have all these house races I Can't possibly get into all of them I Would say this in Huntington Beach California have\nDinner Rohrabacher not only agree with Dana Rohrabacher on everything but I can tell you this\nHe's a good man he's oregano I remember when he and I worked in the Reagan White house together he was a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan [noise] he's in the fight of his career [noise] now do you really want some left wing cook to represent you\nYour other races in California about seven of them and the Democrats are hoping he went all seven so they can take the house and I can assure you that the media if it's close or they're going to be pushing these races all through the night\n\nTo try and influence the outcomes in California for a Republican you know live in one of these districts you must not give up your must vote\n\nYou must vote so a lot of important races in California\n[noise] they got a big race for governor in Oregon\nThey might actually get a Republican governor the first one in forty years can you imagine that but there's big races all over the country look in my state the commonwealth of Virginia we've got Dave Brat so what they did the Democrats as they found a former CIA employee who is a left wing cook\n\nBut she keeps campaigning on the fact that she is a former CIA employee\n\nBecause of the left is many of them trying to cover their trail they can try and cover what they really are and who they really are she will vote to impeach the president of the United states and Dave Brat as a member of the Freedom Caucus is crucially important that's an important race\nWe're Barbara Comstock in northern Virginia she's the only Republican left in northern Virginia she's it and she's being targeted by the gun control crowd Bloomberg she's being targeted by a pillow see pack and all the left as they want to take her down\nOf course conservatives have been disappointed with summer her positions\nBut\nTheir choices between her and the biggest tax or ... or in modern times in the state Senate Virginia\n...\nTo also voted to impeach Trump so I urge my love in I turn these different districts that turned out\n\nAnd vote for Comstock and the vote for some of these other candidates\n\nYou need some of these rhinos in order to win this is a more you clean out the rhinos you clean out the rhinos in Republican primaries\nBut we have certain candidates in New York New Jersey\nAnd the Supreme Court a Pennsylvania controlled by the Democrats you know what they did these low down slowly\nNew Jersey and the Supreme Court a Pennsylvania controlled by the Democrats you know what they did these low down Sony justice is\nNot too long ago a few months ago they completely redistricted state but Democrats which may in fact\nIf you don't turn out all over the country including in Pennsylvania in the house to the Democratic party this was when it goes on with these Obama judges says what goes on with these democratic judges when these the state Supreme Court [noise]\nThe Supreme Court gerrymandered congressional districts in Pennsylvania it out but Democrats [noise]\nI'll be right back with a tremendous gas\nFor years I've been sleeping on my Casper mattress I'd take it over every mattress I ever had it helps me get the best night's sleep period and once you try Caspar you're going to love yours to\nI mean let's face it onto the Iraq Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels\nI get up and I said no to that nonfat but I've followed those lawsuits and President Trump well he's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump has done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia we need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes\nAnd then ultimately deregulating so that regulations fulfill a more basic purpose mark is you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either individually\nOr within our communities on the local level\nWhen you have federal regulations in place there has to be a very compelling health safety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the Obama era\nOr they went so far beyond the pale President Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote in the U.S shut it would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people West Virginia [noise] they need to understand that when Hillary Clinton and her bunch talked about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens\nOf West Virginia to me one of the Democrats done in the last forty years for coal miners I Can't think of a single sooner than trying to put them out of work\nA look I think the biggest thing is when you of a presidential nominee who says we're not put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work\nYou might be able to say oops and try to take it back but the people West Virginia don't forget that's one of the major reasons why Joe mansions going down that is true self\nThrough the fact is that Joe mansion vice president president right he's here when you don't need him he's never going to lead a certainly not going to stand together with President Trump\nAnd that's why more and more people as they're examining the contrast between my campaign\nAnd Joe mansion coming over to our side that's why we're tied or maybe I'll buy one and the latest poll we feel very good but I have to tell you um are we have to get the word out because Chuck Schumer and the coastal elites Bloomberg and Soros and all these radicals they're coming in and they're spending\nUnbelievable money we think it's going to be over twenty five million West Virginia most expensive state in the country per capita in the Senate electric\nPatrick Morrisey if America wants to donate to your campaign that the people of West Virginia want to turn out and supported the grassroots level what is your website\nOr our website is Patrick Morrisey dot com and that's to ours and want to ask since the folks consider donating twenty five dollars right now you'd make a difference we know that Schumer the other day just dumped seven hundred thousand more money in\nThe Democratic Senatorial Committee ... born today we're fighting like check in the arena and we're going to win but you know how we're going to win win win through these grassroots patriots that are listening to you mark\nUp people care about the constitution people care about the rule of law the separation of powers that's what I've been all about as the state attorney general West Virginia that's how I'm going to act in the U.S Senate buddy Patrick Morrisey dot\nCom to ours won't ask please twenty five dollars here twenty five dollars there the limits twenty seven hundred we need to fight that Schumer mansion Clinton team because they've got the money but we've got the ...\nThe limits twenty seven hundred we need to fight that Schumer mansion Clinton team out because they've got the money but we've got the heart and we have a Trump Card\nAnd you know what if we can get two Republican senators out of West Virginia given what the Democrats have done to your state it's going to be very very tough so uh I Hope the folks in West Virginia understand when mansion comes home and he smiles when he shakes hands any\nAny kind of doesn't Lincoln ... about the liberals in Congress and so when he votes with them Ninety eight percent of the time so I'm\nAn on these big votes you gotta sit breathless lay on the edge of your chair and wonder if he's going to come through or not as he's trying to figure out what is best for his his political career I assumed Patrick you're going to take a leading role defending your stay you're going to take a leading role as a conservative\nWe are mark and and I appreciate you saying that as attorney general we helped lead a lot of these national challenges which stood against illegal amnesty and we were very strong we took on that rock Obama EPA\nTime after time I look we say no to this piece the nonsense that comes out of a laugh I mean what they did is absolutely outrageous and anyone who says the Joe ... only voted for Kavanaugh they have to look back at one point\nDo you know that all of the shenanigans and the obstruction resistant circus but we saw could have been avoided\nIf Joe mansion at stepped out earlier instead of taking a powder when they called his name per se so let me can wait for the state of Maine Susan Collins to pass the deciding vote\nThat's a profound cowardice and that's not going to be my approach on the exact opposite [noise]\nAll right Patrick Morrisey I Wish you all the best I obviously support your effort very very strongly and give out your Web site again
