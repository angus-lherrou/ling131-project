Campbell and every single time they're able to go toe to toe and I expect that to be the case in against West Virginia and I think it's going to be a really fun game with the ... the crowd and the you know once you get onto the light the jak to our stadium you never know what's happened [noise]\nAnd that place is going to be rock and Jerry should be a really fun environment in one of the keys I thought Saturday was just a pressure that was Don Cornelius he was running for his life all day I mean there were seven ... sixteenth tackles for last how important will be to get that same pressure on West Virginia quarterback will Greer\nYeah for sure I mean obviously well here's one of the best quarterback from the country for a reason these are the highest candidate for a reason right now and a missing him uncomfortable is going to really important for our ...\nUh he's got a couple of receivers you know and David cells and uh and the other guy's name slip through my mind right now but you know their offices as good as anybody\nYou're going to find a cross college football in the defense is pretty damn good as well and uh you know being a figure out a way to to make a little uncomfortable fortunate and maybe make some mistakes that other teams haven't been able to do so far this year in crucial and uh it's going to be all about trying to create extra positions for our state and um you know take some possessions away for\nFrom West Virginia so I think that is a big piece of the game\nOr I expect them to to bring some crush or maybe not quite the same level if they get they did against Oklahoma State because that was a uncharacteristic amount of pressure brought by John Hitchcock's defense but\nUh I still think that they'll they'll be able to do it and you know they've got the horses up front on the defensive line and then in the line back in court and you know even Brian ... came up with a psych on Saturday from the quarterback spot so\nYou know there's a lot of guys that are able to rush the passer and and I was just going to need to come up there on Saturday [noise]\nJared before we let you go just anything else from from a covering and following the Iowa State when over Oklahoma State that or you want to share with us any other things that you noted coming off that big when\nUm I mean I think the really the the biggest thing to me that is kind of a a an interesting takeaways just when you look across the board at Iowa State scheme how many of these guys are\nStill going to have a lot of time left to play football you know uh I think I read in the game does that twenty two of the twenty nine starters that I Wish they put on the field on Saturday work or not seniors only seven seniors on the starting lineup and\nWhen you're you know you've got a guy like rock party and they've Montgomery and all of the office of climate will be back next season all their ... for the most part we back next even outside of ...\nUh both of the backup running backs are all three of the active running backs I suppose we'll be back next season everybody along the defensive line everybody in the line backing core outside of Willie Harvey and\nEverybody in the safety group so you don't have to replace your two quarterbacks and then you're basically your number too wide receiver going into next year so\nUh [laughter] that makes you feel pretty good about the future of our states program than if they can continue to have some success then you know I think that uh this year can continue to be really fun and uh to shape up to be an even more fun to doesn't Nineteen [noise]\nExcellent stuff Jared thanks for joining us today and recapping a big role when for Iowa State football forty eight forty two over Oklahoma State they were ranked ... in the country when I was the beat him in Stillwater on Saturday\nBall forty eight forty two over Oklahoma State they were ranked ... in the country when I was state beat him in Stillwater on Saturday thanks Jared\nThe bishop and goes German cycling fanatic that I'm Talking about that big when speaking to David Montgomery though now that doesn't go to the NFL next year and there's an aunt who keep butler those two for the NFL those are some pretty big boys in the\nRight now it's ...

Panthers a ... they gave up too many yards of off ... to North Dakota state but\nA mall against do does a really neat special where however many yards of ... the Panthers to give up to their opponent that's how much your second pizza is on Monday\nAt Mali against good for dining only and and still a a a second pizza just five dollars and twenty three cents is is a pretty good deal we'd much rather have it be two fifty or three tan or three eighty five five twenty three still a good deal it's just we don't want to give up that many yards of our fence to your opponent that's a great\nDeal when it comes to pizza but it's a bad deal when it comes to washing your your your football defense on the field and that's what happened to many yards equals too many points and uh\nYeah it was it was rough to watch it they weren't big enough in the middle North Dakota states office of line was exactly what you kind of expected dominant and we just we just couldn't hang in there it it was rough to watch the last\nSix minutes ... brutal but but the the uh\nThe first what forty five and nine the first fifty four minutes of that game that was a game that was a good football game it couldn't start it any better for you and I know it it could not have started any fifty six seconds into the ball game\nYou and I wins the toss against the number one ranked team in the country defending national champion winters of six of the last seven national titles the Panthers when the toss instead of putting their defense on the field they say we want the ball first and I like that will take the ball you and I takes the football in\nFifty six seconds into the game they do this\nGame doesn't air side McCain [noise] foot wide left with costs either get a get fake it and then\nWant to start that there's one for the panther\nI Try to run by the key to that started it off and now we're going to stay 'cause they were not going to let them on the football I like that they brought everybody up here a little pressure package pay the price there 'cause safety came and did not they'd rather more relief just a little scene Rob I'd rather more done all kinds of the time to throw it in there well designed play\nThree point eight Seventy five yard touchdown scoring drive to start the game and the Panthers go up seven to nothing uh and then the Panthers get a defensive stopped they get the football right back now on this drive they had to start at their own a yard line\nTo be able to our three thirty or so you'll probably get it up the enemy about three ... three forty five ... passed up in its entirety what what are you got for us today I'll look\nForward to well ah you know a first off I checked in a couple of times on the panther game in the first half in early in the third quarter and I thought hey this is great and I was shocked to hear the final uh\nIt got away from it yeah uh so anyways or a film bounce back they're they're good or in this weekend they can kind of put themselves back on the math\nYes all of this and that and but uh I just have to say you know or maybe you know sometimes\nYou get to stretch and then after you've really stretched out everything then you can operator or move or play basketball or whatever and it seems like last week in\nThe Iowa State got to finally stretch it out offensively and defensively and now they've got the kinks out I Believe and look out I'm I'm looking for big things from either party or camp too could be back\nAnd what do you what do you do Marty Marty you're the head coach for for the next minute you gotta you gotta healthy Kyle camp he's he's ready to go you got Brock purdie who's the national freshmen of the week do you did things that\nA quarterback hasn't done at Iowa State it as a freshman I think ever in years who do you start the start purdie or do you do you go back to Kyle camp ...\nI think a couple of things you read your team you see where their moods or you don't ask him out right but you just kind of see where their moods are and then you pass the coaches are their opinions on it and then you call ... ... and and you say ...\nYou know you're the man a and this is how the team feels right this moment you know do you want to you think you know you can step back in there or do we want to play this party thing out a little bit and\nGo from there and I think camp would be very honest about that mhm uh I was reading how their quarterbacks just really work together and support each other and I really think they do\nBut you know trials are a great player and I don't think we would miss a beat except the run game and that might even across south or West Virginia because who's going to start and there are two different our fence of uh the way they operate when are\nThe two different quarterbacks are in there so you know maybe play 'em both shark camp 'cause you know an injury shouldn't cost and the start and then uh you know just every couple of series change him out to see which works best against West Virginia I I Know they got an offer fans but I'm a I'm not\nAll up on West Virginia having a great great defense they did give up a twenty two points to Kansas so who knows I\nHeard in the ... good assessment by you Marty pretty good [laughter] ... ... ... ... as a fan Marty you would be okay if ... out there you wouldn't be a little disappointed ... pretty didn't take the first half of guess West Virginia\nNo not in the middle east or that\nI wouldn't I wouldn't have four hundred and four totally guards often you don't want to ride the hot hand against the number six team in the country\nWhere I'm just saying you start trial because you know it'd be injuries shouldn't costs to start and just kind of see how they did that yeah\nThey did that was the other quarterback and uh he wasn't getting to get that done and so you you're pulling purdie and or you go if it shows because they didn't do it but if he'd marches right down to feel like going to hand\nOut you've ... you've got you've got a good problem you've got to know lead to really good quarterbacks an ... said no one still has some things he can offer to but you you know if campus healthy\nAh and with ... Brock purdie did now yeah I mean if somebody's off a little bit you just you can roll the other guy out there and and uh I I think it's a it's a good problem to ...\nYou know one thing I got to say I was watching a pretty throw the ball you must have big hands number one he was throwing that ball almost like a baseball player\nA it was you know you didn't have to aim it or anything just I mean if you get a chance to see him just look how he throws it he he doesn't you know hold it back there were two hands and pass the ball like a lot of quarterbacks to he just gets it back there in the wings\nYou into a it was just a a little contrast in the quarterback style so I I don't have any\nProblem with Jared Jared stansberry cycling fanatic that come I think he told us in high school in Arizona ... through for like five thousand yards or something so ... he can throw any senior year in the ... yeah ... yeah I mean that's just that's that's unreal\nEnrique you're from your marred okay I got to go get it came to Iowa State play quarterback and I like that [laughter] that's right All right thank you\nYou're from your Marta okay I got to let you go ... came to Iowa State play

catch before he got hit going into the end zone welcome\nBack to a Monday edition of on press role with the sports guy I'm Gary ... alongside our co host Chris doping ... the sports or chase Daniel center in Studio producer for the network that touchdown\nWas the one that came on the very final play of the third quarter the gave you an I delete thirty one twenty eight after the Panthers fallen behind twenty eight twenty four to North Dakota state up three going into the fourth and final quarter against the defending national champions Chris\nDodd like where you're sitting don't you what what more can you ask for it you go into the fourth quarter with a lead you had the lead at halftime thanks would Austin earth a field goal you're playing well your officers click and\nI I don't know you just you feel good to fans felt good I'm sure you felt good I felt pretty good obviously we need North Dakota state was going to make a charge which we found out they definitely did we how can you not feel good going for\nAfter that touched down to thirty one twenty eight we felt good but on the very first play from scrimmage to start the fourth quarter that's when stick hooked up with Bruce Anderson on that Seventy five yard touchdown pass play where he just kind of swung out of the backfield and\nWas wide open and eleven seconds end of the fourth quarter the vice and regained elite thirty five thirty one and that's where the momentum\nShifted you know going into the fourth quarter panther fans were going crazy the team was feeling good I mean after Dionne machine scored that touchdown everybody went nuts on the sideline I thought the whole unit don't want to ... went nuts besides all the green and yellow that was in there which could still makes you a little upset that they travel so well but respect to them for that and then\nYou you mentioned eleven seconds in it all changes and all the momentum went to North Dakota state because who expected the defense to go out there and then all of a sudden give up at a Seventy five hundred past or the\nPanthers could not stop the rushing attack of North Dakota state the two headed monster a Bruce Anderson an alliance done two hundred and Seventy four yards between those two guys quarterback eastern stick added thirty five\nOther third string tail back Adam Cole field at at twenty five yard touchdown run North Dakota state amassed three hundred and forty four yards\nOn the ground they came in averaging like two Seventy four per game so they're known for a great rushing attack but the Panthers ended up\nAllowing them three hundred and forty four yards on the ground they average seven point two yards per running play way too much I asked coach Farley today at a press conference what went wrong coach Farley in the Russian\nDefense against that North Dakota state ... its cut K\nBoy did we didn't get off the box\nWhich is that we just didn't get off [noise] we we didn't get off the box we needed to get off and and uh we didn't make tackles in space coming off the secondary so those two things put together a\nWendy's spit outside and spit down the sideline we didn't make the play but they was handed out for the most part inside his when he when he broke the perimeter that's where we didn't make the play\nCorrect as all by me or is it safe for sale change as well be\nThat we'll we'll find out if it's correct to bowl and and what we'll do this week so ah yeah that's\nThe one running back was very good you know he was he was a player eight and ... and I'm very good but it wasn't so he has shifted breakaway speed like I just said he had to have birth to him [noise] ah but ah but other than that it's just\nIt's just taking care of ourselves into in taking care of our assignments that it's all there I'm not [noise]\nWe'll figure it out\nThis way to put them\nAnd we talked about number eight he was talking about Bruce Anderson the starting running back for North Dakota state twenty three carries a hundred and Seventy yards a seven point for yards carrying yeah he's pretty\nGood it makes you want to throw up when he lived just I mean three hundred and forty four yards rushing for touchdowns they average seven point two\nYards per carry that just it's it's brutal and he's absolutely right that didn't get off blocks and nobody filled the whole it seemed like North Dakota state was open in a hole for ill for running backs to run through a nobody filled the hole and it was frustrating and something that's definitely going to need to get corrected because or going to face a few more running teams the season a couple of more\nRated teams yet to have to face all take a look at the latest rankings in a moment uh I I ask coach Farley also what his press conference today after meeting with the team yesterday in going over the game film of the last of North Dakota state what's what was the mood of the\nTeam coming off that game on Saturday when they met with the the team yesterday it's cut Jay\n... uh probably I don't know what the mood of the team was but when you go back and watch the tape [noise]\nYou know that's the way are often play dolphins played very very well put it very well special teams play very well that was a heck of a well game against both the uh\nGet some of the young women radio so it wasn't such miniscule you're looking at thirty five thirty one and it was an all out for all and I think is the first time\nAnd some of the women radio so it wasn't six minutes ago you're looking at thirty five thirty one and it was an all out for all and I think it's the first time\nI noticed the first time we square thirty one points against them I don't think they've been scored against as it was like does the Fifteen somewhere in there so it's been a while so that was a back and forth battle that way for whatever reason and so it wasn't like you were going to go in and be upset about the game\nWas correcting but we did wrong on defense because we had a chance with the with the waiver plan off and civilians specialties wise that we could have [noise]\nWith a defense lawyer we normally face with him kept him and check but they could say the same thing too because they usually that's usually a twenty four Twenty one game at the end of the day and that's what the score was at halftime [noise]\nSo it was quite a flip side of what even expected going into the game or what was going to occur on both sides of the ball [noise]\nGotta agree with coach Farley it was a heck of a game it really was I mean it got away in the fourth quarter but we're still over a six minutes left to play it was a thirty five thirty one score anybody's game\nThe Panthers gave North Dakota state all they want it in that game and the bikes and just ah found a way to to pull it out in the end let's quick recap what happened in the Missouri Valley football conference over the weekend Youngstown State picked up their first conference one of the year they beat southern Illinois Seventeen fourteen\nIllinois state got a a big hole when they took care of western Illinois thirty three sixteen\nAnd the team to the un I Panthers have to play this Saturday in Vermillion South Dakota the south Dakota ... Missouri state thirty five twenty eight it was a goal line stain Missouri\nState had the football third goal at the one she's third in the one down seven with a about a minute and a half to go and could not punch it in in South Dakota got the victory thirty five\nTwenty eight or South Dakota state I I still just as we were checking on that score Saturday Night I just couldn't believe it Indiana State\nTook South Dakota state to overtime shocking where was it an older drains or was it it was in Brookings South Dakota and South Dakota states home field\nFifty four fifty one South Dakota state wins it in overtime over Indiana State\nUh ... I think and and I hope it doesn't happen to you and I but I think it has something to do with that hangover after playing North Dakota state if you remember North Dakota state in South Dakota state played a week ago in a in a really good football game also it tight game that North Dakota state prevailed in\nOne sixty or so there's a lot of different things within the same Matt so\nUs you know really coming out with a game plan as not going to be probably beneficial threat because we're going to come with a game plan and they are going to have a totally different might not so\nProud of robbing Peterson the volleyball coach for you and I was talking about tonight told match hosting Evansville again you'll hear live right here on news ...

go pick up a copy yet deeply appreciative alright getting\nBack to the most important thing of the day the big win and the big el we dropped on the liberals this weekend there was a rule number two then that take away from this there is no appeasing liberals are the law\nStop it stop stop member as soon as he powdered members in powder stopping me forever without the shore to stop\nThe insanity there is no appeasing the left there will be no appeasing of the left I got to have to be at her which is a conservative review for this when he had a great piece out that I\nThere is no appeasing these people\nAny Republican out there listening who thinks they're buying some kind of like political chats chips where the seat folks chips you know like the the poker chips anyone who thinks they're getting some kind of like building up a political bank account political capital with the left\nUp on the hill and I'm a bipartisan guy around my bipartisan gal and\nI cross the aisle and I'm voting against in title for reform and against tax cuts and the media will love me David shall we feel good luck to you know they don't love you and they have ... they will turn on you in a minute just like they turned on she was in college now\nListen thank you to Susan college she took a great vote I think people are going overboard that's what they elected him to do but seriously thank you I don't want to be again Debbie Downer on this thing but\nThis is what Republicans elected she was in college to do advance Republican causes it's not a mystery that's why we have a party a party with a unified set of ideas and the collective ideology that that that's the bedrock principles there's a lot of differences under the tent but there's some staple\nThings freedom liberty and these are the things Kavanaugh stood for but what happened\nIs Susan Collins is weak and after she took the I after she announced it would be a vote for a cabinet and essentially put them over the top the left immediately responded on Twitter although she's on their side on a lot of social issues uh uh on on on a lot of a matter of fact not just social issues on a lot of issues she's on their side and she's been a hero for bipartisanship\nThey immediately called or what a rape apologist one of the most disgusting filthy things you can slow or someone with on social media in the media or anywhere there is no appeasing these people they can't stand the folks I'm Sorry\nI'm not talking about your neighbor the Democrat guy you know who you're chatting with a ... I'm not suggesting you should start like a cold civil war in your neighborhood I'm telling you the radical left\nTheir media cronies and these swamp brat Democrats they are not going to find a redeeming characteristic with you ever the minute\nYou vote against your finished\nSo stops collectively shining their foods [noise]\nStop surgically attaching your lifted their plus it's not going to work they do care there is no appeasing these people sat take away a number\nOf all of a matter of fact it could be ...\n... you know we're far from and give us all he says\nListen to what David asked for Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nThat now calling them a racist wasn't good enough we had to replace the sea with a P\nDisgusting\nBut since they decided to do that\nLadies and gentlemen the left blue for themselves and opportunity\nAct the law school appearances the accolades the awards you can't very well sit and believe me I'm not suggesting this was a good idea this was discussing what they did to him\nBut you can reasonably assume at this point that sadly Kavanaugh will be probably protest it for the rest of his life\n\nIf Kavanaugh other family is listening at all God Bless you brother for sticking in there and fighting the good fight you have made enormous sacrifices and I listen I met anybody preach or anything but I I and I hate quotes because people always use quotes when they have nothing good to say themselves but I I Can't say this one enough\nBernard ... and the natural you know the the book that they didn't mean to a movie right ... story\nWhen he says you know the half the true happiness is through suffering you know we all live to live one you learn from in ... and the one you live after that\nKavanaugh is done with life number one the one he learned from he learned what the left will do that\nNow he's living the life after that and he's figuring out that the path to true happiness and accomplishment is going to be through suffering and sadly folks I mean this from the bottom of my heart sadly cabin on his family are going to suffer the rest of their lives just like Clarence Thomas and his family have suffered for the rest of their life\nThese are sterling individual Caesar patriots dedicated parents spouses coaches people who've been through more than you and I can imagine in many cases and for the rest of their lives are going to have to deal with liberal not jobs saying the most disgusting filthy things to them and their families\nBut they blew an opportunity because now Brett Kavanaugh's in life and number two\nHe's learned a lot from that first life he's probably learned a lot from the last days of those first lives that end on that ah that ended on Saturday that life is now over he's now justice cabinet and he's going to have to deal with the left for the rest of his life\n\nChokes me up a bit sometimes thinking about it is a good man so good man a decent human being the people I Know and I trust you know I worked in the Bush White House I did not know Brett Kavanaugh personally I I make a ... that make no assertions otherwise but I Know people who did\nAnd the people I Know who knew him I trust trust with my my car my kids my house anything they swear by this man swear by this man\nWhat happened to him was an intergalactic embarrassment above highest order it was a cosmic imbalance of grotesque proportions\nBut they blew that and now Brett Kavanaugh is in life and number two\nWhere he understands what he was dealing with and what's been put behind them those doors unfortunately are now largely clothes for him\nBut what's ahead of them is justice freedom liberty\nAnd his seat on the Supreme Court bench to fight for those causes embodied in the constitution\n\nAll right let me take a call here when I usually don't take calls on the first hour but because I always open the phones to uh people on the other side of the aisle to get their opinion and if you want to give us call each other and seven three one three at one one ah please do liberals conservatives whatever I take 'em all let's go to Carl in New Jersey Carl what are you got for us\nHow are you a thank you for taking my call You're welcome and uh I I think it went on and on about Mr cabin off judge Kaplan off I listen to the hearing before all this stuff broke loose and I and many of my liberal friend educated all agreed that he's perfectly fine to be on the court\nOvercrowded extraneous stuff with nonsense and people don't really listen to you know you don't look at how they're going to vote one way or the other you're not supposed to say you know the damn lost something one of the Republicans gained something the country against someone who can be impartial that being said I Want us to get your comment about uh your\nFinancial future in jeopardy if the liberals are in power sure and just for him and I said your screeners was last time that we had a terrible economic downturn and it was under a conservative president not\nWho is the conservative president\nAnd we have we had a big problem in a recession that we have a bank problem\nAnd yeah but who is the ... a weight on but I'm ... I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president you tell me I I don't remember one of those George Bush report\nThat well known parlance that listen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond my trying to be a jerk but I don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service agents\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service they they're not being hyperbolic I mean that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part B I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think insisting he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so\nWe interrupt regular programming to bring you this live University of northern Iowa was sporting event on the home of the Panthers news talk Fifteen forty chaos to the Waterloo Cedar Falls Cedar Rapids\nFrom leader for your own little Panthers sports networks is un I panther volleyball after you buy these general store Casey's\nFamous for Greece a higher fees where there's a helpful smiling every aisle Harvey probably supports the un I ... middle\nMiddle recon energy synergy the money for energy efficiency or a sushi tips for your home or business the lid American energy dot com shields were right there with you fill you in a bookstore\n... she grew fools or all mine you in a bookstore dot com also by\nBoard he ... he used to visit your ... by board now dot com now\nUn I panther volleyball [noise]\nWe got some Monday Night volleyball Kevin you're waiting for the McClatchy center today the un I Panthers hosted the ... and the finale of a three match help stamp first serve coming up at seven ... he with you for tonight's action\nThe third ... says it's four days for both of these teams you and I coming off wins last weekend against Illinois state and Bradley\nAll Evans all swept southern Illinois then lost the five cetera gets Missouri state is is always so tough when you have a quick turnaround like this after coming off back to back matches one\nThere's not a whole lot you can do in terms of scouting you and I pretty much doing a walk through for a practice yesterday just to save some energy for this cat this plus not only does Evans all have to somehow it gets a profit on you and I but as a purple I should have come all the way over from Indiana to be a part of this cancer\nSo this could be a very interesting that you see how much we get out of each of these teams that how much they might be at their best for this one\nGuy you know it is interesting for sure both teams have\nTo be the [noise] you know I I feel fortunate that\nFriday night you know that Panthers inexpensive all that much energy to get the three ... when\nA Saturday Night again there was a little bit different story of course but probably the biggest thing like that on it\nI didn't feel travel so not only did they play [noise] uh you know Friday Saturday like that but ah they jump in the ... and they travel up seven hours over to play at seven and a and they'll get back on that bus home so\nReally what what factor in in their ... and then I mean look at where watching them warm up right now they're ... they're not large in the first place and so\nUh it's not like you make substitutions to give kids arrive store a change things up a little bit I mean he doesn't have that flexibility in this group so we'll see how they perform on of course you want to get mad she wanted to death on health play that's what will happen tonight\nOr brought this up a four on these airways perhaps more on on press row that our game broadcast [noise]\nBut the conference when a few years ago to a shrinking that conference schedule by weeks of the extra we can allow especially the teams like the un I Missouri states before the Wichita states that extra opportunity to maybe get another ... sort of a deep up that resume\nSo you have occasionally these mid week matches this is the\nFinal one for both of these teams\nAnd the Panthers been pretty fortunate over the last several years of that where the travel has it been ridiculously and a lot of times they've been in state [noise]\nBut the big on that evidence all ... like they already had to get their match at rates in a couple of weeks ago and now with this one well might be tough for you and I just have to have another match at least they have the benefit of being at home this entire time before that finally getting back on the road this weekend that kind of feel like we're cheating [laughter] you know just because we don't travel and we haven't had the travel\nFor those uh mid week matches this year our very fortunate and we need to take advantage of it because they're going to be years to combine those mid week\nMatches were going to be on the road and we're going to be out of state a first year or so you know we need to make good use of these opportunities I take advantage of 'em knowing full well that uh our time will come on we're making that seven hour bus ride [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "08"}
