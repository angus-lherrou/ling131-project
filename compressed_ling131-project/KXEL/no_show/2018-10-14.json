call in from the box to the field\nUm players have to communicate and we did a really fantastic job was just talking to each other throughout the whole game on a field office feel\nI'm really getting the message across the stress that we need to make plays for all fans and make plays and even score if we know we possibly could so I'm very proud of the whole defense coming together as a unit stand on the same page I'm playing being a team of Brotherhood I was beautiful\nHow about this new look defense of three three three just three down lineman three linebackers and then then the the other

to another level here in these top ... games as far as your path rushing getting after the quarterback just your overall aggressive enough on it it just it seems like you raised your game here in recent game tricky\nUm that's beautiful thing here I always like things that I almost slow starter I don't know what it is I Try to work out really hard in the summer but are still kind of starts slow I'm\nAdjusting to the game is always different than the teams out of conference plays a little bit tougher because sometimes you never know what you're really going to get and planning the best conference you know you have to bring your best and then\nGet other people at your other teammates to bring their best and that's really what I focus is like\nA I'll Try to stress that to my teammates

pick just because you we made it happen at the line you know we're in a quarterback face oh it's a it's a team thing once I like I said earlier as we keep plan as one unit one body one voice that's

new start drifting ... again those numbers if you want to get in the evening three one nine two three five Fifteen forty eight hundred and five eight four at seven zero to four [noise]\nSo do we talk about the second half the one thing that I remember I was particularly nervous about was that a\nI Believe it was South Dakota second right now is there was a second drive\nThey had in the third it was it took up Ninety four yards in fact they originally started on their six yard line then they got a penalty went back to the three yard line and marched Ninety four hundred yards down the field to tied up\nAt Twenty one and I thought man they're there goes the momentum I mean again\nYou and I had those back to back touchdowns in the second then they start to third trading off bonds and then South Dakota just kinda just march right down the field on them and uh but you and I came right back and didn't and that that's what I was really impressed about what are you and I didn't panic\nThey went on a touchdown drive their own by plays a boom boom boom right down the field um to answer\nAnd I thought that was really impressive because you know when you when you give up a Ninety four hour drive like that on the road that can be very disheartening and um that's one of the things I really appreciate about this you and I think they they are resilient they don't just quit they don't hang their head you know like a ...\nYou know they they they fight back into the fourth day just pretty much on them or it was great again they had those too fast touchdowns after that does have your Williams interception boom twenty five year I passed by from John who just was great tonight on we'll talk more about you in a minute and then uh\nThat ... the I don't think I don't I don't know like how does this act but it was it was a fumble and um was bad it into the end zone recovered for a touchdown\nThat was fine [laughter] that was that was great deal I done tonight again great night twenty four thirty three for touchdowns no picks had to two hundred and fifty seven yards quarterback radio once there'd be a point one and drew to a different receivers really spread it around a lot\nUm and the the running game was fine it really didn't\nIt didn't need to be anything then just consistent tremor I Want to produce a judge why Miller had thirty six yards mean\nNothing spectacular but they did what they needed to do and again the the really the story was that the defense that really is what I'm kept him in the game those three turnovers leading to Twenty one point in the event that five sacks and only giving up whether they be was thirty eight rushing yards that they didn't give up a chunk in the air\nUh three twenty eight I Believe was the final for Austin a semi see at three twenty eight\nSo they they did give up quite a few years but again you know if it you'll hear what you're saying is that you can keep a team one dimension of you can stop the run by the beach and see if they can be with with the bass and they couldn't do it\nSo again hats off to the un I defense um the south Dakota running my Brandon a ball just thirty seven yards you did have a touch them just thirty seven yards\nThat was impressive Austin Simmons overnight thirty four of I'm Sorry thirty four forty seven three twenty two touchdowns one big but he was sacked five times he sprinted onto at ten different receivers he was throwing the ball around too so\nBut yeah hat's off to the un I defense and I just dominant once again so\nVery excited now\nAlright panther fans now

I was little animals that I'd want to have I got married on me because I told him in a on our last dog signed each of those and he does get a\nVisa card and I don't stop again turned into there's all kinds yeah\nWho's your mind off because they can't get on us here at say\nYou're going on now she'll never seen a few times I'm afraid to take titles center and spend a lot at all so am I going to say that\nWe're going to go bowling or what goes on for like getting your snowed in any kind of an accent and there's some I don't want to look again just as\nBad as long as I got off the plane was gonna leave go to bed and try to get out I got married\nOn auto show comes on and on it but as parents or your thought on the same is lower grades don't joke to handle it all started during a time\nLimit on them what do they all want to learn how to buy that that'd be okay scientific as I said daily thing and I went out to be doing at a certain kind of course the winner not a scab each was he was ...\nYears do though I don't seem to bother you\nOr what about on the go to plan to cut you off but I started here started to buy\nBook on who you're not going to let her know good to me as an adult men don't bother my I don't know if he goes I missed part of the minority Randy showing the entire\nProgram I see them and then do you see on state escape and north ice that many young guns bomb revival church\nI think they won't even change the name I think they're going to shut down completely I think another party will take its place and I think the party will be something like the Republican progressive I think the Republican Party is going to split one side the conservative the other side as progressive Republicans the Democrats\nWho are a little bit more in the light and not so radical they'll joining the Republican progressive that conservative Republicans will become the conservative I think that will be a name change but I think the people in the establishment Republican rhinos will form a new party the Democratic party I think will shut down\nWell that's pretty profound because you wrote in your book the Democratic party will never elect another president and the reason is is because the Democratic party is not the party of John F. Kennedy the Democratic party has been co opted by socialist maybe Columbian is get\nThe Democratic party will never run another candidate for president\nThat's pretty profound so you're saying and twenty twenty\nI'm saying they could shut down as early as next year after the devastating losses they have in twenty eight\nTo a new rules are predicted trouble when the electoral college in twenty twenty three hundred and fifty electoral votes and\nGrowing right now that's amazing well\nAnd also the heartland they're off for Trump it's just he's sitting on the coast that are for left wing Democrats\nRight and that's why the Democrats I think are working so hard on getting the border open because they believe a lot of people who can't speak English are uneducated are basically just candidates for welfare and they'll be able to be told the vote for Democrats planets how they'll keep getting elected office at all\nThat's why the Democrats wants the open borders desperate attempt to gain more voters because they know the people here are pretty much was to their idea because illegal immigration is not a civil rights anymore than breaking into somebody's house makes the robber a member of the family\nThat's a good way to put it that way to put it and by the way you see some sanctuary cities around the country are trying to say that they're going to allow illegal immigrants to vote have you seen that\nIn the cities yeah well ... them to get driver's licenses\nAnd they should and they certainly shouldn't be allowed to vote and by the way if you also eliminated all those folks who are voting illegally right now I think you'd find Democrats losing even worse there quite a few\nVoters in there that are not truly legal voters the people who have died some of that has been documented by different researchers I think it's most unfortunate I think we need a voter id law to protect the integrity of all of our election\nI Do too well my concern was there will be a lot of Democrats that will go out just to vote against Trump but then\nWe don't want Republicans become complacent because if we think he's going to win and I mean the house is going to be all Republican in the Senate so we want to encourage people that they still need to go out and vote\nVoter intensity for Republicans a strong going into the twenty Eighteen election because they know what's going on they understand the Democrats want to impeach Trump they don't want Trump impeached so they're failing very strong to vote on the other side the radicals in the last is they're not\nAs strong because they don't see anything for themselves\nThe idea of teaching tromp they don't see any immediate benefit to them I mean their welfare check isn't going to go up if Trump or to be impeached if anything the economy's going to go down and I think they know it they know that he's done a whole lot better than Obama so I think the voter intent saying democratic side is pretty low\nAnd on the Republican side is still pretty high that's why I expect us to be an unusual off year election a lot more Republicans elected then would normally be elected because following a new president uses a party in power in the White House\nLoses a lot of seats but I don't think it's going to happen\nDonald Trump has been the only conservative than decades it actually fought for conservative principles who wasn't above the fray who wasn't intimidated by the media or by the opposition he's a tough fighter who's not docile like past conservatives\nHe's not ruled by the approval polls are pundits when you think about what he did was a serious chemical weapons against their own people\nFifty nine Tomahawk missiles his base instead of a clear message to the world the Trump will use military force also the ISIS strongholds have been really neutralized to North Korea has been diminished didn't even contained\nRight here is a personal axon principles that he believes and he just has an intuition about what's right what's wrong he also does not get intimidated by anybody\nAnd he follows that pattern that the electorate was looking for in twenty sixteen I called the general Patton trend hey man they were looking for somebody tough they didn't want somebody who would be walked all over by the media and boy did they catch that right\nIn the past history United States nine military leaders went on to become president so they were looking for somebody like a general or military leader or somebody who is rock solid like general pat and they found that in Trump Trump is pretty tough yeah doesn't get pushed around by anybody\nNeeds an outsider he's not part in the Washington DC inner circle and he is tough for us and I also believe that God raising him up for such a time is that God gave us a divine reprieve and it's like Cyrus in the Bible and there was so much prayer to\nAbsolutely and this is a country that's based on Christian principles and Christian a lot of the universities and colleges around the country there are gender was in different Christian denominations it's really a shame to see them losing a lot of those principles\nBut I think that the trend is toward regaining the principles they've lost\nAnd that's part of this new conservative era that we've moved into\nWell with the conservatives senators truth has had to U.S Supreme court justices confirmed and he's got two more to go with a couple of the Supreme Court justice gonna retire or die in office\nRight I think that in his first term he will point for constitutional conservatives\nHe may get a fifth and sex and his second term it's going to be a rock solid conservative super majority of the Supreme Court which is going to have a profound impact and a lot of areas of American Life for the better\nThat's encouraging because do you think we could ever get real v Wade reverse\nI think it will be reverse hallelujah because it's not based in constitutional principles there's no right to privacy in the constitution it was a made up right and in fact\nYou think about the ramifications of this so called right to privacy there's no boundaries on it for example you could say a right to privacy means that prostitution is totally legal why not have prostitution everywhere why not have other string\nFor example you could say a right to privacy means that prostitution is totally legal why not have prostitution\nEverywhere why not have other strange things legalized marriage or anything and you just say oh that's the right to privacy well what what is in private that I mean you can think of anything and say it's private\nCould they reverse same sex marriage\nYes what about getting the Bible duck and public schools that\nCould be right to privacy to\nMammoth back in the public school\nWhen you basically make up the constitution as you go you can put anything in there you want and that's kind of what the basis of the radical left is they want to basically have laws what they want not what's good for the country not what's moral now what's happened\nAt all not even what's legal and you don't go along with them while then they throw their temper tantrums and they have their protests and things\nAnd I wait a minute let's remember the Supreme Court has had many conservative jurors that were appointed by Republicans who breathing the rarified here in DC and became a liberal and they couldn't even interpret the Constitution's sort of going along to make up the constitution\n[laughter] I don't believe those were conservative they were stabbed shrimp people us tablets rent conservative you know a lot of people say oh I'm a conservative then you dig a little bit deeper and you find out they're not conservative on this or that or the other thing some of these people\nWere selected because they were sort of establishment conservatives\nBrett Kavanaugh is not an establishment conservative he is a rock solid constitutional conservative I took Trump's original list I went through each one of\nThem and let me tell you there's no wishy washy conservatives are they're going to switch you can count on Neil Gorsuch you can count on Brett Kavanaugh on you can count on the next to the Trump of points are gonna be rock solid constitutional conservatives that will follow the constitution and will follow the rule of law\nYeah what about Roberts the chief justice\nI put him in as a fabulous rent conservative I don't consider him a conservative\nYou went to the whole list as the ones that Trump is going to nominate for Supreme Court justice and they were all rock solid constitutional conservative that's great\nThey believe in the constitution following it they don't make up anything there's a big difference between saying you're conservative and then you just happen to be conservative on certain things and so then you but they think you're conservative John Roberts has proved himself to not be conservative\nThey call themselves conservative ... economically conservative but not socially conservative\nSometimes is that way sometimes it breaks on economic versus social but sometimes they're wishy\nWashy conservatives you know they are here and there it's hard to pin him down exactly where they are but the people from their pecking are better than anybody expected in the last fifty years\nAlready know Jesus said and Matthew twenty four to he said because of the increase in wicked miss the love of most will group cold that you see a return to increase faith in God and maybe even a real revival\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nKPMG TB ... forecast

powerful sunscreens in spending more time indoors and what it really comes down to\nIs this vitamin D deficiency that's out there is causing an avalanche of health problems for Seventy percent of our population ranging from\nPain loss of balance muscle weakness depression increase blood pressure arthritis memory loss and even a compromised immune system and I have Dr Michael ... with me today to

bones ache now there's a lot of people listening who have been diagnosed with al ... which is a thinning of the bowl but again a vitamin D deficiency a\nBig one is ... so weakness do you try to get up from a couch\nYou get in and out of a car and you're finding it more and more difficult and leading to the high high prevalence of people falling and injuring themselves oh okay All right here which is a huge problem right exactly I Know that one is you tend to get more calls especially upper respiratory problems okay problems\nWith blood pressure cardiovascular problems digestive problems caused the patient bloating gas ... it's very very common and if you're a diabetic and all kinds of data about being deficient in vitamin D and the list goes on and on and it's a huge problem\nWhat does vitamin D actually do in the body what does it use for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay and that regulates thousands of genes in the body everything from pain blood sugar immune system blood pressure falling string\nPlus ... has been linked to maintaining call and health brass ... an ovarian health\nBut I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it all messed up\nWell why do you say that why is it messed up\nWell first of all they go to your doctor and they put a vitamin D supplements and it's

they put it in this vast dissolving Mel for immediate absorption and quick results that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr bank is from people that are taking your fast

that\nSure ah thanks for having me again this\nIs a topic that I can get in the way back machine and go back to um I think if I'm remembering correctly too about when I was seven ... and um I was going through some rough times uh in my life\nAnd I started to have\nNightmares ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you can get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream that that happened every time\nAnd when I Would uh when I Would wake up from his dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half a week and half asleep and I would see the shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was that I had a closet that didn't have a door so dark um and\nI had a a Barney Rubble nightly mounted out of the ones don't yeah I had like night light and that was the only light in the room and sometimes it helped and sometimes it cast odd you know shadows minimal but ... what happened is I was going through this period of when he went to sleep I Would have this dream\nAnd I would wake up with this tremendous sense of\nFear and for boating\nAnd I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things away and um I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now and lay me down to sleep\nAnd I knew the Lord's Prayer and so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes and in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers they would make a brick\nAnd I would\nTake these bricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it's like a pillar you know ... and I was inside of this pillar of brick of prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was\nProtecting me if you will from the fears that came in the night and eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear\nAs well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see childish technique because now that I think about it actually it probably wasn't that bad a thing to do but uh that was a time in my life that I had these kind of foreboding fears and and how he

all those the solid Ilene that's about a third of what what other tossup states Republicans would need to take about Seventy one [noise]\nBut um it's going to be close and it's going to be a long night I Would suspect we're going to have a large number of races settled by a relatively small handful of votes\nOf the governorships a lot of those up this year thirty six Republicans are likely to Lucy simply because they have so many and unfortunately there'll be a couple of big state governors in\nChile what do you hear from folks at the ... do they feel politically with a capital a confirmation battle that they have bonded stopped\nThe so called blue wave of democratic advances and to the degree that they still worry about especially losing the house how worried are they about that but if they lose the house had been Speaker Pelosi and Adam ship in terms of intelligence with the impact that is going to have in terms of investigations and hearings and also on their agenda\nI think they feel your first question them on the way if I think they feel like they've been able to blunt back on the Senate side there was this at this point coming out of the summer coming out of Labor Day weren't actually look like some of these Senate right then\nThat should be a pretty comfortable for Republicans weren't getting closer and that seems to have shifted and we now do seem to be in a place where the Senate and definitely leaning more strongly toward Republicans but the question about what happened if Democrats take back the house is really a big cloud over the White House because\nDemocrats will have the power in the house they will be launching that they have already said a whole raft of investigation that not that investigation into things that we know Bob Mueller has been looking at\nTheir open to going after Trump taxes going after a financial dealings of other people and the administration in the cabinet they said something that I think would really basically dominate at twenty Nineteen for the president in part because he hasn't done a particularly good job at laying out what his legislative agenda would be in a divided government\nHe's got the idea that infrastructure criminal justice reform but there's nothing really proactive that he that he doesn't sound like pushing and and the White House because they are under staffed and has been for quite some time they do not have the infrastructure in place right now to deal with a lot of Democrats and I think\nI mean while especially after the capital a confirmation fight there seems to be a push among Democrats to take on Donald Trump on his own terms to be more aggressive and it's coming from some unlikely sources take a look\nAnd you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nYou know when they go low\nAnd like a party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nThem you know when they go low\nLow we ... we should make it clear that later in that same speech Eric Holder made it clear that he's not advocating violence but this move to the lab on issues on tactics do you think it it's good politics for ... well I think\nWithin the Democratic party you see a couple of a political figures are trying to catch up there a couple of weeks behind the music a corporation the Democratic party is in a rage\nAnd they want to seem to be in a rage to they want to be made sure everybody knows they're part of the resistance to\nUh so that's where I think this is I don't think it's good politics I don't think the spectacle Kavanaugh's hearing and the demonstrations that surrounded it\nUm which got pretty ugly in pretty far outside you know bounds or helpful to Democrats at all and you know that this this Kavanaugh business was a very very big deal because it went on so long it was so conspicuous\nBut some members in the middle of it to the New York times came out with a story a very long piece about Trump's pledge cheating on his taxes it through the years\nTo psych without a without a without a sound practically so much so that a few days later the time to read it again and it still seems to have gotten no traction so that's how big a deal at the at at at how much that the capital controls the ground things out and I think\nRepublicans will benefit from this into the midterms whether they can match the Democrats enthusiasm is entirely another matter I doubt that but then there's the Republicans in better shape because of it\nYou can see the Republicans on the president certainly pushing this idea they're dangerous don't give\nA match to an arsonist their logo crazy a do forget the Republican talking points in your view do Republicans do Democrats take the risk of being seen as too extreme the mob could that conceivably hurt them in the ...\nWell I take ... sitting here at Democrat I'm confused because prior to a few weeks ago I was the ... of the party of snowflakes suddenly we're an angry mob with terrorists so but to the point you're asking um it doesn't really matter at this point whether we are as Rachel as build because we've been billed as Rachel\nAnd I would say the notion of when we go high stay high\nThat should have died on November eight twenty sixteen I'm definitely in the Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder camp the anger among the Democratic party is genuine so I think in a very simple way\nIt's good to stay with that genuine emotion whether it is the most effective tactic next month or next two years I don't know but a genuine I don't think it should be ignored\nAnd I don't think it should try to be falsely mitigated\nAnd we're gonna we're gonna see unfortunately people trying to modulate are trying to out Trump Trump\nQuestion how is the Mrs Trump regarded in the Trump White house I mean\nWe know Hillary was regarded we know how other parts like Nancy Reagan how was she regarded as she seen people scared emerging\nAs an important advisor to the president on wherever she seen in terms of weighing in on policy in style\nShe didn't really interesting thing where she is an innocent indices well she is a important advisor to this president but she does it in her own way she is not a first lady who spend a lot of time in the west wing\nShe is not somebody who are like Michelle Obama dead who developed strong relationships with certain people in the west wing it had people there who will serve her voice\nAnd it's a more her to the president at in their private time but she does this effort kind of put her in a box and and to find her and I think what we have seen over these last couple of years is that that's really impossible to do because\nOn the one hand she is at strong supporter of her husband as anyone yet she find moments where she is willing to speak out against him in a really public way some of his policy decisions\nSome of the things that he said on Twitter and I think that that's what we're going to see from her and the next couple of somebody who kind of have to look moment to moment to figure out where she's going to be but but indisputably she is in line with us with this

doing really good thank you\nI don't agree with mark ... hadn't told them fighting off but other than that ...\nWell we appreciate you toughen it through here as we talk talk on the radio or not the best thing to do when you've got ahead go we're going to make it work\nTodd you just got back from a pretty cool trip did you enjoy yourself uh yes I did we had a really good time uh my wife and I spent a little time in Portugal and then over to Spain or what a beautiful place I imagine so you had a little a slight seeing but this is actually a little bit of a work thing to write so you went to get some in continuing education and information at all sure we'll go with\nThe ... [laughter] I was trying to sell it man I was to try and do you just had been basically it was more pleasure the al ... will tell you well let me go to our topic here is that we go to a fund start and talk about a forced retirement which is no fun whatsoever but for people out there they're\nForced into retirement earlier than they planned or at least maybe maybe not force that are being presented\nWith that option there are some common questions that I imagine a lot of these people have and we've got a few of these though maybe you guys can give some tips and some pointers to things to think about a help answer some of these questions so let me ask you know should I accept a retirement by uh\nYou know the so maybe you guys can give some tips and some pointers some things to think about us help answer some of these questions so let me ask you should I accept a retirement buyout offer that the big question and most people do that maybe include severance or just take the chance to stay with the job or what would you say to people who may be in the situation\nWell you know mark that's a great question and that's come up quite a bit in our area as we've had a couple of\nCompanies in town here offer some buyouts early retirements for some of their employees and as it can be a really tough decision I think it's a lot easier if somebody has already been doing some retirement planning and they've got a really good idea where they're at\nAnd if they're at a point in their life where they could retire without any financial issues that decision becomes pretty easy especially in some of the cases where they may be offering a one year's salary as a severance package\nThat makes it a little easier to decide if it's time to retire\nAs kind of interesting we've even had some clients that were at a point where they were going to\nRetire anyway and then all of a sudden a an early retirement package comes up and it's almost like a little gift when they get that bonus of additional severance package but this can be a really difficult time I know my my father went through this when he was a John Deere\nBeing a but we would consider forced an early retirement when he really wasn't ready to do it but in the end it turned out being one of the best things for him a lens gave him some opportunities to do some other things and to start his own business\nWhich ended up being much more enjoyable forum so sometimes it can be a blessing in disguise but I think Tony would agree the most important thing is is don't wait till the last minute to start doing your retirement planning\nOh absolutely the preparation is key and I guess to answer your question marks you to take the buyout or stay with the job I guess the most straightforward answer is well depends on what the buyout is a true Irish or yet how how good or bad it is\nBut you know some considerations if you're in that\nSpot is just as Tom said I don't need to reiterate everything he said you know but but a good plan and preparation is key because you gotta consider things such as health insurance how old are you before baby you breach sixty five or Medicare can help you out with health insurance\nAnd also do you have any kind of emergency fund in place so if you don't take a buyout offer we have seen in the office where they will rescind the buyout offer it's not that it stays out there forever it's kinda I take it or leave it\nAnd if you stick with your job your job may be eliminated in the future it may not you know there's a risk there so if you are going to not take a buyout offer and stay with your job just to make sure you kind of change your mind set in and change your mind sort of say well if my job's eliminated tomorrow am I prepared for that and if you're not\nThen you should develop a little bit better plan for him health insurance emergency fund that type of thing but that's certainly something that you could talk to us about a game we have experienced some people may be experiencing this for their first time you know ever getting a buyout offer or a severance offer\nWe've dealt with it a lot so we've seen all the different uh iterations that can take in or we could probably offers some pretty helpful advice on that\nWe're talking with the guys here on the overtime at reality that is what you're listening to as a talking about just early retirement options and some questions that come up when these things arrive so let me ask you then let's play devil's advocate and say we've gone away from the taking the chances of the job we're going to accept\nThe retirement buy out now the next question is should I accept the pension buyout and receive that lump sum or do we do the pension as that monthly lifetime payout that becomes the next big point\nNo absolutely mark and that's something that you know in our office again we do a lot of marveling what ifs scenarios and that's one of the big ones is do I take a lump sum what does that look like in the future do I take the monthly pay out\nPart of it is also establishing what type of lifestyle you're able to do and to to give you an example some people want to have their bank account fill up each month making spend the entire bank account knowing that next month will fill back up again and they stick pretty good it's kind of a self discipline they're having a monthly payment\nOther people would rather have a lump sum and take some from when they need but they also have to have the discipline\nNot having run out early you know that it may not last year your entire life so\nWhen looking at these options it's best to model out pros and cons and some of it also depends on the size of the lump sum relative to the monthly pay out we've seen some lump sum of equal maybe only two or three years of monthly payments and in that case would be relatively healthy probably makes sense to do those monthly payments\nOther times we've seen it where the lump sum is equal to Fifteen Seventeen years a monthly payments and in that case you may be able to manage the money for a greater return or a greater security of income by taking that lump sum would you agree to\nHide definitely agree I think when you're looking at either scenario there are advantages and there's disadvantages to both options the\nBiggest advantage for the lump sum buyout is as you now have full control of how the money's invested when you can spend the money at will so if you want to spend more than what the monthly check would be that option is yours\nUm if something were to happen to you and your spouse the funds are then going to pass down to your children where if you choose the monthly option and some have said that to you in most pensions that pension dies with you and there's nothing left\nSo if you haven't had a chance to get all the money out of it uh the pension plan keeps it and that's what funds future options you know it's interesting Tony talked about you know how the decision can be a tough decision to make I I've been sitting down with couples talking about the lump sum option or the monthly\nAnd in some cases one may decide that you know I think I'd rather have the lump sum option and then the spouse looked at them and says I see now you invest money and I'm not going [laughter]\n\nSo they want to make sure that money is going to be their jails or sometimes a monthly option\nI mean it does provide that peace of mind knowing that there is going to be a check just like totally talked about every month your bank account fills up with a chunk of money and you get thirty days and then another check comes in some people that peace of mind and that's more important to them\nThan having the flexibility with the money so it's not really that decision and that's why we sit down and will run a plan for you looking at both options what does it look like if you take a lump sum option what does it look like if you take a monthly pension and then we'll clearly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each option\nI Would agree with the Tony I Do think that sometimes age can be a factor though when it comes to hiring someone especially if a company has to put a lot of time and money into training you\nFor position they might be concerned that they're not going to get enough or pay back on the the time they put in a you know if they don't think you're going to stay there very long\nNow we'd like to think that age has nothing to do with them when it comes to hiring and in most cases it probably doesn't but I think there may be some scenarios where it could come into play as you mentioned tell you that's why it's really critical to make sure that you know am I on track and if I Do need to find something or some other type of work\nWhat type of income I going to need based on what I'm going to be able to supplement with some of my other investments are my other assets\nI guess my point would be age may come into a factor even though it really shouldn't and I think with a lot of companies today\nThey look at somebody with the experience like that and to them that may be a very valuable asset to take all the experience you've had over these years bring you into their company and possibly and still some of that on some of the new people\nWork habits a very different with some of the younger people today than maybe what we've had and I know I'm a I'm a little older than Tony [laughter] maybe I'm a little more aware of the the age issue when it comes to um our looked at today\nOut of the more gray hair you get to people tend to look at you a little differently but you know I think everything that we've talked about here is really important and that's one of the reasons that we feel it's important to sit down and have a plan you know if you are presented with a situation where you you might have a buyout offer\nBut it's really good to to have a plan in place to see is that going to fit into what's your overall objective is and I think one of the other hard decisions is should I take it as a lump sum or should they take a monthly\nBy sitting down and planning we can Rania different scenarios and talk about what might be the best situation for you based on your goals objectives and potential life expectancy also is going to come into play here\nAnd then when we talk about do I need to get another job while doesn't need to be a full time job or can it be a part time maybe or at a position where financially you're okay and you can retire and and start doing more volunteer work how you might get a lot more satisfaction out of that\nThe key thing really is is is sitting down and having a discussion and trying to figure out what's best for you\nSo if you'd call us right now we're going to offer you a custom designed for you and easy to understand financial review that will indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial plan\nThere is no obligation or cost for this initial interview\nWe

new retirement reality because it is more than just investment will be [noise]\n\nWhat's it constantly changing financial landscape having a written customized planned for retirement is more important than ever\nHere in Cedar Rapids and the surrounding communities turned to the team at premier advisors for help schedule a complementary review by calling eight four four four to four plan that is a four four four to four seven five to six [noise]\nOnce you start thinking of your finances as a flannel rather than a front on you'll find yourself you know new retirement reality now thanks to the show [noise] came back here with us for the third\nQuarter of new retirement reality it's more than just investments that's our little tagline we use here because it really is it's not just about the stocks that you have in the stock picking and things we talking about a lot of different stuff stuff on here on the show but which\nEgg line we use here because it really is it's not just about the stocks that you have in the stock picking and things we talk about a lot of different stuff stuff on here on the show but we're trying to cover everything you need to think about when it comes to the world of investing\nFinance and retirement especially retirement a lot of our a demographic I guess a lot of our target audience happens to be retirees pre retirees and if you've got those questions and concerns about wanting to know argues that is your plan working well maybe you have one that you've done yourself you a DUI wire or you've got a plan that you really haven't looked at for a while or adjusted\nWell these guys are a great resource to tap into get a second opinion certainly nothing wrong with that\nOr you may find you're doing a great job they'll certainly let you know that and you will part as friends but you may find you need some tweaking in a little help\nSo give him a call get on the counter aid for for for two for plan eight four four\nFour to four plan or they service all along the quarter as I say all the time Cedar Falls Iowa City Waterloo\nCedar Rapids all points in between a lot of time and they might even come out and see you Tony loves to drive as he's mentioned many times on this program if you\nAre not new to the show so give them a jingle and get on the counter eight four four four to four plant and speaking of driving Tony and so when you get out of that car ride around your we've all had experiences at one time or another but we've got all those little warning lights right we all that stuff on the dashboard little show if something's going on\nI used to have this ... back in the day that forever today would have like come on for something it seemed like the one thing and it'd be another\nYou know and so I'm thinking about financial warning lights I was thinking about you really when we were talking about the show notes and that was like well Tony drives a lot let's see if we can do something with cars so that's where we came up with financial warning lights\nVery well I tried to maintain my current none of those lights come on\nI ... I Know we all do but it was a it's an allergy right yeah it was a real with it but just thinking about it right you get different you know leaking oil low tire pressure or whatever so it'd be kinda cool if we had some financial warning life and I'll give you a few things for you guys to to expound on a little bit but\nLet's start with having no idea what it actually costs to fund your lifestyle I don't know if that would equate to like the check engine or not but that's a pretty big one having no clue what it's going to cost you\nOh that's the entire dashboard light [laughter] there you know okay if you don't have a budget I mean most people might have a guess but it's usually way off okay to give an example uh as you're sitting here right now thinking about it I'm On a pose you a question and you need to tell me in five seconds ten seconds\nWhat your monthly expenditures are and you have to be within a hundred dollars\nOh wow yeah I imagine most people will be failing right about now\nTime's up [laughter]\nSo think about that you know most people while you're working they don't have a budget they know roughly I'm putting X. amount away if there's a little extra the end of each month I might put it away or maybe it will take a trip or do something with it\nBut think of all the things that you may not have factored in a lot of the people were factor in All right ballpark ah here's what my mortgage payment is\nBallpark or water gas electric maybe throw in a couple of hundred bucks or if you've got kids maybe a higher amount for food but have you thought about any healthcare costs cell phone Internet property taxes homeowner's insurance\nNewspaper cos I mean all the little things that add up\nYou really need to know what's in your budget for your lifestyle in any type of retirement plan and that's one of the key things we do when we sit down with somebody for the first time as we ask them to go through and come up with a budget it doesn't have to be to the penny 'cause each month is going to vary but you do have to have a good sense of\nWhat you want to do in retirement because most people don't want to lower\nTheir lifestyle they want to keep it relatively close to what they're doing now\nAt least in the first couple of years retirement and if you don't know what you're actually spending you can actually plan for what you're going to spend in the future also having an idea of what your what your lifestyle looks like we do in our analysis we'll look at what all the ... that you have coming in\nWill look at the outflow is that you tell us about when we give you a check list you know when when somebody makes us for the first time we send them a either in the mail or email a checklist of things you should consider put together budgeting items that type of stuff\nAnd what we look at is where is their linkage between the money coming in versus the money you're telling us going out and in some cases we found tens of thousands of dollars of leakage you know each year where somebody says I Can't believe I've got thirty thousand dollars on accounted for in a given year well\nThat's what the numbers you told us are saying and then that causes them to do back in further refined their information so we can put together more solid plan yeah that's what I say lights up the whole day shift yeah it's kind of the core your budget is the core of what makes things weren't while you're working or not working\nYou know if it's in an IRA account and you see that you have a certain percentage of gangs\nOr you can typically cell that investment within the Iraq count re by it or no tax implication in an IRA and it resets your costs basis and part of the psychology of that is to say well if your investment as say forty percent up profit wise\nWell you're more inclined to say well if it starts to come back down again that well now you're up thirty percent now you're up twenty percent now you're up ten percent cut in your break even if it keeps going down and then when it goes negative that's when you might consider selling it\nBut by doing that cost bases reset you're kinda saying oh can put in the forty percent of profits that reset my costs basis backed or whatever the current rate is now you're a little bit more inclined that if things start to taper off or come back down you kinda have that psychological triggered a say maybe I should look into\nChanging my investment or something like that so it's a little bit of a psychological play on yourself but it's a way that some clients that we have\nAre able to better manage their downside risk\nYeah I think one of the other questions that I Would maybe ask areas is when you think you're going to be using the money\nIf you're going to be using it in a relatively short period of time maybe one or two years and you know for sure you're going to need that money I'm not sure you'd want to take the risk of another market cycle where maybe it drops and you see that account that you go down\nSo one of the biggest issues as should I take money off the table if they're going to be using it short term I'd say you might want to consider doing that\nLike Tony said uh you never lose money when you take winnings off the table\nYeah I imagine I a lot of it is a time horizon right that'll just kinda depends\nSome information that Jerry didn't provide but that's okay it's certainly one of those questions that people have on top of mind you know maybe it's a good time to take a little off but I'm sure the guys are probably saying it's always you want to make sure you're outpacing inflation so you always got to kind of keep something in there but a great question we certainly appreciate it\nAnd we've got another one here from Marshall in coral veil\nMarshall says I have a variable annuity and just found out the fees are pretty high I'd like to move the money someplace else but I'd have to pay a penalty to take it out do you think it's worth the penalty to get away from the higher fees while\nMarshall that's a really good question it's unfortunate that you found out that the fees are so high after you've already been in effect yeah\nYeah I Would have been nice if somebody were to disclose that to you up front say could have made a better informed decision about the product that you were going into\nI think the most important thing when you're looking at a fees of an investment\nYou have to relate that also to what type of returns or you're getting out of the product as well and um when you look at the surrender charge to get out I in some cases that may only be two years worth of fees\nAnd then you have to decide gee if I go into something that's a lot less costly can I make those fees up relatively quickly and in the long run how much better off all I'd be\nYeah absolutely anytime you're looking at making a change of specially an annuity that has some fees associate with are penalties you know surrender charges you want to make sure you do a an a and B comparison you know as\nA as what your envy is where you're going are there distinct benefits to going in to be and you also want to look at well what are those fees pain for in that variable annuity there may be income riders you know there may be things in their death benefits\nThat you may or may not be able to replicate or duplicating other investments so without knowing exactly how long you've been in it what type of annuity variable annuity it is what riders are associated with it that's typically why there's extra fees\nThere could be writers that you would never use and you're absolutely right it doesn't make sense to using them there could be writers in there that makes sense so it's not always just cut and dry to say I've got these high fees is worth the penalty it it depends it depends on what your rent and worry where do you plan to go with the money once you do make the change\nWell thank you marshal for the question we certainly appreciate it I definitely suggest calling the team and having a conversation with a more definitely a four four four to four plan aid for for forty four plan\nWhere almost at a time guys uh one more quick one here from Samantha she's in Cedar Rapids and she says uh guys unless something goes terribly wrong we should leave a pretty significant amount of money to our kids\nMy question is I Can't decide if I should tell them about it now or just let it be surprised 'cause I don't think they have a clue as to what our net worth is\nThat's a real tough one Samantha that's a that's a real personal choice that you have to make a I've had this question posed to me several times I've also opposed to some clients that I think would have made sense to involve their children in the state planning that we've been discussing but the main things that are we look at is\nHow will that knowledge impact their attitude towards money and by that I mean if you tell them look we've got this amount of money and you're going to probably have a legacy is you're saving pattern going to disappear you going to spend money thinking that everything else has covered\n'cause worst case scenario is it turns out you don't have that much money to leave that you you know your circumstances change your expenses change\nAnd you find that you want to enjoy that money while you're still around you know those are things that you would want to consider\nAnd that's why you'd want to have a plan or probably there with you while you discuss those investments with your kids kind of to answer any questions they might have and treat it more like a business type meeting you know here's what we have\nExpectation is you'll get some we don't know exactly what is going to be but all of these people are looped in and here's the reason why you need to continue to be a good saver with your money as well just in case it's not available in the future\nYeah I'd agree with Tony I think the most important thing or a comment that Tony made was how old are your children react to the news is it going to have a positive or negative impact on their overall planning and their decisions moving forward and I think that really has a lot to do with whether you should relate that information to them or not and\nJerry marshals Samantha we'll send you a email responses as well we wanted to make sure that we got these questions answered on the air but we will also contact you from your emails that you sent to us in order to uh see if there's a plan that you'd like us to put together for you\nWell we certainly appreciate

return gassed by the way to the business news hour he is a founding fellow of the Sanders Institute Michael welcome back to the business news are nice to see you again nice to see Michael thank you so you're making your way through Iowa one more time from where a well Oakland, California\nIs based on their welcome to fall yeah in the great state of Iowa well that's why I'm here Michael because I didn't hear in winter spring and stuff you might as well right and I was told it was the best season I'm not convinced [laughter] if you got a canoe is really great uh well\nSince you and I have talked back in the winter um there's been lots of changes in economics in business\nBut one of the things that has continued along a trajectory that is scary for most small to mid sized businesses is the continuing\nUpward spiral of the cost of health care what's going on [noise]\nThe reason health care costs continue to increase is because prices are high we pay more for health care that any body else in the world and we have no ability to the present system to control those prices and ultimately the cost of those and\nConstrained prices falls on individuals and businesses in the form of increased premiums\nLet me tell you a story that I heard first hand from a business woman who runs a nonprofit are relatively large one with seven hundred and fifty members\nAnd I was visiting with her about life in general and business and uh yeah I said so what's going on and she says you know I'm really tired as only mean you're tired and she says well I've had to uh take on another job here at or nonprofit because ... you got seven hundred and fifty members you're a nationally known entity\nHow times not be good she well we had we had to lay off our office manager so I'm not now doing that and I said what's oil it's going to actually we're not getting the income from our small to medium size businesses as well is that because they have to pay more because ah for recruitment retention she said no\nThat's part of it but it's health care costs are businesses\nThat are members of this organization are doing Fifteen twenty twenty five percent rate increases every single year for health care it's unsustainable\nThat Michael that is exactly right Michael is that it is extraordinary how these cost increases keep going up for insurance when coverage goes down there are fewer insured people in this country the coverages skin beer and yet it's more expensive\nAnd we and this is the same time we're subsidizing through our tax system the purchase of insurance by employers because we pay three hundred and forty two billion\nDo that I wanted I Want you to this really hone in on this because this is one of the things that we hear\nAll the time if you do away with the current system of health care in the United states is going to bankrupt this\nRight and this is not true the truth is we can't afford not to do improve Medicare for all we can't afford not to do it the reason is simple we will spend more money in the press\nFor not to do improve Medicare for all we can't afford not to do it the reason is simple we will spend more money in the prison system and it will eventually mean bankrupted businesses\nIndividuals who can't get care and of a shrinking pool of covered lives what we have in the system now you don't have to take my word for Michael we had a conservative Institute the Merck hottest Institute\nFunded by the Koch brothers who did a study on Senator Sanders Medicare for all bill they determined\nThat it would cost thirty two trillion but the footnotes said the prison system would cost two trillion more there is not a policy argument against Medicare for all because everyone recognizes it will control costs better\nBut we haven't been told that that's incorrect what you've been told is the governments\nCan't do it or we can't afford it but\nWhen they say that what they're talking about is if we spend it through government we can't afford it and this is this is the mind twist that people have to understand you may pay more in taxes to get universal healthcare but your costs will go down\n[noise] so yes this is this is the mind twist that Americans have trouble understanding business folks understandably so say well that doesn't make any sense it turns out in healthcare does that turns out is more efficient as Medicare proof Medicare spends at least a half\nMaybe a quarter of what private insurance spends on demonstration Medicare sets race for providers that are basically break even as to their cost of providing care there are some discrepancies private insurance doesn't do any of that they just keep escalating premiums and it works for them the drug companies\nGet a little bit more of the hospitals get a little bit more the insurance companies get a little bit more workers and businesses pay more\nBut the system\nDoesn't actually provide care it just as a revenue model for all the industry players the game the financing half of which or sixty percent of which comes from the public so sixty percent of health care spending is public we're not getting our money's worth\nYet because that spending is to subsidies of private insurance not direct provision of care and people don't understand that no why should they they've been told governments the enemy\nOr the problem at least and then it turns out well and healthcare it's actually the solution\nYou know one of the things that we consistently talk about is where the United states is in relative to health care costs and then those outcomes of healthcare and among the industrialized nations\nYou know we spend more per individual on healthcare but our return on that investment is one of the lowest among industrial how does that work\nIs is ironic that we spend more and get less yeah so what we're saying is we could actually spent less and get more [laughter]\nAnd ... and and it's it's right because we spend on average more than twice as much per capita as any other country and yet we have worse health outcomes [noise]\nWe have worse health equity so we have a much less equal healthcare system and as you know what I mean wealthy individuals will spend less than point five percent of their income\nOn health care but but working people are spending ten twelve\nFifteen Percent of their income on health care so we don't get the outcomes we don't have the system that provides care when people need it and that's got to be the principal and here's what all these other countries do that we do guarantee health care with no barriers to care\nThat doesn't mean you don't pay for healthcare it means if you can't you still get care in this country you get all the health care you can afford and if you can't afford it you don't get it\nThat's the difference guarantee health care with no barriers to care well let's talk about\nThat for just a minute you're an expert in this policy area Michael and you've been crisscrossing the United states for a long time talking about Medicare for all single payer insurance universal care whatever you however you want to call it\nThe pushback that I hear from individuals is oh well I my great aunt ... lives in Canada and she had to have a hip replacement\nBut she was put on a waiting list for six months to get that hip replacement and so for that reason this whole thing of socialized medicine if you will is bad\nAnd the funny thing is I you know I've never heard Katie and say we want the U.S health care system there is not a country in the world trade with us [laughter]\nAs I think about these anecdotal stories like it I can come up with an act all story that says a person couldn't get treatment in the U.S had to go to Canada for how many how many Minnesotans or northern Iowans are getting their prescription drugs from Canada yeah I mean let's be real about people's daily experience\nHere you know what are the things that you just said is if we're paying anywhere from ten to Fifteen Percent out of our pocket for healthcare coverage as a working class Americans\nAnd then you add to that the cost of living with regard to housing that sometimes can run anywhere from twenty to forty percent so we're eating up a significant amount of our daily wage\nPaying for a roof and healthcare but that leaves very little to live\nExactly and those numbers also tell us Michael\nWhy health care outcomes are worse\nBecause we don't we can't afford good housing\nWe can't necessarily afford regular care so what you find is the social determinants poverty unemployment inadequate housing poor education these have a huge amount to do maybe the primary reason our outcomes are worse\nAmericans by the age of sixty five have two or more chronic conditions do that is twice the average for comparable economies around the world and why is that\nYou think Michael they don't get health care\nThe other countries guarantee health care with no barriers to care forty two percent of Americans in according to a Kaiser Family foundation study I think it was twenty Seventeen deferred treatment because of cost didn't buy a prescription fill a prescription didn't go to the doctor didn't seek treatment\nSo if forty two percent of Americans are not getting these are insured Americans insured for Americans what about the uninsured and what about the uninsured they have they they basically the we we estimate that the uninsured probably have at least I'm\nAnd I hear a lot for my conservative friends about the importance of freedom and I don't know how you can be free if you don't have health\nAnd I don't know how you can be free if you're constantly having to organize your life around whether you can buy health insurance\nI don't know and so this notion of free how you can develop as a business so I think we're there I think we're at that tipping point to answer your question\nI think when I'm\nYou've seen in the last week the secretary of ha chess attack Medicare for all the director of see a mess which runs Medicare and Medicaid attacking Medicare for all\nPaul Ryan devoted his into session press conference to attacking Medicare for all and President Trump has an editorial in USA Today to attacking Medicare for all are they worried hell yes they're worried and why are they worried but they're saying oh this is going to violate the promise to seniors well here's a question for them\nHow do you sustain a program that covers only the sick is to most expensive patience\nAnd they don't care they're they're going to cut Medicare they're going to continue to privatize Medicare\nAnd they're going to use the Boogie Man and Medicare for all to hide that instead of senior should welcome healthy young people mission welcomed people into a system that will provide revenue and not need a lot of hair and that's what sustains a system that includes older folks\nLived there ... thank you so much for spending time with us again\nThank you Michael what a pleasure [noise]\n\nWhenever it rains it's hard not to think about the folks right here in our community who have new roof over their heads wouldn't it be nice to

here what did you do and how did you eventually meet Leonard\nWell my parents and I lived on the west side and I went to the New York public schools my father was in the diamond business\nAnd down and have found a beautiful yellow diamond actually on my mother found this yellow diamond that I'm wearing on the street in Nineteen forty seven one and I was a little girl and that and those days nobody a value to color downs\nBut at any rate he did well and then they went into retailing\nAnd my mother was very very fine sales person she taught me how to sell like all my life\nBecause every once in a while there would always be someone who was ill and I had to come in and give them the hand after school and and I went to the finest public schools in New York\nA Hunter College high school and then on to college\nAnd I went to the sinus public schools in New York\nA Hunter College high school and then on to college when I was a freshman in college I'm One of my for high school friends was dating a real nice fellow by the name of Bob Bob's best friend was a boy by the name of Leonard laughter\nAnd so Stephanie invited me to a party that her parents were getting and their parents told her that she couldn't have Bob and that could bring lettered if she can get an update the Leonard\nSo the the four of us could hang around while they were having a party for the grown ups with says you know they were thirty\nPeople there reached so um my um my first date with Leonard was a blind date that we arranged by my friend Stephanie\nAnd I'm Larry came and picked me up and my dad's met him and said talk for a couple of minutes and then we went over to Stephanie's house\nThan when I got home my father was sitting in the living rooms which he never did he was usually waiting ups in the bed and so I thought something bad has happened to my mother and then he was going to give me some bad news\nAnd so I said what are you doing in the living room what's happened to mom and she said nothing's nothing's happening said mom\nI just want you know that's a nice boy\nWow what am I should probably you know it was terrible why one getting involved\nAnd it only Eighteen ball why didn't need that pressure\nTo be done usually you know he was being done darling I was so I was such a bad thing would you like to tell you the world up to you\nKnow now just in reverse and when his mother met me she had the same thing to him and he said oh my God and neither one of us were ready for a relationship because he was very young and just about to go into the navy and I were just starting college\nSo it wasn't until I graduated and then he got out of the navy that we started to date\nAnd then I'm I'm about a year later and we were married so we know each other really he was my best friend or I'm Still surprised that I married him and he still surprised that he married every house not really why is that because we were such good friends\nAnd we really liked each other and we enjoy talking about\nA variety of topics we never kept our mouth shut and we were always talking about something and he let me a book I never returned and eventually said well I have to marry you if you don't get me back to the book\nI said okay the conflicts they'll let me ask you what was it like when you first met I said well I\nMet her right in the beginning when I met Leonard and she really was very very nice to me\nAnd she was um she asked me to to help her a hostess I'm with a surprise birthday party she was going to do for him and uh she had it at her home\nAnd she said she afterwards you know she loves the way I dressed for the party that taboo and she liked the way I really did help her\nA as a host and I introduce people to each other I met people for the first time and um you know we got along very very well she was really always good to me\nWhen she how successful ones the motor company to this point and how ... was committing the meter was or what do you not for long and\nWell you know very sensitive about that John in fact nobody had ever heard of Estee Lauder when I met them\nIt was a very small company I Believe they had only started and has a few years earlier had chest\nAnd the launch of the nominal fragrance which\nCan subsequently called youth do which has been a a serious seller for well over ... years which is longer than most fragrances live and um\nYou know she\nUh when I stood behind the counter after I was married um and people would come up to the counter I in the first thing I Would say was have you ever heard of Estee Lauder and they say well I bet she related to sir Harry Lauder\nNow I had never heard of this or Harry Lauder new\nYeah because we both too young to Sarah ... was the I'm a dance hall artist Scottish who is very very famous in the thirties and in the forties apparently in England\nAnd I'm In Scotland and many many people\nKnew him here and he was very popular here\nThings change around yeah there are areas are sure Harry's or relatives related to the U.S for exactly\nNow when I go in to uh uh if I if I'm you know you charge card and people see my name they say are you related to se Lauder so I always say oh I Wish I were I don't want them there and they know the address off that and you want them to put us together\nMore ... more you know going back to the beginning I'm going to read you a quote out of a book on her ... she does is going to be a success story and then what else we won't have to say\nShe said nothing happens so many stories are surrounded the group's big business certainly my big my big business and most of them are miss the midst of all is one the promises magic formula as an institution that doesn't happen that way I cried more than I thought it was called work\nCaution attention to detail last hours of sleep worries ... runs in families do let it go by without discouraged must do you remember her telling you these stories are version or yeah\nYes and the beginning I'm One of the great stories that Leonard likes to tell us how the lawyer and the account and and the friends and family discourage them\nFrom going forward and um so what he says his lawyers make good lawyers accountants make good accountants\nBut if you want to be in business what you do if you stick with it\nAnd you persevere and it will happen\nTo you know that's really great to be just tuning in we're visiting was no longer the senior corporate vice president of the new owner companies and she was a story really the beginning of the larger companies shoes are really very first few
