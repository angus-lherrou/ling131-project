the season and we'll just see how accurate this this\nAnd because you know what what they're doing right now a lot of the bracket now just they're they're saying if the season ended today we've got four valley teams in with Missouri state one of 'em and I'm thinking I don't think Missouri states going to hold up and make it to the playoffs this bracket shows what\nWhat you're projecting it will look like after everybody plays the eleven games that's the way I like to look at it makes it a little easier\nI get both ways but yeah we should definitely see how accurate the mass he ends up being

and cheering on the purple and gold and a huge home football game\nUh yeah hope you'll be there in in full force panther nation as speaking of panther nation let's talk to the leader of the un I paint the athletic department director of athletics David Harris making his usual Tuesday Afternoon appearance on the show welcome back to the program David you're doing good today\nI'm doing great Gary how are you I'm\nGood I'm good I I you know I I Know there's things that happened last week we probably should talk about but I really want to look ahead because this feels like a\nPretty big home weekend on the campus for athletics with the big football game on Saturday Bobby Peterson's volleyball team hosting too on beating NBC teams on friday night and Saturday Night in the cloud center or this is what panther nation lives is is sports weekends like this David\nIt certainly is and it's what people work in the athletics department are here love as well to be able to have a ... caliber of opponents\nAre coming in for volleyball and and football is huge for us we're expecting a bat paint their faces on the amount of support our teams\nAre to be there and and watch a volleyball team continue\nTo get off to a hot starting to Missouri Valley conference or we knocked off a couple of\n... and being team to last weekend and now we rolled into this weekend a with a two more challenges on the schedule in front of those so it's a great opportunity for us\nAs a volleyball program to continue to take steps forward to get better but then just as an overall ah athletics program or to really encourage\nOur stance to come and support the volleyball program that as a playing these games and to provide the type of environment as a true home court advantage for us has been\nA method much or else really needs to be said about the the buys them come in the town for football better than the number one team in the country\nAnd we had the chance to have them on our home field and so it's not very often no matter where you at no matter where you're working on where you go to school or who you support to be able to have the number one team in the country come into your Rena or to play a game that will certainly be maybe for football programs\nAnd so from my standpoint we want to have a place filled we want to have a a true home field advantage\nA when we're playing in that game we know what they bring to the table but we know without young men bring took tables well are we seeing what they've been able to do the past couple of weeks and the games where we've been able to hold our opponents undefeated so\nAre we know we have a work cut out for us this week but it's exciting because you you work in athletics and you certainly live weekends like this where the big games that are being played\nA this was part of the reason that you get into the profession because of competition they cite the atmosphere that can be created or the opportunity to have a really meaningful experience for the Web but who's going to be playing\nAnd then hopefully is saying they'll come in and have a great time and do cheer cheer how or a and help those are the successful throughout the weekend so huge weekend for us and we're looking forward to it\nAnd you're absolutely right David this is what panther players panther coaches absolutely live far from a competition standpoint but then as a fan why would you want to watch it when you can be there so it's a what do you do one day to get fans understand our ticket sales and income people use their football ticket to get into the volleyball game later that night\nSo from our standpoint um the we're really concentrating on marketing and bumper of different ways so we have a number of different ways that you can buy tickets a bit from my standpoint uh whether it's you know\nOn TV I just came from a filming an interview with a recall ... metal be on the news that six o'clock news off Cape WWF all are talking about the game I Believe that will be airing today\nUh it'll be hearing tomorrow will be airing Thursday a we have a couple of a billboard um or electronic billboards here in town that we've gotten some space on piers 'cause we are to be able to advertise a game or you could see things on social media and from the newspaper and on TV\nJust trying to hit all the different ah aspects of being able to get people are\nGetting in front of the right people get in front of people who are maybe haven't heard about games because we know that our fan base can\nRun the gamut as far as age is concerned so there's some people\nWho want to come to these games are but they haven't been in a position to get on social media so they don't know what we're doing all social media arts but they may be someone who reads the paper or they may be someone who's driving around town and we'll see it on a billboard or they may see it in some fashion\nSo we have to be in a situation where we can appeal to customers and the number of different ways to make sure that they make the connection and they understand what's going on because from time to time we will hear people say hey one of the things that would really help me\nA come to this game as if I you know sometimes I don't always know what's going on up running around them dealing with my kids I have a number of things are ... ... if I live uh so I'm not always aware of when there's a big game coming up in the world where I've been out would be more likely to support the team so are we really are trying to\nDo what we can to make sure that everybody's aware of the game where the opponent or the where the significant opportunity for us\nUh I haven't had a chance to look at the numbers that typically don't look at those uh until Wednesday or Thursday of the week to see where we stand a comparison a couple of years ago the last time that we were able to hold them in ...\nUh obviously you're anticipating a significant walk up for the game so uh from my standpoint or we want the place would be full of mental think no matter where the ticket sales are\nUh I'm never going to be satisfied until we have a sellout as adults and so I don't know if we will have at this time around but that's certainly a goal and I believe that if you have the last time that I was on uh from my standpoint\nSo we will have at this time around but that's certainly it's cold and I believe I say if after you've had the last time that I was on uh from my standpoint I'm never going to be set aside and to each and every time a team goals out a matter of who they are playing\nA we're in a position to have a full house our our kids deserve nothing less than that\nWill panther nation let's satisfy da da Silva place up on Saturday at one how 'bout that that'd be awesome David ... to see that to see that don't build the rafters and as loud as it would be that to just\nThis program certainly deserves that we're talking with David Harris director of athletics at\nUniversity of northern Iowa we've only had the one home football game and the weather uh kept some of the the parking restricted at and and you know you're expecting a huge

business and still\nWorking on his classes at you and I write you got to have a good balance don't you know as promised let's talk some North Dakota state\nBy some football with a one of the guys that covers North Dakota state football for the Fargo forum Jeff whole pack on her Billie Jean VIP hotline this guy and not only\nA is a sports writer he does video blog she does sports talks to you Jeff you ... you really you kind of you're kind of in all different phases of\nOf the sports media in that Fargo area aren't ya\nWell Thanks Greg I'm a very it's a pleasure to be on a fewer and the sports ... that's a that's an impressive moniker ... the big things on the horizon for the sports Doug\nAbsolute ... if you met him and shook his hand and say wow that guy's a study that guy is All right [laughter] but ah lifted let's get right into this huge game on everybody's schedule every year when these two teams meet North Dakota state\nOr has been the dominant team not only in the Missouri Valley football conference but an F. C. S. football over the last seven years\nIt looks like it's it's just another year of of great football a lot of North Dakota state you haven't you haven't dropped off a bed have they\nI don't think so not so far on when you think of this game Garry I as a writer UK is there one word that comes to mind and I the one phrase I think every year I just keep going back to it as slobber knock her teams that they just go at it and\nUh you know Chris you can vouch for the ... field um intensity of it all I'm up in the press box is so scary but ah every time every year these teams that have probably goes back to\nOn a two thousand seven or eight when they had that little skirmish in Fargo to him on the sideline and and it's just a hotly contested contests and also you know perhaps maybe the\nAll the I don't know a little friction I think between climate and mark Farley back a few years maybe that has something to do with it too it just offer something that you know it's not like going the Indiana State or this is just different\nYou know the thing is Jeff they just really don't like each other there's a mutual respect for the end of the day between players and coaches but when you get on the field you're right it's a different intensity than any other game I think that you and I place and maybe South Dakota state\nOr North Dakota state similar put a price and but it's it's just something about that and and you talk about the skirmishes stuff like that there's there's some friendly Jain that plagues place down there Jeff that you're probably not aware of but it's a good time\nNow it's pretty it's pretty evident from well by the raptors where we sit at the stuff that's going on I I just uh you know I look at\nAnd I'm sitting on the post game press conference and never James rough yeah he was like six four to eighty or something like that and he gets up and we as a press conference and I think Craig ball is coming in or I saw him shortly after that\nAnd I go wow ... you say James ... yep that's the guy we don't have\nAnd and that was their quest and I taught them how to play physical football and Craig bowl and his staff responded by doing just that they buy bigger more competitive more physical powerful guy and\nUm to me that was that right there if I could pinpoint one press conference or one day we're NDSU said gee we'd better either you know do something different here or we're gonna always be looking up at you and I and that was that day James rough and James Robin tied NDSU how to play football\nThe James rough in effect that's interesting and and just to piggyback on that is an interesting story to share with you two years ago when we lose at your place in the play offs and lose for the second time that season at NDSU on our post game show with coach Farley he said we have\nTo get bigger up front in our lines are often see blind we need to find guys six six six seven sick we hadn't been to an end it was comparing it to what he had just face\nAgainst North Dakota state and if you look at the size of the one I live in the back ups the young guys that's what they've gone out and done so it's it's interesting how these two teams\nHave looked at each other and said hey we need that if we're going to get to where we want to do so that's an interesting story though that you can go back to that ... that James rough on impregnable and and look at the players now that North Dakota sneak puts on the field\nOr ... how how did how did I Know that game last week was huge it was the big tone around Fargo when your football team and your university and the whole area and what a game that turned out to be that that's great that's yes football I was able to follow a all of that on Saturday um\nHow now as you turn the page does North Dakota state football not just the players and coaches even their fan base how do they how do they look at this one this Saturday coming to Cedar Falls going down the road for the first time this year\nYeah it's a I guess the way the fame we're from within a team I I get the sense it's just\nIt's another week you know they they don't treat last week it's the Dakota marker it's\nSTDs you but you get the sense that a ... yeah it's it's for the marker but I really don't think the players I mean they have fun parading around for ten minutes but I think that's it [laughter] you know they they they had it in the locker room but after that I'm sure they went out to dinner that night and\nI I don't think they really gave a whole\nYou know it was at the end all be all just because they got that's called a marker and that's all you have to treat the season because everybody's pretty good look at Missouri state God's sassy how they used to be the doorman now they've been to rank teams and [noise] so you're on well okay the when and yes you are you and I when they play each other it's\nIt's not the old days deco fifty five zero and that you're going to see it's probably going to be pretty good it's just it's it's every week and I I I don't know how you get up every week I don't I don't know if you can but uh\nI just think there's a certain games that I have that built in level of uh and it was the ... and this was one of them and if you get I think you can do it back to back their young kids now Chris you could probably vouch I don't know if you can do it three foreigner open I think you can go back to back on something like that\nYeah it's tough it's tough to get up for every single game in the you you don't have to ... or the Missouri Valley football conference when you've got a game like South Dakota state than NDSU\nOr he yeah sorry south posting than you and I and then you go to McKown Illinois it was so annoying that's probably why the vice and they'll play well down there Jeff it's so hard to get up for a game and McConnell Illinois when the places kind of a dump it's a long walk from the locker room to the field there's not a lot of people there it's just they really is\nYeah it is and you talk to players all the time that that they they thrive on really cool\nHard nose environment so I'm sure you go when you walk into that yeah you and I don't want your NDSU I won't take much when everybody's on top yeah and yeah you got the garage door opening of all that stuff it it it gets to play and there is no different players coming to the Fargo them you know the other teams they love getting up for it I\nI've seen a few um\nEvery team that's beaten NDSU for the most part has had their little celebration in the Fargo dome and they've you know and the left corner there they're all celebrating like you know it was a huge win because it was not many people do it [noise] that's so teams get up for any a few teams to get up and you are in Iowa and when these two teams\nPlay each other I don't care you know where you're at it it's it's gonna be a it's a it's a big game and it's a fun game\nAnd guys isn't it also when you were talking about you know for ten minutes they celebrated the Dakota marker carried it around and then and then they're onto the next ... it is kind of crazy and and maybe it's not just in football all the sports how the the thrill of that big win\nWith a marker carried it around and then and then they're onto the next deal it is kind of crazy and and maybe it's not just in football all the sports how the the thrill of that big win is so fleeting it's it's it's instant then it's gone and then you're onto the next deal but I gotta believe South Dakota state\nEven into Monday and Tuesday may be still hurting then revealing a little bit from the last ... it's crazy how we carry that last longer than we we really get a chance to maybe enjoy that fleeting moment of both of those big victories like what you guys had on Saturday\nI I think you're right I think you're right I I Would bet so they everybody has a twenty four hour rule or almost everybody already get twenty four hours to celebrate a winner last\nI Would bet it's probably thirty six to get over a loss and tell them twenty minutes to celebrate and when I was right I mean yeah you're probably right on that it's a ... or maybe that's the way we're wired today's society that are already you win a game okay let's go on an excellent\nUh let's wrap it up with this uh I'd I'd like to just get your thoughts as you've seen North Dakota state are not only this year but in previous years and those great\nNational championship runs a when you look at this particular matchup on Saturday with with this North Dakota state team coming into the unique don't what what are their keys to win one of the things that they got to continue to do that it's got um after this undefeated starts so far this year to to keep it going and get a road went on Saturday\nWell one I think you've got to put pressure on on the line Don I think I'll probably be quest number one if you get done out of his comfort zone like any quarterback\nMakes it a little tougher I I wouldn't I I I I just think you and I when when they were so dangerous than the ... they had the tire out running effect where you know they had that quarterback who could really do some damage with his legs\nI I think they need to maybe go to more of a wild cat they got to find a way to make that position more dangerous with Iran to rather than just throwing the ball buys that are pretty good defensively and I mean they are they really are they're they've been around a long time and got a lot of veterans guys\nProbably not going to fall much I'm so afraid to ask you if they continue that sort of defense of president I'm just curious to see what you're an eye on what the answer is with with their office whether\nYou know they do something funky a you know mark ... been known to do that even any throwing three for Adam one near the ask Amy for the year ... or you know so it's not like he's never done anything like that before it was just curious to see what the strategy is and and and see what it is early on with ... with both teams actually\nWe're we're going to put three quarterbacks on the field one's a pattern quarterback ones of run and pass guy and another one is is a cruel triple threat who are just where he's going to use so you won't know who's going to get the I'd know I don't know I'm just I'm just have perfect yeah they've got to do something different\nI think you do I after last year's game I I think you have to I I and okay what's the answer what we're talking about how the programs answered each other NDSU answered you and I know you and I answered NDSU with bigger Lyman okay what's the answer to be from the last year or two you know what you are not as answer of pure steel that is\nGreat stuff as always before we let you go is there anything else that that you want to share with us concerning NDSU football before we see you on Saturday in the in our beautiful unique don't\nOwe pretty healthy team uh so uh you know there's nothing um no I don't think surprise lineup changes on ... I'm just a\nYou know I met ... I'll tell you that yeah yeah you know we all do still um yeah I ... what is it two years or something I I still makes me sad every time these teams meet and he's not around but um you know uh you know light moves on and I'm sure he is going to watch the game for somewhere\n... hey real quick to ah how's Lance done we know a local kid here a heck of a talent or ... you know him and Bruce Anderson that Campbell of of running backs tremendous Anderson seemed to get a few more carries how's Lance\nStudent well he uh had that hip surgery last year and then came back for the title game he missed what oh seven eight games last year came back he he wasn't maybe full strength but I did play in the national title game\nA that subject actually came up today and we talked to him and he said and he's not going to admit if he wasn't but what I'm hearing these fall goatee he looks the party looks\nIt looks like old Lance I'm sure he's got a lot of family I Know he does know lotta ticket demands for an M messing ham and all the all gang are coming back so uh yeah he he looks good\nGood stuff always great catching up with you will see a Saturday a prior to kick off in the dome thanks jab at\nFord gentleman yeah enjoyed it talk to you later\nI think it's a bit of a misnomer to say that you like you can't run I I I think he lie when he needs to\nHe can he can avoid sex he can get outside and he can take off but he I think he'd much rather sled and throw and B that pocket quarterback but they give him no credit at all for his mobility and enabled to uh\nTo move I I'd like to see like maybe show on this Saturday that you know what if I have to\nI'll I'll run for a first down or to eat it just that weren't really\nThat many chances this year that he really needed to do that\nNow you know you look at is is that yes there correct to net\nRushing yard is negative Fifteen not great but he has three four yards rushing of lost ... lost forty thirty four you're on the ground because he's been stacked a couple of times that is right you know things like that that's a staff it's a little misleading per quarter back you know what I'd love to see sports guys when you're like on\nThe NDSU forty our time and it is perched Downey run for for yards and then it second down and you run for three act and this is about you just you run in the ball you know Dan dent in the ... and then all of a sudden John bon pulled up and they could do like ... and\nHe lied done has like a thirty are game on a run to make me I Would smile so big and the stand and just be great you know since ... going to be up there and a\nIs are they going to allow this maybe this guy can do something but you got to get creative if you wanna get he lied done to run\nAnd you'd be thinking hey those guys that said that he couldn't run it all that this guy I mean he's he's not like he certainly is not like tearing Christian I Will give you that are in eastern sticks a great running quarterback too he's a he's a huge problem because he can really take off but I\nI think there are times when he light when needed can do that um [noise]\nWe'll see but I thought that was interesting the way they broke down and sometimes it doesn't hurt to hear what other people are saying about your particular personnel to in a way kind of self scout self see see what they see in your team that\nYou might you might as well because there's a couple of times and you know you lie Randall read option a it was wanted Indiana State I think at the end of the second half it was read option Reid option going down and the goal line there was one time he really should uphold that are pulled and I it really looked like he got comfortable hand the ball to Marcus but he's\nGoing to have to call it a couple of times to make them respectable\nHe's saving it for the the ... he's saving it for the the ... yes and we'll come back after news and what\nIf you're looking for a great place to enjoy
