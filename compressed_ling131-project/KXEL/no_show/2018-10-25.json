published by all points books subtitled the thrills chills screams and occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidency I loved the prologue here what I should have learned in your lead up with this quote\nMajor fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you know that you're actually\nRight yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo uh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as a full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that our audience can feel\nAnd touching relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced and been around the track as I certainly have and you can\nAnd do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability so that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence issue just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd say to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I'd only taking the time to look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic but super high level of psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you\nAnd I asked myself some basic that's super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you\nI Would have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to the very first sentence and one example of it major fantastic what is that about\nWell it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago [noise]\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters covering his press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen at any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here you're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic\nThat's true I should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what is that those two words actually made and the sense as I say in the book\nOf adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\nAt your table exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct arrest us and and I say to myself they're all sorts of these great clues\nThat Donald Trump was essentially laying before me\nAnd if I had taken more time been more\nCurious about this different kind of political actor and there's different ways of dealing with language I learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of practice lock\nWell with all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets yelled at let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared now does I mean let let's let's just do you look at the at the the circumstances of this man\nI I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that he is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we learn can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric uh sponsored\nRadio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses\nHe had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was a completely different actor and different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game\nAnd I write it early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do check black\nOr that Trump ought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who want to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these ... parents say don't you know the rules why don't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lions and you know that sort of thing and it took me awhile to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what\nThe lines are different he's drawing them and look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nThat we're going to have to pause on that note I Want to come back we're they look at how some other Republicans learned these lessons with major Garrett in a moment\nFrom a cedar valley record or this is the voice of eastern Iowa news on fifty ... the one who's falls cedar\nRapids I used

from the Iran nuclear deal\nAnd create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to Iran\nAnd so much of U.S

through this community college right oh drove through what the science Rob front on them you know the that you you could tell me okay this is early voting began with a political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they didn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse fried or where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little farther couple of more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand\nThose and I was going to go there and I said nah\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot walk from pouring rain\nBut when I uh got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the banks is ... outside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how you doing everybody's laugh and

rains have backed into today 'cause it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right up and there were three or four machines that were open in when in in and voted and it was done now the interesting thing is I was wondering since I'm a college campus policy young people voting\n... ...\nBecause ... number one I never felt that was my real number two I never thought the people that were listening to what I had to say had to be encouraged about well this is the great\nThing about especially our audience I I think the the the people that listen to our show and and and especially I think beyond or just\nNew listeners the ones that have been with us for a while I Believe there you know we're all\nKind of standing in the in that same line you you were were part of that that same mentality and again they're they're leaving themselves I Know they don't need me to say and they know they don't need me to say it and that's the great thing there is that a bad that understanding and and the only thing I\nAnd I think I mean we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know war needed for is the fact that there are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their jobs they got their families\nAnd our job any of them were eating right now right in and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day and what's going on in the issues in a different form that they can get from anything else and I would say that's about it now\nAnd I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do\nWell that's you know makes me feel useful [laughter] yeah

right or whatever it is the new beginning we're not calling now so [laughter]\nUh but as far as an end so housing has gone up you know we look at there's an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred there it's pretty big issue a and the rate of construction every time we kept it it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you and I are totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slow is a labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment developer or in North Dallas for video road log here is

the heavy rains into the deep south by tomorrow Easter by sixty five and I Ninety five into the Carolinas\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open\nBorders bingo we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said ... pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and earlier this week as well they have to be positioned to very clearly the question has to be asked\nWhere do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want he\nSaid again I have argued elsewhere the parties should have been braced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just to understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was ... two thousand five ... just if they they made the decision just a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years of Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWell with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because of Republican shouldn't be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\n\nYou made the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you wouldn't want done issue them the challenge and that's what ... was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't and they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nEither get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we and brought it to your attention the demographics that want the least legal immigration\nInto this country are blacks and Hispanics isn't when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go to the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even Trump has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThey do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you know the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that therefore open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll pull ... we're going to poll aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own\nPeople ... yep but you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something pass\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here\nRight do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't do after they're part of the party that endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silence is your consent\nYes silences your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's Vernor Vinge a isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the boats most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that wants the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time and now you have the you know abolish ice\nProtest they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who\nAnd I mean the from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi\nOr they promoting that may be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want\nBecause that's the official what political battle\nHow can we have and how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for

and I'm Mary McNamara morning well\n[noise] uh latest [noise]\nHere on the events from yesterday the FBI said last evening than it had identified seven suspicious packages addressed\nTo prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and the parents and for the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nThis investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package\nThat has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central mail facility was evacuated after employees found a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported\nWas addressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to waters that were similar to the five and a reference and its earlier statement the LA police department tweeted that its bomb squad had rendered the package\nAt the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we are have a right now a again a the one thing that is\nA bit I've I think uh everybody\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected\nPotentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the Democrats\nAre you know we're picking were well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't have any very few\nVery faint when you're ... we know these devices were said we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities have told us already the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television yesterday\nSaying well it looks like see what you got here and what you got here okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um you can tell the like the label\nOn the packaging that went to see Annette well we know it had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things\nBut in terms of\nThe the bomb experts that were on well here's what it looks like still doesn't tell us the facts what it appears to be and what it might be for what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me the most though is again the people the cry that the you know there are the\nUm\nAre the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness\nThe the you know there are the um\nThere are the

October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the misery scout that has Holly up by one in that\nThey are dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat\nWas a tie a than the Missouri scout but has Holly up by one in that and build a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that uh the claim is he gets wine and works out during work hours which we found really interesting per cent of race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation ad yeah they'd be gorgeous why not that he\nDrinks or you want to have purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours\nYou're probably a salaried workers were just as your your state salaried employee yes yeah uh but but I I'm thinking that that that's it but so do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after\nYou can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people or the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be\n... and I said it until I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west but something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days\nWhen we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice here's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry of the particular we had a streak right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nUm you know what I Know now that you've never heard of honor of yeah right now you know you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah which you know I Will see if if that point works out or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[noise] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approve this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks they used to the mainstream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy\nThat's what that's what they're trying to that's\nHow they're trying to do the positioning here that board is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in it no so pro tired of writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extremist you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nWas the term they felt the term crazy Democrat ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that added\nUp right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the un and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they're looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric is what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah I think what they're\nThinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that ... they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats my not part of the crazy Democrats but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term\nWord right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate or that are Democrats that can be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have\nA couple of times it's because of their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races and\nOther states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have so\nThat the effect is that come out one Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going on or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point a Kamala Harris or you know as side with as you're crazy Democrats she ... as she just did as ... outside [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action right we've talked about it before the vote up and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats then that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be on whether and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she condones that\nBehavioral Lenny we saw during the cop Kevin I'm ... and and that's my ... I'm Wondering what three effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy but talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back ... that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with\nThat vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning\nTheir behavior you I'm not you know all of that that's the that's the evidence to back up their opinion yeah they're coming to that conclusion his cabinet just proved that the eight six six Ninety right I\nWas really muscular and recorded radio oh\nEvery Tuesday and

[noise]\n\nActually\nAll news now to always have today's Iowa politics report in thirty second\nUp to reality but the team and a mere advisors learn like your retirement is more than just meant tune into the new retirement reality Sundays one whole news talk Fifteen forty ... ... email is scheduled your visit with the premier\nAdvisors team called a four four four to four plan that aid for work for two four seven five to six in the meantime listening to the show Sunday not one whole talk Fifteen forty ... the\nThe new retirement reality more than just ...\nIn the meantime listening to the show Sunday not one home Fifteen forty ... the new retirement reality more than just investments\nIt's all their fault line Jeff's done with today's Iowa politics report\nThe story continues to develop even today a series of a half dozen or so packages somewhat powders somewhat bombs address to Democrats and said to arrive at their homes or places of employment including CNN in New York\nThis after a series of physical and verbal public altercations involving Republican politicians and a growing sense that the anger by each side against the other is going to get someone killed literally\nThose on the left yesterday blamed Donald Trump for fostering this anger and defended their own actions by saying the only people getting physical right now are those on the right\nOr if it is a the house is going to have to give an eye on their work requirements for food stamps no it happens that I think that that's good policy but we can't get sixty votes in the United States Senate so unless the Senate unless the house of representatives backs off on that require much\nAnd I don't see any compromise between the two so I think they have to back off\nI I Wish I could find a compromise\nBut uh then that means that we probably won't get a farm bill if they do back off a good chance of getting a farm bill between now and Chris or if we don't get a farm bill between now and Christmas I imagine we'll do what we've done a several other times when farm bills have run out we extended the existing farm bill\nWhich is a five year farm bill starting in twenty fourteen extended for one year into the fray in Nineteen crop here\nThere's a level of pragmatism that is necessary in legislating that I'm not sure people who are really gung ho for their own side and talking about citizens voters as opposed to lawmakers and that's your people are as a nation where his understanding of that because in order to get anything done\nYou can't just draw that line in the sand on every issue because of both sides do that nothing happens\nYeah that's true and particularly a ... I can imagine because I used to serve in the U.S house representatives pray irritating to four hundred and thirty five people\nWhen you use the argument we can't get sixty votes to get something done in the United States Senate and so then they argue your door you the six point rule but it's been the tradition of the center for two hundred and Thirty years at\nA minority view is ought to be protected and if you have a just a majority decided everything a than a minority and never has any important in the United States Senate is the only place in our political system where minorities have a point of view and new moderate extreme views\nAnd there was a reason why we have the by camera legislature if you're just going to go with a fifty point one percent you don't need two houses\nThat's right and of course uh uh it was one of the major compromises of the uh uh ... constitutional convention or where a lot of people from bigger states want to just a house representatives or if you had two houses have majority rule\nBut you never get a constitution so they came up with what is known as a Connecticut plan the Connecticut plan then said we're going to have\nA ... a a representation by population or so the bigger states get more representation house representatives but each day was going to be equally represented in the United States Senate\nAnd they nailed it down so strong\nThat it's the only part of the constitution where it says it ... no state shall be deprived\nOf its representation in the United States Senate a equal representation and US Senate on without their information so it's one of the it's the only part of the constitution that can ever be amended\nAs we're talking about how the framers set up the government I'm reminded when you were in the Iowa legislature\nThe judicial appointment and retention plans were changed adopting the Missouri Plan you were part of that when we changed how we retain judges as opposed to popular election yeah that is something that\nUh we've had some listeners who wanted us to talk on our programs about the judicial retention elections\nThat was a good call back then and now don't you think\nAh yes and I think you find that for instance where the impeachment of\nActions that was a good call back then and now don't you think\nUh yes and I think you find that for instance where the impeachment of\nJudges in West Virginia now\nI think they've impeached or the entire Supreme Court right because uh of a a friday done an activity or not being resourceful the taxpayers' money\nAnd a lot of that comes from the fact that they were elected people and uh there was even a Supreme Court case that dealt with whether or not or you could uh a heavy elections and have equal rights under the law\nI think the Supreme Court ruled you could have partisan a elections but that doesn't mean it's the best way to do it and so ah for a\nHundred and fifty years uh Iowa did it the way you said uh we used to have partisan elections\nOr in a sense they were kind of non partisan because you have you had a a separate judicial nominating commission for people to be on the courts are particularly this rain court\nAh but they were selling elected by the people in most often you had only Republicans elected back in those days who are not the bipartisan a state that we are now\nAnd so it was my first year in the state legislature they came up with the Missouri Plan\nA and obviously had been adopted in Missouri before then\nAnd so I had an opportunity in the Nineteen fifty nine legislature and then like after do under our constitutional amendment process you have to pass it\nIn two successive legislatures so in Nineteen fifty nine in Nineteen sixty one I voted yes went to the people and in December of ah Nineteen sixty two it became a part of the constitution\nAnd it comes up because all judges stand for retention yeah every however many years now heading on on their terms and that's coming up soon in and I wanted to talk about that because in your role as the chair of the Judiciary Committee a month ago when we talk by phone for the program we\nTalked a bit about the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings now that there's a little more distance what you think is going to be the lasting impact of that whole month long episode as we go for it whether your the chair of the committee or someone else is going forward\nI think that it it will not set or pattern for futures a\nSo this is not now the new normal as they say\nI sure hope not now and you know we've only had two or three weeks since then but five days after he was approved by the United States Senate we had our first meeting of the Judiciary Committee and I expected a lot of her rain by Democrats about what a previously and gone on for a month\nThere wasn't a peep except one or two sentences out of one senator about it\nWe had a they just dropped it moved on and as it has Hansen I'll show you how we are within an hour\nOf that meeting we had cleared another eight or nine judges who are committed to go to the floor and a couple of pieces of legislation and we didn't have much trouble doing it there was some ah some difference of opinion whether or not judges should be voted on our committee or but there didn't seem to be anything left over from\nHaving all that seems to me to be one of the untold stories about the the first two years of the Trump Administration the number of judges that have been moved through your committee and those are lifetime appointments at the federal bench\nYeah there's been more than eighty four judges moves through my committee\nBut eight eighty four judges have been approved by the United states and more judges in the first two years of a presidency than any president in the history of the United states there by another thirty out there\nOn the on the counter waiting to be proven ties and we're probably voter another a dozen or so out of our Khamenei during November and December yet\nWhy so many is it just the the course of vacancies in retirements or why so many at this point\nI think a lot of older people who are judges that were appointed by Republican presidents would like to have a Republican president appoint their successor\nSo I think you have some more resignations I Can't give you a statistics on that but that's my position and then uh there wasn't as many approved and the last two years of the Obama administration is normally would be approved so uh uh we started out this year with a hundred and forty seven vacancies\nAnd you have retirements every week and maybe retirements every day or so that's kind of like a shooting in a moving target a week is there will be approving the most judges and the history of the country and the first two years of a presidency and still\nHave a historically high number of vacancies\nWhat sort of work do you think can actually get done and what they call the lame duck session that or or the first to the air because if there's no change in the balance of power\nThings may not happen but if there is a change in control of one or both chambers obviously those who are still there are going to have some incentive to try to do some things yeah telegraph which you think and they happen\nIf she takes over the house of representatives\nAnd she becomes speaker and that's why I'm campaigns are hard for people like young bull bomb so to make sure that proceed doesn't\nUh and Democrats don't control the house because it'd be basically a put a stop to the the the programs that are this president needs to get past\nSo I Would suggest to you\nThat we hopefully get a farm bill\nAnd other morning the weather balloon launch from the quad cities weather service office showed\nThousands upon thousands of feet of bone dry air and so they radar returns are clear up there\nAt over ten thousand feet so that's where it's raining his way up there and down near the ground where we are we don't have much to worry about that it's most common in the winter months but we can have this happen in the fall and you can probably feel the drier today a little bit more than maybe you have the last couple of days\nYou really get people who say your radar is broken\nOh yeah I'm not surprised I just yeah I saw the on off all either it's either it's either\nBroken or they'll say something's wrong with your radar something's wrong with your website something's wrong with your app something's wrong with you\nUm do it out and I just had a lot happens but I mean that's that's one of the big big hang ups\nIf you are are running a radar um like we are we try and keep things as filtered as we can\nUm occasionally though will be in a situation where even the filter if you run the filter it's still going to detect some stuff that you'd rather not have out there so I'm a wind up happening as you'll see a little more light blue than you normally would in the wintertime and that's that's generally the science behind that just takes some time for the atmosphere to saturated and once it hits the ground than\nAny shades of blue or green after that usually wind up hitting the ground successfully\nGive us a sense if you would have the next thirty six hours into fail yeah not much rain or we can't go with the bone dry forecasts as much as we'd really want to right now because again this looks so low impact to us that uh I really don't want you to worry about it that's a very slight coming in here tonight with just a handful of isolated rain showers that may occur\nAnd it's not like they're focused along the front of any kind either um so that doesn't really help matters is who may wind up getting them if you do happen to get an isolated shower a couple of hundred seven inch tops that's enough to wet a sidewalk or street and that's about the extent of it for tonight\nTomorrow anything that's left over from tonight is the only justification for having rain and tomorrow\nSo we're not going to see much redevelopment of any kind for tomorrow we'll keep it going to the early morning basically and then the rest of the day is similar to today partly to mostly cloudy and almost identical temperatures of loaded mid fifties playoff football I Would not foresee any concerns my weather standpoint\nNorthwest than extreme north central Iowa could pick up an isolated shower in that part of the state rest of the area should be fine for the playoff football games low forties on the way and let's say you do get a little bit of rain of football in North central Iowa\nIt's extremely extremely light in isolated you'll play right through it not a problem a chance for a handful of rain showers again as they go into early Saturday morning\nOtherwise the main event here for two reasons is probably coming in Saturday nights Sunday will squeeze out whatever moisture we can from a strong cold front\nAnd number two you probably noticed it on the forecast we put out it's going to get windy again you have to go into Sunday and some of those winds make us over forty miles an hour at times so relatively calm restive today tomorrow Saturday then the wind really you'll start to ramp up on years ago this Sunday\nI thanks for the insight symbol talk to you in the morning and we'll talk to Justin in an hour or have a great rest of your afternoon All right you didn't

Rapids\nUs ... on his way into the studio we will talk with him at length coming up in this hour\nEarlier today Iowa governor Kim Reynolds began a full day of campaigning\nIn the Cape Iowa moving effort the acronym of course is Kim she's got a red and white Winnebago RV that she's using to travel this date it was parked in Cedar falls this morning and before she started the rally we spoke in the RV outside the Hilton garden in just before eight o'clock\nSo here we are very close to the election one will be different if you're the governor over the next four years as opposed to one of your opponents\nWell the first thing that that they had read my name as hair I raise taxes on an island and I certainly don't want to do that I Want to continue that poverty momentum that we may not be the last couple of days\nOr wherever getting taxes for hardworking I went down ... heads on fire marriage that were ... ... jobs ... like never before all that back in ...\nAnd small businesses and farmers that we're investing an education and job training like never before and we have a budget that balance to hundred and twenty seven million dollar surplus rainy day fund it fall and we're looking forward to continuing that six that's and that's making sure that we have an integrated coordinated healthcare system for everyone\nThat we continue to grow our economy and provide opportunities for Iowans and continue to invest in our greatest asset which is our children\nAre a lot of attacks these days that just comes with the territory correct the record on the ones that you think are the most egregious mistakes that are being made by the others in talking about you and your plans or your record\nWhile it just drives me crazy when they say we're cutting education because there can be anything further from the truth I'm a mother and grandmother and I'm a mom of a public school teacher and I know that there is nothing more important than investing in our young people and we have record investments work force in the country eighth and teacher salaries but nationally recognized them program\nAnd we've increased sending every year not cut and so that just disingenuous and it's not that show and I think that just really makes me mad because he's not being honest with Iowa and then the other thing when you don't have any ideas you just resort to scare tactics and that's what we're seeing now\nUm you know I was I burst that's nothing but a scare tactic I worked um Nineteen years and the county treasures office I'm counting on that pension so or my colleagues that I worked with for Nineteen years\nUh my daughter is by year's end to education she's counting on it and so I went I went to know that they have my pledge that I'm going to work hard to protect diapers and the way that we do that is to make sure that we have a strong and physical state budget\nAnd that we have a growing economy so that's what we're seeing and that's the best way that I can assure Iowans that will happen solvent and a strong pension program to honor their promises that have been made\nYour band tour RV tour a is keep Iowa moving very nice acronym and this is an Iowa made already is\nNow it's a what a bag out so you better believe it or is it a lot of fun I like we've sat we made five stopped yesterday so we\nYou know that was the first day we had just really great and do the abdomen momentum and turnout at each one of the rallies were doing it with a statewide we want to show Iowans the team that we have in place and how important it is to elect Republicans up and down the ticket with had Senator Grassley with it that a couple of stops\nAnd it's been really fun to have him along and out there working on behalf of\nOf Republicans vow and then I think with seven stops today and we're going to be all over the state so we're going to just keep Iowa moving and we're going to keep moving while we're doing it\nI've noticed that your democratic opponent and I was talking about moving Iowa the right way which suggests that it is moving and moving forward but that he has a different plan so everybody wants to keep on we're moving and again the best way to do that in the next twelve to twenty four months is how\nWell to continue to look for opportunities to reduce taxes to invest first of all I'm so happy that he's finally found sort of a positive thing to say about Iowa at everything that he talks about his doom and gloom and there's nothing great happening in the state\nAnd I'm Sorry but the facts are undeniable when you have third parties alligators recognizing where the number one state in the country second lowest for unemployment there that managed we're paying taxes go down\nWe're seeing incomes grow up a three straight quarters of income growth that's great for Iowans as I said the budget balanced hundred and twenty seven million dollar surplus and were investing like never before an education job training and health care so\nIt's just you know if you listen to what he's saying and we heard this\nIn the debates his answer to everything was more money more money more money and then bigger government bigger government bigger government and I just that's not the philosophy that I Believe in I Believe that this is Iowans money and that we can't always look for ways to make government more efficient and effective and that's what we're doing every day\nWhile still providing the essential services that Iowans are counting on so I don't believe that raising your taxes in the right way to go he's doubled down Don double down on that and\nIn his own words I didn't say it and you know he said he wouldn't he wouldn't have signed the bill for affordable health care and and I think that you know that impacts Iowans says well\nI Know you have people waiting for you down the street so let me ask finally you're familiar with the single speed ruined company in the old wonder bread building in Waterloo I don't know if you were aware of the fact that the black hawk county Republicans wanted to hold their election night party there and they were refused because of their political views what are your thoughts because you had events there\nYeah and I think it's unfortunate and\nYou know I think that uh you know they should serve everybody and that's who we are as Iowans in I Would think that their business with a you know want to be open and welcoming to everyone and I think you know actually I think that she took advantage of some tax credits that they\nAre the state made available and they don't have those out based on what your philosophy is it based on criteria and so I just think it's unfortunate and\nThat's what's wrong with politics today and that's one of the reasons I was really proud last year of our legislative session with the number of bills and really significant ones that we were able to get passed with bipartisan support three of them you know and honestly every single legislator Democrats and Republicans voted for mental health reform\nUm pitcher already Iowa has got a job training down and then continued suicide prevention so it can be done and I think that's a practice that we should try to incorporate in everything\nSafe travels on the ... thank you looking forward to it\nI Will governor Kim Reynolds speaking with me from ... in the hotel parking lot in Cedar falls early this morning she made her way to CBD at technology park way for a rally at eight o'clock we spoke with her before they got started\nJoining us now in the studio live is the first district congressman run Bloomberg View Republican making his way through the district today that afternoon Congress should\nGood afternoon always good to be with you Jeff in oh it's good to be on kids feel\nWe've got about three minutes before our bottom of the our business break and then we'll speak at greater laced with the congressman afterwards which ... the\nPeople who may want to know no control of my life you have to schedule body breaks but you know what's interesting is uh obviously the last few weeks of a campaign or the voters are engaged\nIn so uh you know the girls are bigger there's no media attention and uh uh I get a lot of energy from a from the crowd so it's even though they're long days we put a lot of miles and it's very energizing thing it really is\nJust as soon as they get an old use the governor's schedule as an example just because I was aware that she overnight it in Cedar falls but that was only after a late night last night so she's on the road has to deal with somebody like me but for the first really which is at the stroke of eight o'clock I think there were seven schedules through the day\nWe just don't appreciate how much time all this takes in the infrastructure that you need in order to have a trembling road show even if it's a a congressman viewing district visits when it's not even a campaign season\nMount of coordination unbelievable and uh and truthfully I cannot tell you where we're going next after this interview you don't do it when we get back in the van they'll say okay here's where we're going next year's what you're doing and he doesn't want to know\nBoeing next after this interview [laughter] you know when we get back in the band they'll say okay here's where we're going next and here's what you're doing and if he doesn't want to know so I just focus on this interview and when I get in the van I'll know where I'm going next up here and now as it really is\nA Senator Grassley a wasn't Marshall town earlier this week that of course is part of the sprawling first district twenty counties are talking about the tornado recovery in the sixty seconds we have before the break give me a sense from your conversations with city officials\nAbout the federal reaction and what can still be done to help\n[noise] yes uh uh the the governor applied for a FEMA a disaster relief\nIn the ... there's two portions of that and now I'm going into great detail Jeff but there's the public portion and then the the private ... the public portion mean money is available to read refurbish or repair public buildings was approved\nOn any of our bills almost any of our bills and I believe the reason is politics that they feel to be rewarded\nFor doing that you know to say Republicans can't govern Republicans can't get anything done are in the ... most of the major bills have resisted is every step of the way now they're rewarded\nOr in a twelve days for that type of a\nA resistance movement well then I I think we are not in a good place than as a country because then the Republicans will probably turn around and say well work for them let's just have us resist and then two years will be will be voting back into power and with the voters and he just said no we want you to work together and we're not going to put you in office because you resisted\nEvery single I mean there wasn't a Democrat vote on the tax cutting jobs ... not a single Democrat vote and you know we've we've had many major bills that have not had a single Democrat vote we passed over a thousand bills Jeff in the house by simple majority\nAre but in the Senate ah here's another abuse thing is the filibuster rule or take sixty votes to break a filibuster and move on to voting on a bill they filibuster every single bill the Democrats do every single bill it's been abused or been abused big time in the Senate\nNow this is just my I Hope impartial opinion is I work at it I think the voters already have been sending the signal that you were suggesting that we want you folks to work together which is why you have if you look at the past decade you have a Democrat elected president but in the mid term elections after Obamacare is passed\nThe Democrats lose control with the chamber and yes Obama won reelection but that was closed and twenty twelve while the Democrats took a hit and twenty four team when you were elected then you get a nontraditional politicians elected in twenty sixty I get a sense that the voters are already saying\nKnock it off you not go head to let's get together on things but the really entrenched wings of each party and I'll Wayne each card equally aren't quite getting that\nI agree and I asked this question almost everywhere I go and I don't I don't pretend to be a political psychologist nor do I pretend to say here's what happens at the speaker Ryan Nancy Pelosi level\nAt out here's what I typically saying it's the truth at my level\nYou know a sophomore so for example in Congress we get along great Democrats and Republicans and I've had a Elijah Cummings who is who is an absolute icon on the Democrat side co sponsor my bill for whistle blowers for example and the clean slate act\nOr just the way I had to close sponsor a Lisa blunt Rochester Democrat from Delaware we get along well at our level as you go up it seems to get more and more partisan on each power structure\nIn one thing I did this is the gas is their billions of dollars that's what the B billions\nOn the Democratic side in billions on the Republican side and you know ... ... in it and it tends to pull apart and the the the the two the two parties in ... I think to make each party maybe a little bit more extreme\nAnd I I Wish I really wish we could get money out of politics and have it be a debate about ideas come election time but there's also this thing called the first amendment\nAnd uh you know people have a right to freedom of speech and the Supreme Court has said or giving ten dollars to a candidate is protected under the freedom of speech\nBut there's there's too much money in politics we've got to get the money out of it and uh [noise] you know on the big issues of the day when we go back if I'm lucky enough to be sent back to Congress a health care reform we got addressed that immigration reform has to be addressed welfare\nReform has to be addressed all three of those things we better bills if they're bipartisan because I often tell\nHas to be addressed welfare reform has to be addressed all three of those things will be better bills if they're bipartisan because I often tell my colleagues in Washington DC you know Republicans don't have a corner on great ideas and neither do the Democrats but we've got some good ideas and so today\nSo let's take some of their ideas and some of our eye ideas and pass pass a bill to move the ball down the field and move America forward\nYou almost need a mediator to get between the two sides and just come up with something on those three issues that you just identified as being key or central give us give listeners a a thumbnail of where you stand on those and where you believe based on the interactions where you believe your opponent may stand on those issues\nAnd and do that in sixty seconds right [laughter] that was the ... there there is no clock in the rooms there are those three as you think the second one I didn't go [laughter] but it held healthcare reform ah I I Believe we have the finest quality of health care in the world and that's why kings and sheiks\nAnd a very powerful people come where when they really get in trouble with their health they come to the United states of America so we need to keep here's what we need to do keep our quality of health care where it's at high right but we need to reduce the costs\nThe problem is that costs have gotten so expensive that the average family can barely afford it some can afford it\nSo here's what we do we keep helping people the government helps people help senior citizens who paid into Medicare helps of veterans helps the engine who are poor and special needs folks right we help them financially with their premiums or this or healthcare services\nAnd then on the other side of the equation the supply side we've got to get we've got to cut down these government regulations and health care why can I buy insurance across state lines I live one mile from Illinois one mile from Wisconsin\nWhy can't I go on line and have fifty healthcare plans to pick from a hundred\nBecause right now you know we're limited to what one or two why can't we re import drugs from other countries you know you go to Canada and Mexico and ah antibiotics or nickel on the dollar what they cost here though these are just so many why can't I buy health insurance through an association\nYou know if I Belong to the national restaurant association I Belong to the n._r._a. or I Belong to the ah Teachers Association why should they be able to offer health insurance policy they in effect can now but let's let the miracle of the free market drive prices down through increased competition when he's more competition when he transparency of pricing\nWhat other industry Jeff too you know where the seller that'd be the physician okay doesn't know the price of the product and the buyer that'd be the patient they don't know the price of the product neither one does right right and you know other industry do I know that\nYou've got some faceless nameless entity yeah that is controlling the situation for each correct\nCorrect so so I Know I'm trying to simplify 'cause I don't have much time but that that that's the way I see this working on my opponent a heavy Finkenauer wants to basically have Medicare for all which sounds wonderful free health care for everyone right\nNow and it's going to cost conservatively thirty two trillion after the tea or dollars over ten years we would have to pay for that we would have to double everybody's\nTaxes that they currently pay and that that that wouldn't even cover it because we Jeff one of the services free it's over ...\nSo the price would probably be forty or fifty trillion dollars on immigration reform what a mess and then we're seeing this a caravan coming from Honduras they'd been coached\nThey've been coached to say that they fear for their lives and their native country and uh then then we have to have an asylum hearing and what happens is uh they're assigned a court date and typically a year 'cause we're backlog to two years away and they never show up but they're in our country\nAre so so we have a mishmash if that's a word of rules regulations and laws of governing immigration them piecemeal together over Thirty years we need comprehensive immigration reform and ah this this caravan from Honduras\nThe way there's another caravan has been former Guatemala and that's coming in right behind them if we don't stop this uh this is going to be a steady stream of folks in their game and the system I've talked to ice agents are gaming the system and they've been trained on what to say\nIf they step all you know one one foot onto American soil so we need we need we need to secure the border and the timing is not coincidental ... I don't believe so now for a second right before the election so many to secure the border\nFirst of all and then uh we we didn't we need him at\nImmigration reform comprehensive uh I'm for I'm for legal immigration thousand percent we need more workers in Iowa we have more jobs than we have people looking for jobs and the unemployment rate is so low in Iowa a manufacturers and most companies say I can't find workers so I can expand it's going to hold me back\nSo we in legal immigration is one place we can get more workers so I'm for that but we need to have it be legal and we choose who comes into our country we don't have somebody else choosing comes into our country my opponent\nA is weak on immigration is weak I'm On a border security and if she's anything like Nancy Pelosi I think she would probably vote lock step with Nancy Pelosi August ... fundraising for\nMy opponents top three fundraising cities or Hollywood\nNew York city and Boston top three fundraising cities and my\nDaughter does last I checked were in the first congressional district\nNo and and you know I always say a tongue and cheek I didn't know the folks in Hollywood cared so much about eastern Iowa\nThey don't they just went by a congressional seat my top three fundraising cities F why are they view Cedar Rapids in Waterloo as I think it should be within within the district or and then the third one was welfare reform once again another source for workers\nFor workers or with a farm bill for food stamps looper the work requirement in there in the house version of it\nOr the Senate took it out in the version and we're in conference now but here's what it said Jeff if you're between Nineteen years old and fifty nine years old five nine years old you're injured physically and mentally able to work and if you don't have a child and under the age of six in your household so you don't have a toddler in your household we said you got to be working\nAnd should be working at least twenty hours a week or going to one of our amazing community colleges in eastern Iowa and getting a job skill and that's what we have in there and I think that's reasonable most Americans regardless of your political stripes agree with that\nUh we have a hundred thousand of those people in the state of Iowa that fit that requirement there is a hundred thousand workers\n... your guaranteed to an expert in fact we went with all insurance companies and make all the repairs continuing to consider I face straight and how they match refinishing when it's time to get your vehicle looking great again to Capitol no this is\n\n\nWell that was a busy day wasn't that you heard from Senator Grassley congressman bloom and governor Reynolds all three in the last two hours will have more with Senator Grassley tomorrow and talking in detail about these death threats that he's got they'll have a little bit about that in the news coming up after the top of the hour on breast rollers rhyme annex it\nFor voice of eastern Iowa\nTalk forty KFC Waterloo cedar\nNationwide man ... ... it's a local state and federal investigators try and narrow the surge in the ... can suspicious packages and to high profile Democrats factors going off scot more lives\nDo eat the N.

at eight hundred five eight four\nWell I think they're the where this Texas jak office is different than what we've seen in the past is they're committed to the wrong game and they're good at it you know I think in the past they want him to run just enough to keep the honest\nRight now they're running 'cause they want to run and then they found a really good freshmen running back taste on Henry a guy that I Wish they recruited a but he's really been good and\nHe's aloof and they've got an office of line with five starters returning all five guys back from a year ago it's best to offensive line they've had in years slip a much more of a balance even though they're still third of the nation in passing yards and they they can lay up through the air\nThere was a top five in the big twelve and rushing yards and and they're doing it very effectively so they've got a good balance and that's the the really hard part about scheming against them\nI I still think if you're talking about John Hancock and his bread and butter and what does he do well\nIt's always going to be about stopping the run first so I think that will be our states focus is to slow down the Texas Tech Ron game force Allen Bowman their freshman quarterback this maybe make some throws under pressure Bowman has been really really good and uh\nThis is I don't know you're going to find a better\nMatch up anywhere in college football this season or maybe ... any if she's going to the last four or five years that fits toothbrush many\nTrue freshmen quarterbacks against each other that are as good as they used to a ... been playing great football brought party's been really good so this was a rare unique opportunity to see so true freshmen or do battle and I\nI think both defensive staffs are going to be trying to put pressure on that other quarterback and trying to force those young quarterbacks makes mistakes\nJohn Walters the play by play voice of the Iowa State psych lone radio network on her village in VIP hotline to kick off this Thursday edition of old PR from the old pi you John ... as you prepare for the broadcast of this one on Saturday and eleven AM kick and Jack ... stadium\nIn ain't what else have you have you learned maybe information about this Texas Tech team you can share with us anything else on the the psych loan side of it what else have you discovered as you prepare to cover that one Saturday\nI think probably a lot like give me a lot of what I Do is I watch videotape of the team you're going to be playing as much as I possibly can uh videotapes antiquated word I watch my DVR\nHuh of games and I watched several ... and I think the thing that really jumps off the page to me is the length of their receivers you know\nLast year I when when you look at the off season and people kind of we're analyzing what's gonna happen and what's ... football I don't think many people thought they were going to be such good I'm part of that is all types of ways they lost all their skill position guys so they had the five starting on friends of mine than returning\nBut almost all the wrong offensive skilled position starters\nHad lobster graduated or whatever and so you know quarterback running backs\nThe vast majority of the receivers including Kiki future you had a great year a year ago but the receivers in the past where those smaller quicker guys that could really a kind of turn the short play into a fake play they still have that capability but they have tall lanky receivers right now uh\nTo shave Ashford about six six a that was the best ones Antwon was late six by these got almost like an hour was are type a bill to him but he's the\nLeading receiver and the big twelve so they're going to present some real problems on the outside for Iowa State they've got a quarterback who throws Niagara Falls\nAnd you know it's it's going to be attached for this cycle on defense I think one thing that will be interesting is kind of Iowa State when a shooter out if it turns into that I don't expect it to be that way but\nAs we saw with the Oklahoma State game sometimes games get off and so you know and James or you know good rhythm off ... can I Wish they'd go toe to toe with a really high scoring Texas Tech team I think they can the way they've been playing off ants lately but I I\nI think they'd prefer to you know have a a more of a slug fest on that but you got to be able to adapt and roll with whatever the game presents so I'll be really curious to see just kind of how this game starts out as it is it one we're both defenses are having a hard time stopping the opposing often says or is there more of a a little bit of a given sake\nHonestly John I'd love to see another West Virginia type game for the cycle and so you never know Bronx pretty when you talk about that yeah it has to be a lot of\n... ... when you talk about ... pretty Johnny he's been rolling recently and then comes by week I had the thought that the by we could help ... continue to improve the true freshman give them a little bit of time to take a breath what are your thoughts on the five weeks ... pretty\nYeah I'd ask Matt Campbell about that today and he said you know that's the thing that he doesn't really worry about what brought you said he's the same guy every single day so a ... he's not concerned the Bronx going to have you know the success and he's had to go to his hat or anything like that [noise] um ... is a guy\nYou know that has only had really a handful of practices as the starting quarterback you know and and so now he's in that role and so that's why we probably did help him quite a bit in that regard just to have a bunch more practices and as\nYou know number one role um so I I I think you can only help them but you're right I mean the thing about ... now now he's got this little bit of experience she's got a couple of games worth of experience under his belt I think that can really help him it's also going to help opposing defenseless you know what his strengths and weaknesses are\nBut I think it's going to help ... quite a bit too to understand those things as well and fine tune some of the things that might be as weaknesses although I haven't seen money so far um but\nHe's just a student of the game loves the game and a competitor and um I I\nI think the week will help them a lot because it got a lot of number one snaps which I hadn't been the case very often before that\nJohn before we wrap it up talking I was ... football or one or a couple of the key to get this big homecoming when\nKeep this winning streak going the schedule really turned in the favor now the psych loans for the last six at home are still got that shot hanging out there you could get to the big twelve championship game lot to play for so cycling fans want to know what ... what do you think are a couple of the keys\nThat are that are important for the for Iowa State because of who your opponent is and what they bring to the table to knock off this Texas Tech ball club\nAnd I I think one big thing here is the Texas Tech is a a pretty good second half team they um they haven't always gotten off to a great starts but they've really performed blown the second half of games off as planned defensively [noise]\nSo if I were state does manage to get out to a leading this game especially given what's happened the last couple of years I don't think you can let your guard down I don't think you can relax or or Texas Tech is very very capable of putting together a big comeback show I think that's really important and then I think that the simplicity of it all\nProtects the sec is very very capable of putting together a big comeback show I think that's really important and then I think that the simplicity of it all run the football and stop the run when you can do those two things against ... attack\nYou put yourself in a great position to win or really any weight but it's I think especially against them because when you can run the football and chew some clock you're keeping their office off the field frustrating them a little bit and then when you can stop the Ron you're making them one dimensional team I mentioned that they're much more to to much Nolan they've been in the past\nYou love to get them back kind of being one dimensional this week where they're really trying to rely on the passing game\nAnd then when that happens I think what happens a lot of times as you get into the ball here or there or maybe the the down wind men get a hand up and the flux went up in the air and maybe you get a pet can turn that into points and that's where you can really pull away and a game like this so uh I\nI think those are the big things run the ball stop the run and that'd be ready to play sixty minutes don't don't roll wax do lead your guard down at all\nAlso a real quick a big twelve media basketball day was yesterday anything uh anything big from the cycling camp come out of that\nAre not anything big newsworthy wise I did go down to Kansas City um you know you did a coach pro mentioned the camera wired\nA ... there's going to be some discipline for can at the start of the season they didn't get specific about how many games he's going to be out but this all\nStems back to you know the the the things in the off season with camera and him are really trying to\nGet his wife and order a that was something that costs promise but really proud of the way the cameras handled the situation\nFeels really good about it but there's still some disciplinary action that comes with um you know

Solomon young is out with an injury that coach from said you know could keep him out\nUntil sometime in December and that's a big blow it you know a a growing injury for so for solo um you know you're very thankful for him and I always say perspective right now the Michael Jacobson from Nebraska transferred into the Iowa State program originally from walking\nUh he'll be playing a bigger role than anybody could have imagined early in the season before you get those two guys back and then\nYou know George ... the true freshmen might have to step up and play some post but it's but I think what you'll see with Iowa State as coach problems going to play small you're probably prefers that anyway\nAnd he has the ability to do that with the why look bath and window waking up in jail in order to talk er Mariel shale rock show I think you'll see him go with a smaller line up\nVillage in my kid the rain every Monday and Tuesday it'll lead picky eater and picket vendor pill available at participating restaurants [noise]\nNews I'm Kathleen Maloney the FBI is examining tens suspicious packages center mostly well known Democrats this week we've been targets former vice president Joe Biden in Delaware and Dr Robert De Niro in New York City\nWe continue to advise the American public to remain vigilant as it does remain possible further packages had been or could be mailed these devices should be considered dangerous FBI\nAssistant director William Sweeney the devices are similar and described by law enforcement as crude it's unconfirmed whether they could actually explode social media doing its part to encourage people to vote in the mid term elections\nNow revealing to the New York times several after two weeks that has helped over four hundred and Eighteen thousand users registered to vote on each video sharing app chat Fox is Christian Goodman says the majority are young between Eighteen and twenty four\nThis is Fox News [noise]\n\n... benign first solar forecast for the rest of your Thursday Afternoon these clouds hold tough look for a high this afternoon right around fifty four degrees isolated showers possible overnight down to low around forty isolated showers possible early tomorrow a high right around fifty three part that are mostly cloudy otherwise look for another chance for rain late Saturday in early Sunday\nI'm even I'd be ... to ... news talk Fifteen forty ... out\nThe eastern Iowa Deborah jury is fifty two degrees from ... welcome back to ... press row\nGod news talk ... K actually ah\nWhoa whoa\nNews talk Fifteen forty K actually uh [noise]\nI'll go back to what they should have on press room with the sports guy I'm Gary rhyme of the show live from the other place\nOn university avenue in Cedar falls here until seven o'clock tonight whole PR up until six and then six to seven\nHits panther sports talk with mark Farley we spend an hour with the un I head football coach talking you and I football let's talk some western Illinois Leatherneck football because\nThat's the one I panther opponent this Saturday in ... Illinois to give us some insight on this Leatherneck football teams Scott corn burg joins us live on her village in the I. P. hotlines he is the play by play voice ... football Scott welcome to the show how are ya\nI'm Greg guys thank you so much for having me on\nGreat to give John uh after you probably had another busy summer of calling a minor league baseball now it's football time and it looks like this Leatherneck football team I I Know the records three and four\nUh and and two and two in the league but you guys are putting up some good numbers this year this looks like another quality Leatherneck football team that all you have to remind panther fans up is that you came into the unique dome last year in beat us thirty eight to twenty nine\nNo doubt and then Gary I'm sure you're you're a super excited for a for Saturday's game as well I'm really looking forward to it because if it's anything like\nAny of the recent games that western Illinois and new and I played where are all in for a train and I think the three and four record is like you said is definitely a little bit misleading another tough non conference schedule for uh the leather next but\nYou know this is a team that's then I think getting stronger even though they've lost their last three games to the three losses are a north North Dakota state in the Illinois state so um that's difficult competition but they really played\nVery well against Missouri's they down in Springfield last week and\nI'm by far was their most complete game most consistent game of the season and that had been a little bit of an issue even in their wings before that but there's a lot of town on this team and are still some good senior leadership that's kind of a helping out these young guys grow at this point mid to late at a point of the season\n... and in your lead by a senior quarterback and Sean Maguire this league I think is loaded with great quarterbacks and you've got a great one\nDirecting your office in the senior from Franklin Wisconsin he's thrown Seventeen touchdown passes two hundred and sixty five yards through the air per game you've got the great senior running back and Steve Mix Shane [noise]\nUh not only a leading you in in rushing but leading you in reception I got to believe a lot of the office was going to go through those two guys on Saturday isn't it\nOh no doubt about that and and they're starting to try to mix in a ... a he'd had a little bit of a quieter starts of the year but\nBecause they don't really have a number one wide receiver and use a lot of their running backs and the passing game and make sure there's a huge part of that or Clinton rack of age number twenty five also a big part of that\nBut everything that western Illinois accomplishes a it's a team that has so much star power that the senior class and and and all kinds of those two guys and I'm Sean Maguire is just taking another leap forward it it's really amazing to watch him play\nQuarterback because they don't have a very good offensive line at least compared to what they had last year that the players are they're talented but they're young and very inconsistent\nRunning game really hasn't been there at all safer last week and they don't really have a number one wide receiver because guys keep getting hurt or or there's just a lot of inconsistency a deposition and so\nWhat Sean is doing the numbers you mentioned Gary ... it's just simply amazing because they've had to change the ... last year\nBecause they had a ... senior off into line that can hold\nTheir ground quite a bit even in the past ... it was a really complex up and\nPlay action deep drops it sure they can't afford to do that and are shown it's been an amazing job with adjusting and Steve make shame that I mean he's\nYou know you and I think they're going to go into that with with the on I'm sure because he's\nAnother extremely talented player from the same family Steve is amazing and gave him and he said all he needs and some of the the players who've seen the man they're receiving game they're running game and the return game this year a truly a phenomenal player to watching his speed\nOn pretty much every single time he's on the field is the ... ... is the best of any other players so those two guys that off and uh they need them to have big games they did last week or coming up a lackluster performance I think for both them a couple of weeks a book or go against North Dakota state him on deep into the seniors\nAre ... from the particular and Clinton moon is a huge ears to really reinforces a pretty strong unit\nScott when you talk about Sean Maguire he's been solved that he was solid and do you know don't really solid actually in the unit don't last year the one not taught him build this year it seems that you throw ten interceptions any any reason why he's throwing these interceptions as they've just been a couple of bad passes or something that Leatherneck fans are worried about at all\nI don't think people are worried about it it's a great question and I think um for sure on\nSome of it is a Hindu foreign one game against the north Dakota state and the other part of it is he is probably forcing a little bit more throws if western Illinois down um that happened a lot against Illinois state and he drew a one late there that was particularly bad but\nI I think because\nSometimes you don't have a jail in acklin land for no or or a jelly bores the Leno or heck even a damn they said like he had done is enjoying a right now sometimes it is difficult for guys to get open and\nIf it ... a little bit more I think he recognizes what what you guys are both saying is that you know they need Sean Maguire to be\nPhenomenal to win and I think sometimes that added pressure you know maybe he tried to do something you shouldn't I I still think he's had an amazing year the interception numbers are are definitely higher than I think he's bike but um I think sometimes it's been forcing throws where he's just trying to make a play trying to do too much\nAnd sometimes there has been a you know a little bit of a ... a communication issue with what a lot of younger a new wide receivers they've especially earlier in the year we're trying to break in at that point\nScott corn bird the play by play voice of the western Illinois a leather next radio network on her village in VIP hotline on this Thursday edition of OPM boy when you talk about a young often see blind\nYou're not kidding Scott you start three red shirt freshmen a red shirt saw more into senior some youth right up front in the old line\nYeah absolutely and are they to their credit they played a lot better than\nOur as the season is going on and and that was a big issue\nYeah absolutely and are they to their credit they played a lot better than\nOur as the season is going on and and that was a big issue in the beginning of the year and then the running numbers bear that out I mean they're they're barely averaging a hundred yards per game on the ground and that\nAre far below where they were in the past it's one hundred second in the nation so um you know that kind of bears that were the office of line is just like the passing game they banned that these\nAnd they've gotten better and better as the years going on and so that's the hope when you've got to a young group they I think they knew they were going to struggle a little bit that's why they kind of adjusted scheme a little bit to have a quick are passing game and the fact that they couldn't really have a\nUm a league wide receiver they can get up and down the field and to their credit you know when you've got\nYoung players a lot of the time especially on the offensive line the more they play the more they think they're lumped that time they get better and I think that's really true with this group I mean they just had a off into alignment of the week in Austin hot\nThere are there are glimmers and they're going to be tested obviously on Saturday just like they are every single week in this league but I Do think that\nThey will use violence and intimidation now what will the radical left then that'd be thinking that would do if they control the government\nAmerica's back is responsible for the content of this

selection committee understand when it comes time for a March Madness that a selection Sunday\nOn that looks like a lot of the the ... teams are going to get some opportunities in the non conference part of their schedule the chalk up some some big wins that maybe maybe the team didn't get as many\nA top flight opponents on their schedule that they would have liked but there's going to be some opportunities out there for the Missouri Valley conference to to make some noise to make some waves in the non conference season\nWell there certainly is and ah you know the big was going to be the

I guess what\nYou're in the playoffs here six two in the valley you're going you're going to the playoffs and you\nYou know you have a chance to say thanks so yeah it's a it's a game you know they they got to be feeling you know we\nWere weren't good spot here we get it when you know and you and I say it's the same way but you know this is this the big one\nAnd and ... when you do look at you and I coming off the win over a number to South Dakota state last week they come home a week from this Saturday the Panthers do and they host Illinois state whose ranked either ninth or eleventh in the country would ever pull you like\nIn a way it is that proverbial trap game that everybody talks about that\nThat can be a let down and I know coach Farley do everything you can to make sure there is no let down but you do sit in that spot that it makes it a tough game\nComing off a huge win emotional when a homecoming when and then you've got to travel or are you you come home and two weeks for Illinois state this is one of those games you got you're going to have to show up ready if you're going to want want a winning McKown\nExactly and I noticed that hasn't been an easy place to play for the Panthers they find a way to get it done a few times but in recent years but it you know it's\nThis is it they got to you know you and I is really the status control you know the last time they've entered in November and they got okay we've got to go for a home you know the right now they're still in a situation where for no would be a guaranteed to get in there's probably some wiggle room if they go three in one out seven form I get a man because of their strength and schedule but\nReally you know they got to be thinking here okay we get this one we get Illinois state and we're we're role and where they're playing they're playing for national seed right now that he's right last four games that they they haven't been in this spot before they're playing for national see\nPreviously entering November last week of October and November\nThey had been planning to get into the playoffs now they're playing for national the other three in one right now the seven want to leave that can be eight and three of them of the year that's a nationally they're going to get a by that\nThey don't get a seat it'd be a travesty so that's what they're playing for that's what they got their focus as well first of folks has got to be beaten western Illinois right you know looking for a week for whatever that is down the road but that's what that is what's on the table right now they're playing for national the that hasn't been something on the table last three or four years\nThey've been a plan to get into the playoffs at this point of the year now they're playing for national seat and that's got to be motivation especially the ... the plant really well right now it's I I I find it amazing you know because that loss of North Dakota state in the way it went down leading on that could have been devastating especially going to a very dangerous South Dakota team and they find a way to go in there\nAnd then they come home okay now you could say okay All right we're we're okay and you could have a slip up against the number two team but then it becomes like a boom they have another great performance so let's see if they can put another third rate performance down because this is that this is a reality\nThey can win out and there'll be a national see that's on the table it hasn't been before\nAnd the you know I think that that should be a great motivator\nJim Nelson sports writer with the Waterloo Cedar Falls courier on her village in VIP microphones here tonight at the ... P U and when you talk national see the reason the national seed thing is so important is that means you get by in that first weekend of the playoffs and it guarantees you a home game in week two after\nYou've had two weeks to prepare\nIt just you just rarely see a team get all the way to the the ... championship game if they had to play the opening weekend of the playoffs and win for to get to the championship game we've seen North Dakota state hosting hosted host\nIn round two three and four and get to the title game\nPlaying home games in the playoffs is important but I think also getting that first round by and not playing and having two weeks in between the end of the regular season in the playoffs is a huge advantage to\nYou you gotta look just like a look at northern Iowa last year you know last year you know a South Dakota state they handled them pretty good on the road that and the regular season and that was an outstanding game they win that game\nAnd then you know I I Am I Can't I have no proof of this but I guess some of the state took one look at Monmouth and then took okay we're just going to study northern Iowa that's who we are going to be ready for two weeks to get\nAnd I can't I have no proof of this but I guess ... state took one look at Monmouth and then took okay we're just going to study northern Iowa this who we are going to be ready for two weeks to get some eggs you're reading a different game plan coming up and it was like it was it was amazing you know South Dakota state was I mean they were great team\nYou and I was going to have to play another perfect game not a perfect game but another really strong game they didn't get that they lose\nBut the two weeks prepare that a week the rest they were saying that you know after that valley schedule your little banged up you get enough now you get a week\nOr the get another rest maybe get a couple of guys back that might not have been able to play right away or would have been maybe limited\nSo it's a huge advantage so like I said it's on the table and I think you and I got a you know this is something they gotta sees you know have a chance to seize and uh you know it's going to be difficult but next to the games ... I mean for the games real difficult but if you look on pay for the next two are probably the toughest Jim\nEverybody wants to Panthers to get a national seed we've been talking about it on campus I talked to a Christian Ellsworth and they got to go when this game and then just went out just win baby when that's why I've been saying all week\nOne of the biggest keys in my mind was the defense performance against a really good off of South Dakota steep last week I thought a lot of had to do Duncan birch moved over to will there were two injuries that linebacker ... do you think the coaching staff rules out the scene read linebackers at the same three positions this week\nI I think you're going to see a lot of same I think Blake Thomas was working his way back but I don't know if he's all the way back yet so I think we're going to see the same three they're going to see the same formation critical or like I think that's a long term injury I don't I don't know if we're going to see him again this year I Can't say that coach hasn't came out and said that but\nYou know I think that's going to be a long term injury so you're not going to see him so you're probably going to seek Kendrick in the middle and Duncan play a lot of the well so are those guys they played really loud well last week I think we're going to see is similar similar office here I often that likes to throw the running backs we look at their their to their three relieving receivers are running back although I think Clint\nI Can't Clint Clint is last names are I Can't spell it or can't pronounce it but I like to do that he is I I think he'd line right ... track of it there we go [noise]\nYou know the the radio guy the writer heat I just got a spelling you just got a right of it rack of its you know he uh he's or third leading receiver I think so but he's not he only got six curious I think he's got the splits on a lot but they're both listed as running backs obviously the machine's gonna you know a tough one but\nSo I think it's a very similar office I think we need to see the same concept up there they're going to they're going to really run the rotation through those defensive lineman so they're fresh and the fourth quarter I mean it's really worked well the last two weeks that you know I think that that is is this the bus depot the defective lie group that had in a while and they've really uh really planted a high level\nReally feel like they've come along to a guy like Eleanor Smith off the edge brought two wells been really good I mean it seems like we certainly are not lacking pass Russia's aren't we\nKnow and that's and that that's what the these are these are spread officer you know we've got some guys they're quick and get the ball and maybe disrupt and making a quarterback I get that ball my hands a little faster you know the guys are going to see this week is I Would say you know I think coach uh\nWe've got about a just twenty seconds left you gotta love the way he liked ... for you on a\nGreat guy to protect your ball that's gonna be a key to this game west Illinois and their three with our plus two and four losses or a minus eleven turnover margin so it's a key to direct the ball that's a key thing to watch this week that absolutely\nYou nailed it I think Scott Korb or give the Leatherneck so that was one of the keys for them is the when the turnover battle when we had him on earlier you guys are sharing the brain on that today we'll see you in ... on Saturday when you're there to cover\nYou and I put ... thanks for joining us Nelly you bet anytime gr well done as always Jim Nelson sports writer with the courier on the beat\nUp covering it you and I put both for the Waterloo Cedar Falls courier stay with us we have a coach Farley coming up next Chris doping that gr host the show tomorrow the sports that as I travel to McKown\nSong everybody\nSchool ...

at\nWell the first ... our our goal when we go out and recruit over just from from what has worked for us\nIs the first time I made a recruiter look at a recruit on film and particularly offensive line is is will he be a three year started for us and when will that be so I've I'm looking at ways going to be a year from now two years from now where is it physically\nAnd then it's up to us to get away with needs to be mentally but I'm looking at work where can he be will he be three years started to force because if you're a three year started college football northern Iowa that's a tremendous career\nAnd then I always tell them when I sit with him and say listen\nI Want to recruit unless I thought you were through your starter and it's up to you to be the for your starter so when that first year is that's on you if you come in and shape if you come and physically ready to go and we can get your mentally on the field\nThen we're going to play if if not then we'll read sure yeah we'll look at you the next year so it could be a you know as a richer freshmen as Richard sophomore but if you're a Richard sophomore two years on the program with the three years of starting\nThere's very few college football players that can walk off after college careers and say there are three years starters and there's even less for your starter so our goal is to get them there\nAs soon as we can but yet the timeline is is what will you be you know and that Richard sophomore year were what were you look like and then what we look like at your senior year and your fifth year\nAnd that's
