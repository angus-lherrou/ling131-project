role with the sports guy I'm Gary ... is our in Studio producer and co host of the program and he is the sports died let's talk some I was stateside loan football with Tommy birch he's on the beat up covering I was state cycling football for the Des Moines register\nA home in a way and that\nTommy the horn for all this last guy on the horn frogs took down or the the psych loans this past weekend just what went wrong at TCU\n[noise] I think it kinda starts and then for I Would stay with us and she was often says\nTend to bend the big bugaboo for the cycle on so far this sees that I'm you know it struggled massively against Iowa\nI'm it showed some signs of um of of life against Oklahoma an accurate but really not a ton of consistency a by any stretch of the main and then this this cycle and just couldn't get anything going at D.C use so um I was seats defense played great and I'm\nI'm just kept putting them in a position to win the game got a couple of turnovers force a couple of symbols\nI'm even got a big pick late in the game but\nNo matter how many times the defense came up with a big player got some ... ... ...\nAh keep it going and they kind of ... to a to a victory so that's the biggest from on Saturday and right now that that could be the biggest problem stopping I Wish they from I'm really getting things on track\nTom you mentioned ... struggles David Montgomery I thought he looked good before he got a little banged up ... touch on that later ... no one really had his first ... performance of the year didn't hit his check downs very well was inaccurate didn't do the long ball well what went wrong with that\n[noise] yeah I'm really not sure I mean that just didn't look like a kind of as normal south I mean kind of the ... the one thing um that really stood out to me was I think anything kind of a\nUm short you know some slant some some quick strike stuff like that he wasn't really too far off the mark but the second I Wish they tried to stretch the seals unless they got to pass interference call 'em they couldn't get anything going and that made them\nVery one dimensional offensively and to make things even worse when I came to no end in what he was doing is he had that one big rival of ah I think\nIt was twenty yards but outside of that I may may have to see was leaving the middle of the field so open and just daring him to run and then for whatever reason just wouldn't do it and um that really kind of force the issue for Iowa State so um\nYou know ... always kinda been heralded as of this guy with a great arm I'm kind of a little bit of a gunslinger mentality at great arm but I'm not always the great thing you know the great one with is accuracy so\nUm that's part of the reason why I was they love ... so much as it was accurate he took care of the football\nI'm ... and didn't really make bad decisions on the flip side ... could stretch the field like step knowing kidney but no he didn't against the few\nHe's got the potential to but uh she's definitely got to be able to be more accurate I think he's got to be able to showcases his lights a little bit if he's going to take the next step as a quarterback to\nTommy birch sports writer with the Des Moines register runner Billie Jean VIP hotline he covers high with states like loan football home in a way all season long for the Des Moines register you can read his work in the printed sports section of the register or on line at\nThe Des Moines register dot com what's the latest on David Montgomery I gotta believe everybody in in cycling country holding their breath waiting to hear if he's All right or not Twenty one carries a hundred and one yard before the injury\nAt TCU Saturday almost five yards carrying a touchdown he is a big part of that ... what's the latest on on running back David Montgomery\nYeah Matt Campbell said er during the big twelve ... conference today is day to day\nSounds like they're going to have the more info ah comes tomorrow the get news from the state is um sounded like he got an MRI and X. rayed both those came back pretty well it doesn't sound like\nIt's going to be anything long term made it almost sounds like from one Mac Campbell was saying is it may come down to how much pain David Montgomery\nIs willing to tolerate a if they'll be able to give it a go against ... stayed on Saturday and it fits that if that's kind of the the deciding factor on if David Montgomery poised I gotta match any well because\nI'm from covering the team being around coaches players\nUm people that know David Montgomery really well\nUm there were two things they constantly praise of one news his love of the game and to his house is so\nUm he he's a guy that led the nation and myth tackles last season he was constantly [noise] um you know getting brought down behind the line of scrimmage and turning that into something so um he's definitely proven its toughness so I'm at this point I think I Would\nBe more uh I I Would be more surprised if they have in mind Jeffrey is lying on Saturday I'm Ben ... is\nTelling me I'm like you I was impressed with the cycle on defense with what they did creating some some big turnover in that game but how concerned should cycle nation be with this I was laid off since they just\nAre not not real flashy struggling and the passing game only Seventy nine yards throwing it David Montgomery is a little banged up how concerned are they or should they be with with that cycling often moving forward\nI I think they should definitely be concerned I don't know if I Would be hitting to the panic button quite yet because the luxuries that no one is still I think kind of trying to find himself as a quarterback the potential is definitely there\nThe idea that David Montgomery even if he plays on Saturday the fact that ... thing that is a big concern I Wish they softened said wind is still um got a long ways to go I Will say kind of the silver lining when it comes to [noise]\nI guess the the struggles that off and says\nSome other big it's a tough times are kind of behind them now they're going to face if you have to buy like I was they aren't going to face\nA a a defense this town as talented is Texas Christian again so I think the schedule kind of soften a little bit more dry which they obviously having to face\nYou know Oklahoma's same West Virginia both those are a couple of very talented teams West Virginia is probably going to be coming to jak traced\nSame West Virginia both those are a couple of very talented teams West Virginia is probably going to be coming to jak trace stadium as a top ten teams but\nI'm the regardless I mean the ... the real tough challenges of of of of opposing defenses I Wish they had faced are probably behind them so\nI got I imagine if you're I Would say coach Mack Campbell that's what you're kinda preaching to your team as hey we got through kind of those tough times says the nonsense of unit now is kind of your chance to kind of get some momentum and start building start turning the corner\nTom you were on the conference call of the big twelve with Oklahoma State coach Mike ... de de de will want to say about the cycles\n[noise] nothing much I actually most of\nHis conference call 'em was hijacked by by a couple of people who are appeared to prank call it the big twelve so [laughter] I bought on he actually\nThey host nights Wang are ranked West Virginia or a week from Saturday they still have ... teams ranked Texas got to play if their place on November seventeenth so that leaves in those other five games\nThat are Tommy mentioned the\nTexas Tech Baylor Kansas State Kansas incarnate words you would have to win all five of those and not get knocked off unless you picked up one of those top twenty five teams\nIf I'm betting they beat Oklahoma State or West Virginia one of the new one of the next two weeks that happened All right well they usually seem to get on every year and it's a night game against West Virginia at home at that'd be great atmosphere stay with us our number two is coming up we'll talk some MCS and you and I put bowl when we come back after\nThe voice

C. S. teams and and one of them as a team that\nIs rank ninth and the country when you play them and that at a team that had beaten an F. B. S. opponent\nOr you gave yourself some pretty good pretty good uh points when you start thinking about what the committee is going to look at what voters look at what people like Jason beef grooms look at when when they're trying they're ranked teams\nYou got your big wins now they go to South Dakota and win that game than there really\nCould have turned some heads you know South Dakota to into right now to losses to rank teams will one right team in Kansas State let's say they really should have won that game but they get Missouri state at home they got to take advantage of that and we know beef loves Austin's sim as South Dakota's quarterback\nGet this you know you look at him is Eighteen and thirty five so just over fifty percent that's not great\nBut on the dating completion three hundred and thirty three yards and three ... so that's not that's\nPretty good when you talk Missouri state their quarterback Peyton ... was was a nominated for the often the player of the week the junior quarterback completed twenty to thirty two passes for two hundred and thirty two yards or he rushed for fifty two yards\nOr so he he's doing a pretty good pretty good job or it says the effort mark ... fifth career two hundred yards passing game as the bears improved a four and one\nAnd foreign versus F. C. S. programs when he was like eclipse two hundred yards through the year ... that's an interesting point on that are also\nUh for the the Missouri state bears or they had a wide receiver that also was a receiving a some oh he was nominated as new comer of the week the Mario Becca wide receiver from Missouri said he had seven reception for Ninety nine yards a\nSnagged seven catches on eight targeted throws including a pair of third down conversions and for catches for first downs he's a a true freshman so uh\nThey had some good things happen for them also in them as very valid football conference let's move on South Dakota thirty one southern Illinois twenty four South Dakota free safety Andrew Gray had a career high fourteen tackles\nEleven solo along with an interception and tackle for a lost in leading the coyotes to that thirty one twenty four victory over the ... in Carbondale gray and the south Dakota defense\nHad to defend over one hundred plates one hundred often see plays run by southern Illinois in that game and they also became the first team to hold SSI you to under forty one points this\nSince he plays run by southern Illinois in that game and they also became the first team to hold SSI you to under forty one points this season holding them twenty four\nShows how powerful that southern Illinois ... can be they can just get chick gassed real quick when you're running anywhere over Seventy five place at the high powered off and they read how many hundred something yeah the nuts and Andrew Gray of South Dakota was named the defensive player of the week\nFor his efforts yeah you you can't blame when you're on the field can you imagine the on the field for a hundred defensive stance swat\nAt the time that is a bunch a off sensibly or the south Dakota wide receiver ...

it's just it's crazy and the cubs were in that\nAh the Milwaukee Brewers up there one of the hottest teams in baseball right now we don't know how hot they well they won seven in a row to end the regular season and nine of their last ten\nTo catch the cubs and the cubs didn't play bad down the stretch they were they were eleven and six in their last Seventeen that's not bad it's yeah it's not bad at all but Milwaukee\nWas Nineteen and seven in September they won their last seven regular season games like you said they were nine and one in their last ten games I mean they just they were scorching hot\n... and today at Wrigley Field this afternoon they played the playoff game to see the tie breaker game to see who wins the central division and\nThe brewers were victorious\nThree to one group crew celebrating a and that means that they don't have to they don't have to play until after this wild card game is played tonight the other division tie between the Los Angeles Dodgers and

three hits today an elderly or only run was an anti Anthony ... home run yeah the ... is not there nobody looks good right now it's frustrating the pitching hasn't been bad when you give up three runs\nA subtle bad Randall pen wasn't great today but think about it you get paid your stroke who's hurt Brandon Morrow sir you played the whole season without basically one of your starting pitchers who was here a hundred and twenty six million dollar accusation um you know\nAnd you still one Ninety five games yeah in fact I I heard a pad and Ron talking about it on the radio broadcast that at at at spring training at spring training if somebody came up to and said hey\nYou can call off the regular season right now and take and you're going to win Ninety five games go Ninety five and thirty seven and and be in the playoffs you'd have you'd have taken it uses it will take we'll just we'll just take that and go right to the playoffs so it\nIt was a good year is a go if they get beat in the wild card game though\nIs it going to feel like [noise]\nLike it was a a an off year at a down year though I mean are you going to think man that that is as\nYou blew it you you had you had this good year going and then you get beat in uh in uh divisional playoff game to when you're division a hundred gain one sixty three and if you get beat in the wild card game man that's wow what a disaster you think there's going to be fans are going to say that\nOh the account of fans who say that I think it'd be a little bit of a let down but you you can't look at it is a wholly sort of really good year you Ninety five and sixty eight right now going into the postseason tomorrow but they often hasn't been there you're cold at the wrong time that's got to switch eventually granted they faced some really\nReally good pitching down the stretch and they'll probably see really good pitcher tomorrow but something's gotta gift and and it needs to give now\nHow 'bout cub nation cubs fan them or they

days it's inaccurate he's toast\nHe's denied the Supreme Court denied that about right\nNow let's go through the prosecutors memo like Sherman through Atlanta just stick with me no science to learn to charge Dr Ford is not offered it consistent account of when the alleged assault occurred\nNo science Elana charge Dr Ford has not offered it consistent account of when the alleged assault occurred\nIn July sixth tax to the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid eighties energize thirty letter to Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early eighties\nHer August seventh statement to the public refer said that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties but she crossed out the word early for reason she done who did not explain\nThis is because the lawyers get a hold of her you see and they're trying to make sure everything's consistent in order to get Kavanaugh\nSeptember sixteen Washington Post article reported that Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty to notice July six mid eighties July thirty early eighties\nAugust seven early eighties but then crosses out early but September sixteen when she's being a lawyer in the summer of Nineteen eighty two wow she not only remembers the year but she remembers the season\n\nSimilarly the September sixteen Arnold reported that notes from an individual therapy session in twenty Thirteen show her describing the assault as occurring in their late teens\nBut she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when the assault allegedly occurred she's not turned over her therapy records for the committee to review and yet ladies and gentlemen she's wave any privilege he has one of those records because she either gave them to or read them to the Washington Post there is no more attorney client privilege\nBut she's withholding why\nVoters common for victims to be on certain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season any particular year\n\nNow let's say the shoe was on the other foot and it was Kavanaugh would they tolerate that and say\nWhy at least credible no they wouldn't this is a big deal ladies and gentleman\nEarly eighties mid eighties early teens late teens\nThat's my memory loss\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name NO NAME was given in her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given in her twenties searching individual therapy notes\nWhy not\nDr Ford's husband claims to recall that she identified judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve by the way before I read on that's her husband ... irrelevant\nAt that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press as a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took doctor for over Thirty years the name or a sailor delayed disclosure of abuses common so this is not dispositive she writes she's nicer than I Am\n\nWhen speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific\nDr Ford testify but she told her husband about a quote unquote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she and former husband that she was the victim of a physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same\nIncident Dr Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question details I could help corroborate her account we talked about this last week the memory to me it's quite selective specific details\nSpecific details that are most harmful to Kavanaugh no details at all bunker operation\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party or how she heard about it she does not remember how\nShe got to the party she does not remember in what House the assault allegedly took place aware of that house was located with any specificity perhaps\nMost importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house\nHer inability to remember this detail racist significant questions\nShe told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club the club is more than seven miles from my childhood home as the crow flies and she testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from a childhood home\nShe also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both\nBut she couldn't remember\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently ... exiting the house she also has also described wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked\nBut she has no memory of who drove over or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as a driver\nNo one\nGiven this all took place before cell phones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did was that she called anyone else there after\nThat's convenient because then they can look at phone records\nShe does however remember a small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she testified that she had exactly one beer at the party was taking no medication at that time of\nThe alleged assault and we'll continue this after the break but as I said last week during the course of this questioning by the prosecutor it was devastating and\nThen we have the experts judicial analyst and a host to\nThe other one is she doing one is she doing she screwing up at those I mean this doesn't mean anything to the American means everything\nEverything as they say you\nListening to these more on\nAfter she testified said Kavanaugh's son he comes up these hot sun and they tell you this woman's incompetent but if she's a less confident\n...\nThe national debt is Mel over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops moved dollars some experts say another question is coming what will be left to viewer investments for your children are your grandchildren were you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but were gold and silver coins in an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nDr Ford is not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault writes the prosecutor\nAccording to her letter that Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking the other party goes downstairs while she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone sooner or later the Feinstein she heard them talking to others\nIn her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nIn her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other persons with the house we're talking with them\nQuote unquote but she testified that doctor that actually made the judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain that she could not hear that conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNoticed she never said she turned down the music either that any of them turned on the music\n[noise] her account of who is that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post and counter therapy notes\nThere were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted she told the Washington Post that the notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter that Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEntered testimony she said there were four boys and additionally link Kaiser and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward Dr Ford listed Patrick PJ ...\nAs a bystander quote unquote in her statement to the political refer and enter July sixth tax to the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call him a bystander she did not lists legal and Kaiser even though they are good friends labeling Kaiser's presidents should have been more memorable than PJ smart as\n\nDr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about our memory raises further questions about her credibility because we're talking about things that are recent a few months ago not thirty six years ago\nDr Ford struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post Dr\nFord cannot remember she showed a full or partial set of therapy notes for the Washington Post reporter she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter\nThe actual therapists notes her own summary of those notes\nThe Washington Post article that portions of her therapists notes were provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but in her testimony doctor for I cannot recall was that she summarize the nose for the reporter or showed her the actual records actually was even more and I took notes during the testimony to\nShe thought she may have summarized them over the phone or couldn't remember whether she physically handed in anything over I mean it was really preposterous we're talking about July, July sixth\n\nShe does not remember if she actually had a copy and the notes when she texted the Washington Post ... account on July six Dr Ford set in their first what's at message to the post that she quote\nHad therapy notes talking about unquote the incident when she contacted the post tip line\nShe testified she had reviewed a therapy notes before contacted opposed to determine whether the ... whether they mentioned anything about the alleged since then but could not remember if she had a copy of these notes as she said in her ... message or merely review them inner therapists off and on wait a minute\nSo she couldn't remember on July sixth if she had a copy downloaded a copy of or therapists notes or had reviewed them in her therapist's office does anyone believe that\n\nShe's providing information to the Washington Post and she can't remember a few months ago if she downloaded them from the Internet or if she had reviewed them in her therapist's office\n\nCan you imagine if Kavanaugh said this about drinking back in high school I Can't remember of say\nWhat drinking at night I don't remember I had three cans or six I don't remember too are far then we can hear call me saying and it's a big thing so I Would ask call me and I would ask Blumenthal Mr Vietnam vet not I would ask\nHim is a little why\nWhat does that evidence of they say moralize\nLadies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you this is not a memory Aisha this is an attempt by her lawyers and I think her now to put a round peg in a square hole or square peg in Iran how you get the point\nNo sense this was July sixth there wasn't thirty six years ago\nBanging around how you get the point\nIt makes no sense says for July sex wasn't thirty six years ago wasn't even six months ago\n\nDr Ford refused to provide any of our therapy notes that the committee and that is outrageous they should be subpoenaed she waived her privilege on these therapy notes\nDr forwards explanation 'em by the way I'm sure Shelley White House White House ... what are we supposed to\nDo a lot of can't rely on\nTrack where they actually asked by God\nBy the way I have another drink wait a minute not in the public\nDr Ford's explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions\nShe claimed originally that she wished for her story to remain confidential\nBut the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post's was the first person other than a therapist or a husband to whom she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker she
