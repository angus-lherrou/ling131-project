another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because today we're going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr pain 'cause there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect that daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr ... ... is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative\nDaily stress has on our bodies for those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health\nHe's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a born a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right\nAt a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel that she has the muscles get an artery bone up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that our results in in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramped in their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or hunting calcium supplement or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does build your ... but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't that diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if ... that's right and I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a ball\nIn is due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and a calcium supplements you know they buy the health food started driving right but these things don't absorb and the body it's time for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the calcium in like a Tom's\nFirst of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a Tom is an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself has that been absorbed by\nSea because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it's natural\nThan the differences is that\nA powder and what happens is you put it in hot water and you miss it up and you drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem as well\nYeah because when calcium and museum earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says offense to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the magnesium being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all this thing\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better\nI have thousands of people are ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ... the pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time in Iraq I mean this is really amazing\nI Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium in tried Dr ... formula\nThere's a special toll free number you can call it's one eight hundred for eight eight eight one one six ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium

special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this is only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred\nFor eight eight eight one one six\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain in stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you is lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd human reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to kill max formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred\nFor eight eight eight one one six\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks this book is packed with vital information about why your calcium needs change with age count seems ruling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression for tea it's all\nNeeds change with age Cal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression for tea it's all in this very informative book\nCritic and I'd like to do something very special for listeners today so I'm going to give away an extra free bottle formula one hundred color\nWill thank you for doing that Dr pain 'cause I really appreciate it host this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred for

six I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred for eight eight eight one one six\nIf you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nAnd that is amazing and when I used the with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes he was in us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that to such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication so\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium needs them in the system so that very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body and experience and because of the fish in the museum\nIs also blocking further absorption\n[laughter] so it's really it's really a rat race I think it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way you get nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight

just got here at the end and then you get all these young kids think that means something entirely different that I think communism socialism is all the wealth and prosperity and freedom you have now plus some free stuff yeah that is what I think it means\nRight and they don't realize just a few elite that are in power control the masses and and the fuel lead all have the money and take whatever

American discourse I thought the ... I thought President Trump was pitch perfect and I think the caller from Schumer and Pelosi should have matched with the president did but unfortunately it did not\n... I Want to hold up again this front page from yesterday or the Washington Post because I got to say I was really shocked by it I fully expected at this I suspect arrested\nAnd he said it said bombs just suspect outspoken supporter of Trump that's the headline on the Washington Post and I went back and looked at the post\nFrom last year after Bernie Sanders supporter attacked a Republican baseball practice in severely wounded Steve ...\nKnow headline there about outspoken supporter of standards so I got the question is is it fair to draw that kind of blanket ... front page suspect outspoken supporter of Donald Trump\nYeah I probably would have written the different headline if I worked at the Washington Post but having said that um look I Do not think it is a stretch\nTo argue that ah the president's comments\nTo stir the pot even further [noise] uh I I agree with the congressman the president's got too much credit\nAnd I agree that there are people who overstep the line I I was outspoken when people are interrupted Sarah Sanders dinner or secretary Nielsen center I thought that was inappropriate [noise]\nBut when the part of the United states in actually questioning peoples' patriotism and calling them enemies of the people and you know is saying pitch perfect words in the wake of a tragedy but\nThe people and you know is saying pitch perfect words\nIn the wake of a tragedy but then goes into a rally and continues to do by the end and blame people I think\nThat is worth examination I think it is worth exploration I think we can all do a better job in our own lives as being more civil and and it being vigorous dissenters and at an arguing with one another politically\nBut checking how we do it I Would hope that the president would would take some of this to hurt us well Jason\n... you know when when Congress in ... trucks about the president's pitch perfect my initial reaction was which president because it didn't seem this week because if\nThere were two presidents first of all there was teleprompter Trump let's take a look\nWe must never allow political violence to take root in America cannot run around and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nBut then there was Twitter Trump here he is at three fourteen am friday morning funny how lowly right at CNN and others can criticize me well\nEven blaming me for the current state of bombs yet when I criticize them go wild and scream it's just not presidential do you think it's fair to say that there are two very different presidential towns here\nOh absolutely crystals after two years of a President Trump I think that's something people have come to expect um I Do want to say\nA referring to the headline the newspaper you put up\nIf you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and social media that is why that headline is why\nHe does not trust the mainstream media to treat him\nFairly and he is going to continue the social media so long as the mainstream media treats them in that fashion as supporters are going to appreciate his his social media I think that is exhibit a right there I think that we would like the country with like public officials\nTo exercise some restraint and not jump the gun when we see these tragedies happened\nThey'd like Hillary Clinton to do it they'd like Eric Holder the door and they like President Trump to do it in President Obama to do it\nAs well that would be nice if they did behave that way or the motives seemed to very when these incidents happened you mentioned the softball practiced shooter the guy who shot up the Annapolis newspaper had a different motives I'm looking at maybe ...

with the cost of living my Republican colleagues is you do not have a voting record to run on that is actually prioritize hardworking middle class families that's number one number\nTwo as you look at the data Chris with what you put on the board there oh I never look at any one poll data on our side momentum on our side the energy is clear early voting is up all across America as long as people continue to turn up in ... we will do well the other thing is we're making sure that the American people know about their voting records of our Republican colleagues when it comes to health care\nVoting to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions and being an agenda forward that would have actually slapped in age tax on people between the ages of fifty and sixty four\nResulted in increasing health care premiums deductibles and out of pocket costs of the American people that's what we're running on it again an agenda anchored around for the people around our candidate\nWe've been talking this hour about the tone the ugly telling our politics has taken and I want to play some ads that both of your campaign committee or the two chairs of the campaign

views on the issues are legitimate and there are contrast that we need to run so people understand what folks believe and I think it is fair to say that she is not in the mainstream of uh of Michigan politics\nCongress and little Honda here is an ad that your rope and you're sharing the D triple C ran against Republican Congressman Mike Kelley in Pennsylvania\nTwo thousand ten car dealer might Kelly's elected to Congress and while they're in his net worth increased by millions and so it's no surprise he helped give special tax breaks to car dealers when like himself\nBut congressman the specific group you cite for making that report the center for Responsive Politics says in fact his net worth has dropped dramatically during the time in office that has a resin\nLudicrous when we see our Republican colleagues voting for a tax package dubbed by the American people as a tax scam that was prioritizing corporations and the most wealthy in America over hardworking middle class families were going to call them out on the record\nAnd you're out of the question but sir that's his record I'm Talking about his network and that's a fact\nWell look to the point of your question I think that all committees and all of ... out there that are investing in\nCampaign ads across the country that they need to be respectful of tone but I Would agree with Steve that when we're looking at voting records that I think that that is fair game as well and we need to make sure that we're all looking to see how we can make sure that we're having a better conversation with the American people whether it's the last nine days of this cycle or going into next election as well\nAll right I got a little bit over a minute left and I want you to share at a place where you got about thirty seconds you you've talked about the economy as we talked about healthcare immigration but to what degree is this election really about Donald Trump either pro war against a Congress and law and you go first\nLook Chris I think all across the country are candidates are not really talking about this president much\nThere is no one that's going to talk more about Donald Trump Donald Trump\nWhich gives our democratic candidates the opportunity to connect with their personal stories and talked about an agenda that has built around for the people and how we're going to be able to help lower prescription drug prices\nLower health care costs Mui strong infrastructure package and clean up Washington DC with all the corruption our candidates are doing well and it's because of our candidates the Democrats will win the majority in the U.S house of representatives\nA German Stivers you have thirty seconds\nWell I think this election is about results versus dysfunction already talked about our economic success we have more to do on infrastructure lowering healthcare costs but\nUh the dysfunction the other side would bring their healthcare agenda when kick a hundred and Seventy nine

questions have a conversation about what's important to you with your retirement journey aid for for for two for plan\nEight four four four to four plant the teams got more than a hundred years of combined experience so a great resource for you to tap into and without further ado Tony Jason gentleman welcoming how're you\nDoing great marker whether it's getting cooler So Paul winter's coming in but change of seasons is nice\nYeah he'll um are great to be in ... well good good good you know obviously this hundred years of combined experience and I know we kind of pick on Marty when he's on here for being an elder statesmen so how did you guys divide that up if he's like fifty percent of the [laughter]\nThe more like sixty [laughter] other uh oh I've been in the business for about ten years now OK Marty ... eighty one minute since eighty seven and Tony Blair\nNineteen years myself okay All right All right so you guys got a ton of experience so well look parlay some of that into you know what we've been doing here recently and I don't know it's just kind of fun to do it as we've been using analogies ... whatever you want to call them ... you know retirement planning\nAnd the financial side to other things in life and this time we're going to use the marathon the running a race type of analogy here so are you there you guys were you ever runners in school or anything\nI was a sprinter okay\nAll right well I didn't go any further than two hundred meters okay [laughter] I played soccer but that's a\nLot of running in soccer now there is well I was the defenders so they're all going to have to run\nAnd go any further than two hundred meter okay\n[laughter] I played soccer but that's a lot of running and soccer out there is well I was a defender of them out and run on the other guys at the fender goalie so you're a big fella too so yeah that I can\nSee that so All right you know actually sprinting is good because we maybe you've heard this phrase before their retirement as a marathon not a sprint right so is the long haul there was talk a little bit about some things that may be an athlete would go through for preparing for a marathon as well as you know the retirement side planning and preparation obviously key to both things\nOh absolutely you know when people are planning for a marathon you know it's at least the people that I've talked to have done those things you know it is it's a cycle of\nFiguring out when you're going to get your training session in your water where are you going to carry with you I have a limited amount of space and you don't really want to carry a lot of weight with you you know a lot of marathoner spend upwards of six months if not more\nYou know mix it in days with light runs my sister in law she does a lot of long distance running okay you know it's a mix of light runs in some long runs and then you kind of build yourself up to the marathon time and\nYou know some days you'd do shorter faster runs I guess to just keep your muscle groups you know reacting differently but you know it's similar to retirement planning planning and preparation is the cornerstone\nOf what we do you know what sets us apart from a lot of other financial professionals who may just you know manage money or manage investments we spend a lot of time on the planning and preparation you know and it's not just\nFiguring out where your money's invested its tax management strategies you know do we need to factor in the state management strategies\nBut what's really important you know the short term things in relation to like race prep or retirement ... management okay good point if if you don't want to just come in and you don't have a full retirement analysis you just wanted to kind of pieces of the show and and apply it to your daily life\nFirst and foremost where's your debt that can be a real killer because what people don't realize is like for a marathon runner it's almost like drinking salt water\nYou know you'd say well why would you drink salt water will eventually the salt is going to dry out it has a reverse effect of not really hydrated and he was going to dehydration over time and that's what that does is it\nThe hydrate your portfolio over time because the interest rate that you have on debt is a permanent loss you know you can put money in the market and it may go up and may go down at me stay the same\nBut that is going to have an interest rate that is permanently losing money sure you have it\nA certain kinds of debt like home mortgage you know or a better form of debt because hopefully you're also building equity in your home your kind of putting money away towards that dry but other debt credit card student loans and things that really kill people and\nYou know you need to make sure that when you're doing these planning you're not making haphazard choices with investments and ignoring the debt side of it what do you think Jason\nYeah I agree with Tony another kind of analogy use are kind of a taking a look at what a marathon is versus retirement planning as you also want to get good feel of the course that you're running same thing with retirement plane out there's a lotta hills in the marathon or downhill or a lotta turns\nYou want to make sure that you're planning for that when it comes to your preparation it's the same thing with your retirement planning\nAnd that's why we run the retirement analysis for our clients and for him by the walk to our door\nBecause basically what we want to do is get a good picture of what that course it's going to look like for you through retirement\nFind out where the hills are where the valleys are where the corners are so that we can set up your expectations and investments to make sure that you're getting the highest cans of achieving your goals finishing the race\nIt's twofold like Jason said the retirement analysis you know comes in different levels it's not just a one size fits all\nBut it's there to help you know prospective clients and current clients what is also there to help us it makes us better planners when we have a a better picture of what you're going through and that's why if you are looking at the planning and preparation side of things\nYou know let us know in our office will send out to you it's not just to have come in and we'll sit down and who knows what's gonna happen will send you a package of preparation materials some questions in there and also include a checklist of items to bring in and so if you're in the planning and preparation phase you just don't know where to start\nJust call in and ask for one of our preparation packets and will be more than happy to get that sent out to you\nKnow that some great points that you guys make especially even helping your own selves get through that you know planning and ... obviously a huge key to just about anything in life and of course we're just kind of using it from an athletic standpoint here today\nBut I think Tony brings up a great point so let me go ahead and just do this if you'd like to go ahead and get started and you do need some planning and ... and as Tony mentioned they've got some resources to help you with that reach out to them a day for for for two for playing and\nTell me if they want to come in and do that what's that whole process going to look like\nSure it's going to be reaching out and leaving us a message for us to contact you so leave us a phone number or you could even leave us an address if you want us to send the material to her in the email\nAnd we'll reach out to you to send you that preparatory information that packet of questions and kind of a checklist of items and you bring that in in the first meaning there's really I mean consider it's almost like a first date you know\nMade us we're getting to meet you [laughter] you know we want to make sure that we're right fit for you and your right fit for us so it's a lot of questions and answers there isn't really a wrong answer you can give us a your answer might be I don't know I don't care you know these are all\nThe sounds like my state [laughter]\nAnd these are legitimate\nThings because when we are putting together our recommendations we have a fiduciary duty to put her client's best interest first or prospective clients best interest first so we need to know a little bit more vouchers and just the numbers\nYou know it's more than just investments\nAnd so in that point in preparation that first meeting is getting to know a little bit better getting to know us as taking down some information and then it takes us I don't know roughly a week sometimes a little less sometimes a little more depending on the complexity of the case and\nWe put together an analysis of talk written review of what the rest of your life is looking like based upon what we know today\nAnd then we have some recommendations maybe to leave things alone or maybe to tweak a couple of things where we think you'd be advantaged by making some changes\nWell if you'd like to get started a day with this process it's pretty easy to do folks were got much more to come today on the program a void take a break let me remind your job this number down pen pencil crayon\nI line or whatever it is that you have the right with ketchup pack and I don't care but right down to eight four four four to four plan get yourself on the counter no cost around the gays and it gets started telling you just laid out a really simple\nNow maybe you want to do some of those things maybe you're comfortable doing some of those things but your body just isn't allowing you to do those things so we want to make sure that when it comes to retirement planning that we're focusing on that you know it's not just about\nHow much can we grow your assets or is the money gonna last as long as you do we want to make sure that we're factoring in those goals and dreams when we are doing the planning to make sure that that money to last for the rest of your life\nSo again a really great thing to do would be to sit down with one of us go through what you want to do I mean tell us about your goals your dreams is it a second home do you want to take up golf maybe and tried to meet some of your friends the golf because you never had the time to do it before\nThose types of things we want to incorporate into the plan the best way to do that is sit down with us let's talk about it put the plan together see whatever time it looks like for you and then it just what you're doing investment wise and make sure that you're achieving all that but this time when I like to do is offer\nYou the opportunity to come in for a complete financial review well offer this review for free were really passionate about making

commission with your current plan what about tax implications on your savings is there a way to save money in taxes down the road by planting proactively now\nDo you have an income plan in place to be sure that you are in danger of running out of money if you end up living for Thirty years or more and retirement\nObviously there's a lot we need to discuss and we found that most people just haven't

those answers from the guys have for for\nFor to for a plan to get yourself on the counter come and have a conversation obviously good guys to talk to you as well so gentlemen let's talk about major life events around out in the program\nFor this week we're all going to encounter these there are some significant changes that we all hit in our life journey and of course and fortunately there is no different when we're heading in towards retirement and maybe it's in the pre retirement stage maybe it is even in retirement but these things can happen so let's talk about a few of these and some ideas to look out for\nTony let's kick it off with a job change significant life event that can be especially if it's a major career change\nOh absolutely and you know the first thing to distinguish there is whether it's when you say job change it kinda brings to mind is it a forced job change or a voluntary job change you know and it makes a pretty big difference from a financial standpoint a force job change could have come out of the blue if you were laid off or something like that\nWhile a voluntary one hopefully you've been taking steps to prepare yourself\nThat's really where an emergency fund comes into play\nYou know why it's really important in the financial planning process to have an emergency fund just in case it is not a voluntary job change it to force job change that what you've got some pushing the get you through it it's a little less stressful and allows you to focus on you know is is the point of retirement or is this the point that you need to get another job\nNext you really want to consider any four one K. or pension that you have\nTo make sure you explore the options make sure you're not being forced out of the plan\nOr any fees are changed or you know there was any issues there and then you start planning on well what's this job change going to look like is there any income changes do you need to adjust your spending new clothes you need new transportation is your commute change and you have to move\nYou know all these things can be some of the financial aspects that come along with the job sharing so if you're thinking one might be in the near future reinforced door voluntary you know start putting together a checklist of those things you know get tired and playing income spending those are the three things that you really start focusing on\nYeah definitely some good points there to think about it for a job changes on the horizon what about a divorce case and now you know more and more of it is what it is in our society right the rate is but I don't know fifty percent or something like that but it does happen as well for pre retirees and retirees sometimes\nYeah unfortunately it does occur much more frequently than it did in the past and when a divorce happens it can really hear the whole retirement plan just in general your finances are all\nTopsy turvy during that time and especially when it comes to your retirement planning all of a sudden\nSome things that you may be having for expectations have completely changed and the one thing that you have to do look at is if you have a four one K. potentially there'd be acquired you're on that where your spouse gets half of your you get half of your spouse's same thing with a pension any IRAs for that regard as well\nSo you're basically looking at really completely changing what you had for expectation financially moving forward\nAnd the other thing that you want to think about when something like this occurs is beneficiary information on a lot of your accounts\nYou know I don't know depending on how the divorce does I'm assuming that you don't want to have your life savings go to your ex spouse after a divorce or ... [laughter] yeah I'd say about a hundred percent of the time that I actually come into encounter with that it's not been that way but\nThe way to take a look at your beneficiaries because that's an easy thing to kind of mess because so much focus is on how the assets gets split up and what goes into that you're going through proceedings for the divorce that\nThat one little thing about who do you want this money to go to in case of your death\nCan sometimes get nasty and you want to make sure that you're setting that up accordingly when something like a divorce happened so that you're taking care of any children that are potentially from the marriage and making sure that you get the assets that you get to keep\nGoing to the people that you wanted to go to so again basically it's a really tough time it's really great to sit down with an advisor during this time to look at your different options that you have available what kind of laws are in place you might have to speak to an attorney of course\nIs you're changing from the accumulation phase of your life where you've been contributing into plants trying to grow your assets and grow that nest egg as much as possible to get to retirement to the distribution phase of your life\nSo even though one part of your life is ending at that time a whole another part of your life is starting up and\nFor most people are for a lot of people you could potentially be in retirement longer than you are actually working because we're living much longer than we have in the past and asked an rations\nAnd so that's a big part of your life that you know if you quit your planning when you retire because you think that's the end ah you got a long ways to go\nYeah no for sure and I think you know how we graduate high school or college I think we should add that new term to it because now we have commencement\nAh when we move from one face of the accidents and beginning of one thing and it started something new so maybe we should have retirement commencement [laughter] to where we are going in and my faith and move into the next one but I think it's a good point you know you you don't want to treat it necessarily at the finish line I mean you could have that as a\nKind of a milestone goal if you will but I think some people and that's the kind of the point here is they think about that is the endgame and then it's like well now what do I do so you need to walk into that with a plan with a destination a you know something in line and things that you want to retire to which we've talked about many times are on the show\nAre also believing that retirement can solve all your problems\nIs also another ... easy way people can mess themselves up and retirement just because you hit retirement doesn't mean like everything goes away maybe some of that work stuffed shore but\nWell yeah a lot of stuff that will go away as any work related stress that you might have or or again you mentioned a lot of people think that you're going to have a lot more free time during retirement but again\nAs you mentioned a lot of people's lives get much busier once you get to retirement because you've got to think you know when you're working in your in the workforce and and you're waiting to get to retirement if that you're in game to get to retirement and enjoy it\nAnd have all these dreams and goals and aspirations of what you want to do in retirement\nA lotta times different types of stresses will take over how are the market's doing how my accounts doing can a supplement my income\nLine in retirement am I going to run out of money how long they're going to live as health issues going to become a factor so there's different types of stresses once you get to retirement and you just got to mitigate I'm just like he did with the stresses that you had while you were working so when it comes to retirement it's it's not like\nYou're going to be completely free of everything [laughter]\nYou know how many do and get a whole lot longer to exactly but\nYou know people thinking generalities when it comes to working versus retiring and no longer having to work it's like again let's take the analogy of school\nHaving a snow day you know that'd be great to have a snow day but when you get to retirement there still responsibilities that you're going to have and things she need to do\nAnd you're gonna have to make sure that you're keeping your income stream investments in check and monitoring them\nTo make sure that they're going to last as long as you do so yeah unfortunately once you get to retirement it's not like winning a negative jak pot and being set for the rest of your life you want to make sure that you're still maintaining and keep it in that focus on your life your expenses your investments\nYeah I agree with you Jason and you know it's kinda hearkens back mark to that first topic we talked about putting it as a a retirement as a destination rather than the beginning as a ... of another part of life\nYou know believing that retirement will solve all the problems is very much like treating it like a finish line and it should be relaxing though it shouldn't be a whole different level of stress or new stresses your retirement should be what you want to make of it\nAnd you know if you put obstacles in front of yourself by not having a good plan that's where you will have the stressors of okay workplace income is less what do I do now\nWhat am I going to pay for health insurance what uh what about record minimum distributions coming up what about taxes what about this or what about that you know you put your own obstacles in front of you financially and there's ways to solve them\nAnd you know create a plan so that those obstacles don't have to be such huge mountains that you have to get over like we said retirement should be fun and you should be what you make of it\nAnd it gets a whole heck of a lot more fun and a whole heck of a lot less stressful if you've done some prior planning to get you to the point where\nHey hitting that retirement ... isn't a stressful thing it's like a load of bricks just came off of your shoulder here's what we're going to do right now we\nAre very very passionate at premier advisors about our community being well prepared for retirement and what we want to do is extend the opportunity right now to you to help make sure that you're well prepared\nWe're going to offer complimentary financial review if you call in the next Fifteen minutes have at least a hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nWhat we're going to talk to you about retirement income meets wherever incomes going to come from\nAnd also how you'll outpaced inflation pay as little as possible and taxes and make sure truly that you don't outlive your money\nNow you might say I don't really have to call them the next Fifteen minutes and yes that's true you could probably take care of it next week or next month but here's kind of the real deal\nWe've been coaching people on retirement planning for very long time and what we've learned that is it's very easy to procrastinate or get distracted so if you don't start the process now there is a very good chance you're probably won't do it at all so the first coaching lesson that we can teach you is to encourage you to take that first up right now\nFor almost everybody that's the hardest part it's kind of a hurdle that you need to get over but from there it's really not a painful process so again like going to a doctor you got a schedule they appoint won't the doctor in order to go in and get things done and and figure everything out so if you're ready to finally get a plan in place give us a call right now\nWill go ahead and take advantage of this opportunity from the team at premier advisors

... bean tuned in radio Google Play or on player FM now you know\nBack in December a massive tax cut package was signed into law the president said that it was going to be a big boost to middle income Americans now if you remember that caught was included in a one point five trillion dollar package and it became Mr Trump's signature piece of legislation on economic policy by\nMiddle class Americans say they have not felt much of an impact in part because three quarters of the tax cuts went to corporations and high income earners\nAs a result middle class Americans have rallied around the Trump tax cuts in the way the president and congressional Republicans had hoped so Mr Trump has found another way to get the tax cuts back on the news before the midterm elections by pledging to deliver another round very soon Mr Trump began talking about this new tax\nCut last weekend telling supporters that he was preparing another middle class caught on top of the ones already in place and that Congress would pass it imminently trouble is Congress will do no such thing if not in session until after the elections and no one on Capitol Hill expects a tax\nCut are any guide to pass\nIn the lame duck session at the end of the year instead the White House and congressional Republicans are scrambling a bit after\nMr Trump's apparently off the cuff declarations to lay the tracks for another tax cut if Republicans hold on to control of both the house and the Senate in November\nData from the tax policy center suggests that a true ten percent cut in tax liability for households earning Seventy five thousand dollars a year or less would reduce your revenues by more than three hundred billion dollars over the course of a decade if we put a broader definition of middle class\nInto the mix it would escalate that cost considerably by the way it did we mentioned the new deficit has now at nine hundred and eighty five billion dollars and it's about two hundred billion dollars more than what

...\nWelcome back to the ... hour week in review here at the top fifty forty KFC all\nI'm your host Michel ... you know while I write and deliver the business news end do long form business interviews each weekday my real job is that of owning an advertising and marketing agency our job is to use the tools and talent we have to create desire on the part of consumers for our clients products and services and I've been doing that for a long time\nWell I'm sharing that with you is because I Want to offer some marketing tips for those of you who are affiliated with small businesses now it doesn't matter if you're an owner manager or a worker the following bits of information can help your business when this coming holiday season\nIs coming up on a Saturday following Thanksgiving it's small business Saturday and it's the eleventh year this nation wide event it's all part of a promotion through American Express and fed ex to promote and celebrate small business and they give you some great tools to help make it a great pick off for the holiday season\nNow if you're a member of a local chamber of commerce you might want to reach out to them and find out if they are already involved in small business Saturday if so collaborate with them if not I've got a number of marketing tips right here to help you beat out the big box or online stores\nBut first let's consider the impact of small business Saturday on business check these numbers\nAccording to a recent sales fuel survey last year twenty three percent of us adults shopped at a locally owned a business on small business Saturday\nNow while that number is lower than the thirty three percent of adults who shopped online during Cyber Monday more than half of those online shoppers said they would rather shop at a small locally owned a business if the price and product quality is similar\nAnd get this millennials age twenty five thirty for make up the largest single segment of small business Saturday shoppers had nearly twenty five percent\nSo quick worrying about all this demographic data that says all they do shop on line they don't\nSo how can you grab their attention from millennials to boomers let's go\nFirst of all you got to start now more than half of last year's small business Saturday shoppers also shopped at brick and mortar stores on Black Friday\nThis behavior means they might be tapped out in less motivated to shop on small business Saturday and to avoid this create a marketing plan that includes consistent outreach from now until small business Saturday\nAnd what should that plan include here's some ideas\nHow 'bout some in stores signage remind shoppers that Saturday is small business Saturday I got 'em in the store reminder to come back because more deals are coming up number to social media outreach the same here remind folks that dollar spent locally stay local it really does matter\nBack is sour\nMe is a candidate for the secretary of agriculture here in\nThe great state of Iowa his name is Tim Gannon he has been with us da ... years and get this kid's\nHe's a real farmer which is kind of unique in this world welcome to the business news hour gym good to have you here great to be with you\nWell let's talk a little bit about you down state ballot candidates have sometimes the issue of name recognition and your secretary of agriculture the secretary of agriculture which is such an important part of Iowa's economy\nWhat's what are the challenges about being down the ballot\nWell you don't get as much attention as governor or somebody running for Congress but it is definitely an important office for the state of Iowa given agriculture's important role both in our identity as a state but also definitely in our economy not just the farm income which is important but the way that farm income then gets\nRolled around the economy or every small town does better when farmers are doing better our manufacturing does better when farmers are doing better in our state budget is stronger when farmers are doing better\nAnd this is if I remember correctly from the news pieces that we've done in the past is is either the fifth or sixth year that farm income has\nBeen down to that be accurate yeah it's been down five of the last six years and USDA back in ah February when they did their twenty eight team farm income forecast a predicted was going to be down again this year and that was before what we've seen a happened to prices because of the trade disputes\nStruck a little bit about the trade disputes why should people care whether or not there is an issue out there\nWith um soybeans being a attacks to or not being purchased by the largest user of soybeans and the world which is China and they're going elsewhere such as Brazil and other places to get there so it means what does that mean to Iowa in Iowa\nFarmers swell Iowa farmers and other other soybean producers are in the United states spend a lotta years building the market uh\nCreating the relationships with end users in China or so that they would know that American farmers produced a quality affordable or inconsistent products that they could uh by year in and year out knowing it would be there\nAre so so what has happened with them deciding not to buy soybeans from the United states because of the terrorists they put on our beans is uh\nThey've gone elsewhere like you said Brazil or the one that really a grab my attention or you know I work a year's USDA while while Secretary Vilsack was without their leading things\nAnd that was a lot of crop briefings I sat through in those eight years time ah everything from how the weather in the southern hemisphere affects the supply and demand of wheat in the northern hemisphere to\nA a weather in Egypt or impacting the cotton crop there and and what that meant for cotton prices in the United states but never wants to those eight years of crop briefings is I hear the words Russia and soybeans using the same sentence\nBut back in June after trying to put tariffs on our soybeans or one of the headlines from Bloomberg or Reuters was China the source records supply of soybeans from Russia and I don't know if that's a lot or a little\nUh comparatively but it goes to show you what they're going to do to try and survive without the savings that they had come to depend on from the United states\nAnd because there are other markets are this is impacted none of them the price of soybeans would also as you go down the economic ladder that impacts of farmers that impacts their ability to buy the equipment to expand their their operation\nAnd ah and yes\nThe current administration said oh wait we've got to fix for you I Will give you a penny per bushel for\nCorn and what ends up to be not\nA dollar eighty four for a bushel of soybeans but really eighty two cents is that accurate\nThat well that's accurate except that ends up being just a ... a bushel of corn 'cause they gotta they also do that if I didn't have the same way they do for the disarming production yep a I think they realize that they have created a problem for farmers and for a condom use like Iowa that depend so much on farmers are but I I don't think that that they've\nUh that they really understand the damage that they'll do to our entire economy if they continue with these policies that will keep prices down and trade is definitely one part of it but also with what they've done in biofuels\nA push the price for corn and beans down and so that's why I've been talking to you know like in the short term the things that will definitely help farm income would be fixed and\nBiofuels policy and fix and trade policy uh but I don't think that the administration Washington DC right now is listening a genuine because they see the stock market doing relatively well they see unemployment low or so they don't understand that when farmers are struggling means all the small towns or in a struggle [noise] my dad on a John Deere store\nOr during the Nineteen eighty so my first lesson in economics was\nThey're struggling means all the small towns or in the struggle [noise] my dad on to John Deere store\nOr during the Nineteen eighty so my my first lesson in economics was if farmers aren't doing well it it's tough on the rest of rural Iowa and not in in Iowa then if if clipping dealers aren't selling machinery means are folks who work in the deer and case plants may not be working either and it kind of gets to be a triple whammy where\nFarmers aren't doing while the small businesses that depend on them aren't doing well and eventually are manufacturing a suffers and just with what they've talked about ah in the last in income from low prices due to trade disputes Iowa State researchers have said\nThat could be as much as a hundred and ten million dollar hit a to state tax revenues and\nAnyone who's followed the state budget the last couple of years knows we haven't had an extra hundred and ten million dollars a laying around and we've had to short change education we've had a a major cuts to our regents universities uh the the issues with\nPaying a providers especially rural doctors and and small town hospitals for services provided by Medicaid all these issues then get impacted if the state budgets not doing well\nThe state budget is important for every island of what we're talking with Jim Gannon ladies and gentlemen use a a candidate for a secretary of agriculture here in the Hawkeye State uh let's talk a little bit of a we introduced you as a farmer\nYou know I I Would think that the people that would want to have a secretary of agriculture in Iowa might look quarter farmer um tell us about that part of\nYour life well it's a you know as I mentioned growing up my dad had John Deere starts I didn't grow up on the farm but ah when when he sold store he went back to farmers I helped them a little bit uh in the early to thousands but kind of took a a non traditional route or helping him now being involved now I I was working in\nDC for ... USDA had just started a new job\nThe risk management agency or in January twenty Fifteen and a cousin of mine who was farm in with him died very unexpectedly and so\nI was not a position to come back right then uh but knew at that point in time I knew that that's what I wanted to do was come home and be the next generation\nOr to farm on a ... farm has been our family since Eighteen eighty eight so I can remember the the ... century farm ceremony and a twenty third tier twenty fourteen are up there on the stage with my dad one of the proudest days of his life\nAnd what kind of farming that just corn and being asked are used to have cattle way before I was involved but a ... a lot of work it is a and so we're just just corn and beans just went in and tell us what county Jasper County got outside mango\nOr we're with Jim Gannon ladies and gentlemen democratic candidate for secretary of agriculture what are you hearing Tim out there on the campaign trail you've got Ninety nine counties to govern I bet you've been\nTo all the not not all of them quite yet but we're hoping we're hoping to build the color and the rest of the matter a few more days last\nThirteen Thirteen Days ago so the more if you weren't chance to get around and talk to folks so what are the same I mean there's there's a lot of concern a you when you look at when you just look at the demographics or Iowa grew by about Ninety thousand people between twenty ten and twenty sixteen\nBut we lost population in Seventy one of our Ninety nine counties and so if if we don't have a strong advocate of me that that makes it even tougher on those rural county so we've got to do all we can to get profitability back into agriculture especially the young people know that there's a future there that's not just\nA trying to mask thousands and thousands of acres the forum on a really thin margin a and I think that I think that people are are rightly concerned with what they've seen\nA from Washington DC policies favor oil refiners over farmers are you talked to bankers they're very nervous about whether they're all their customers are gonna be able to get back in the field next spring\nI talked to a county supervisors and in a city council folks in small towns and they're nervous that farmers aren't spending money in town and and turning that local economy that things are going to get a even tougher than they already talked to\nA folks involved in health care in small towns in in rural rural places and uh you know you hear about the the doctors and dentists you haven't been a compensated for the care they provided to medicate patients they're not taking new Medicaid patients which means as medicate patients have to travel even further or for services I talked to folks\nWho people will tell you about a small town hospitals that no longer offer a OBGYNs services and so they've got to you know pregnant women have to go even farther a for to deliver a baby and you know just a couple of days ago Iowa falls which grown up and bingo I didn't think of Iowa falls a small town\nUh but the hospital there you know announced the and sometime November they'll no longer be delivering babies and so ... if you've got these small towns in rural communities\nAnd and ladies and gentleman who's a democratic candidate for secretary of agriculture we will have links to his page up on our radio blog thanks so much to him for doing the ... glad to once again that was secretary of agriculture candidate for Iowa Tim Ghana\nIf you want more information about to him and his answers for Iowa we've got links to his website up on our radio blog for all the crew that puts this together each day chap Ramsey is our production coordinator Aaron Libby Brazil's in marketing hunter ... is the voice of the business news hour and the music you're hearing right now is created exclusively worse\nBy James good luck to roll those folks and for our guest Tim Gannon my name's Michael ... be safety well be careful and most will be good your fellow man good day\n[noise] voice of eastern Iowa\nTalk to the forty one or losing your\nYour ears for Pittsburgh ...

that through about three hundred newspapers and magazines around the world with titles like computer world peace in the world Mac world et cetera and I we have about for him to the website says made in support those magazine brands and\nThat pat is one of the greatest examples of setting first when people told them it could be done and we've heard from other guest on legends of success\nHow many ... when someone had a new idea and patch us reference if you have a new idea of people telling you can't be done you're probably on the right trail to success because no one's done it on my right now\nI'm going going back one of the first you were told you couldn't go to MIT you you you want a full scholarship there while you were there a you became the editor of computers in automation magazine correct\nThat's correct and and that really gave me a chance to get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product fighters so\nI learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um now that with the big held a because they knew my name in the in my writings and analysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up um to set up a good sense of where the computers were and what the customers\nWho are using them wanted for future products and services\nAbsolutely yeah and that was a job you got while you're at MIT but you stayed with it when you graduated correct\nUm tried when as an editor I was out talking to\nThe heads of the computer companies are never them or you know told me that they had a need for this or um and then when I was surprised that that was\nToo low I should charge more that'd be taken seriously I Love that business idea and uh so I put out the proposal and wound up having a nine companies send me check for twenty five thousand dollars each perhaps payment so that was actually on the capital that are used to get started\nThe proposal and wound up having a nine company to send me check for twenty five thousand dollars each perhaps payments so that is actually all the capital that are used to get started so\nI have two or anyone asked me about how to start a business I said just talk to people who can be customers find out through unfulfilled needs and proposed to fill those needs and in many cases they'll they'll sponsor you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help people get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are in close touch with their customers they'll they'll be happy to support you\nWell absolutely I mean you know there's there's a real important in a do lessons here while you're working for that magazine of folks again it was called computers none of the nation back you know many years the number of years ago or sixties\nYeah it was a ... there and that's about\nUh sixty three three sixty three ... and ... was his job is to go all over the country as you said and gather information and we're all the computers were number this was back in the sixties he built up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource of words that were all located now so the last thing I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you that you brought this idea back for a plan new publication and you brought it back to the\nPublisher what did they tell you\nWell they said oh that's a market research project that's not something we are interested in and you know you can do it on your own\nUh so I said fine I'll Try it and then that was what started the business and\nNow that we've had a number of cases like that um [noise] after doing the talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computer centers they said they needed um a weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers what were their problems and difficulties and so we launched the weekly newspaper and everyone\nTold us it couldn't be done we're only putting fifty thousand dollars into the project all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to find a weekly newspaper\nAnd you'll be out of business in two months and you know we'll\nEither if you did well will pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you went all the one that was a bad market and we'll save some money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got very little advertising because we were new but they've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so that was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription\nAdvances we're getting from readers enthusiastic about our content\nThat's pretty amazing in ... when you go back to the original original um when when that publishers told you originally pat now you could do that we're not interested or telescopes hum how much money was raised in how you raise it to launch that new magazine and that new venture\nAdventure well uh I'm I've I've put in I called my card and put it in a five thousand dollars that was all my proceeds available and then I went to my sister and I went to the\nFirst person either employed to sort of virus or general manager and said would you be willing to invest in support me in this project and they said well you know we know you and like you and everything but um we know these things they ... they don't always succeed so\nWe're going to give you ten dollars while paper or a cat here fake adventure year capital availability\nSo your seed capital was five thousand and twenty dollars by selling your car and getting a ten dollar bills from your wife and I mean\nYou're you're my sister and a manager so I'm Sorry your yeah your sister's management right so so that was in Nineteen sixty three sixty\nFour okay and and those to investors I got to recapture says to investors it gave me the ten dollars what what's the ten dollars worth of\nAbout three and a half million dollars for the F today [laughter]\nAbsolutely unbelievable absolutely amazed and they told you couldn't be done\nA ride which always encouraged me because uh uh you know if it was easily able to be done a lot of people would have already done it so when they say can be done that means I'm going to have very much reduced competition and to\nTo buy energetically keeping in touch with um the customers and prospects you often find ways\nThat they would like to say that service provider that no one else to suggest that and then you can charge in and [noise] you know put a give them something they really want and they'll enthusiastically support it\nIs that is going to ask is eager to success but when ... when you're growing business no matter what stage it is or isn't that one of the uh the ones that critical elements that you use and success is always stay customer focused and listening to them and listening to what they need some simple but so many people don't do it\nYou're right and when people ask me oh what does it take to be an entrepreneur I say when you have to find something you want to do you're passionate about the same people alive at physical energy 'cause it would have to but Seventeen Eighteen hour days and in the early days\nYou know you have to keep your optimism eyes so you feel you're good positive experience for don't spend too much time sitting now making a paper plans because uh [noise]\nUh but you should not do is work here plan which has to do is working to market going out and finding out what people one of their changing needs and keeping you know right up to date with their changing needs and you'll be winning all the time if you try to [noise] you know go ahead and roll out a plan that you made up some time you're almost sure to be way off the market within a year or two\nThat's incredible I'm Glad you said that is very very intriguing because I find that a lot of the greatest entrepreneur is an American the wealthiest most successful never really had a formal written business plan and if they did they usually sold out\nI found that to be very helpful because you listen better if you don't have a lot of preconceived ideas and your mind\nI Love it I Love it now now when you're blowing from er from a regional business you know start off you mentioned some of the critical element I Would have been growing for regional to national what are those next critical steps gorilla business even further\nWell of course you know you have to make sure that your communication network has spread throughout the country and so people in all parts of the country are aware of your projects and then of course the next step is to begin to move into other countries and are there the the key step is to go over and you know I'm ... and actually make discussions with have proposed customers to make sure they\nSee the same needs and then go out and find someone in that country who\nShares your passion for the filming those needs and has the enthusiasm that charisma to be able to hire and motivate good people and then you know given the resources they want to give them an could encourage them in and support get out of their way let them you know just to their local market and\nTo provide them you know help and assistance but not try to tell them how to do it because you're never going to fully understand a foreign market where the local person who lives in the culture every day is\nGoing to be much more able to move quickly adjusted his changes within that markets\nYou know another point you came up with that you shared with me

dying or look Ninety five years old because they've smoke they drank they never went for physicals they never saw the doctor whereas he was on a regular basis once a year and he didn't just accept what he was told there would be active discussions\nHe would research things afterwards and do follow up at all the rest of it\nHe's the type of patient with the right attitude he works with his position for his health and he follows the advice and he can see how beneficial that has been\nWell and they say they can my dad was my dad any like Seventy nine now\nAnd he he rides just the four

fix anything\nAnd are still very very active and like that and he's also still the go to guy for everybody else no one has ever believe that retirement was in the cards for him so they're all kind of

years at a ... type of\nLiterature at one\nTime and we've got to write a book and I didn't really know what are we going to be about the toys came to me one moment labeled the ... one of the future I kept writing thought actually doing became we just because\nYou're writing to play behind that door stuff\nYou know I I think it's really neat and the front of the book actually has this is visual laws as three doorways and the middle one is lit up so what does that representing for unless I Know but I Want to hear from you why is the middle door let up\nWhere you find that we all share\nBack\nLike based on what we do what we have a piece that but we only want to replace it with a passion for the future and what you thought\nThe very moment because I thought you could go back [laughter] linear kind if you will do it you know where your thoughts are and in order to do what you are your thoughts\nYour time if you will so important to know where are your thoughts are and in order to do what your thoughts are you going to have you thought\nEdited active voucher station that separates you're aware from your thought you know I like to find a country that we all tried to get the bike share that why you have to like coming out of the president\nYou know I read something recently and I and then I it really kind of opened up my own consciousness\nAnd it wasn't how many hours a day we generally are thinking about the day before and I thought why that is just so true that is you're paying attention you know okay how how many times in my reflected back to yesterday\nAnd the more I thought about that the more I could be present because I can realize I'm I'm aren't really thinking about something yesterday or maybe I'm worried about something tomorrow um but just that actor\nKnowing that in then taking steps to to be in the press and be in that middle room I mean a a really big difference to me\nWhat you ate is right on the habit to leave knowing or being aware that you're thinking of something from yesterday\nI asked him what we we have something like Seventy thousand dollars a day and I think along the lines of Ninety percent starch are\nBarred from yesterday or your electric car looking back and then we're projecting to the future to worry about the future but not not going back into the room we're not going to the future room about being aware that you're that\nMen have the same thought every six seconds [laughter]\nSo that's the only one that comes to use the same as the every six seconds yesterday was my minimize those thoughts\nI warn you can clear out some of those [laughter] it'd be much more efficient [laughter] [laughter] that is true you those you're speaking the truth [laughter] most\nPeople realize what room there and I mean do you do most people realize or they have to read a book like the three rooms or listen to a show like this to actually say oh wow maybe I'm In the other room\n[noise] but it's actually really ... based on how you feel like we have today and China monitor start all the time\nEspecially like every second that keeps popping up so we were able to monitor all those dog number one and makes it a lot easier to kind of put it in three different bucket for three different you know the future but how you know which from your play based on how you deal\nBecause when I talk about the Castro talking about recalling positive task experience that makes you feel good about\nIt about that how can that negative emotion in you relive those negative emotion it could be something that I co workers don't matter to him or something you can do and\nYou know when You're Joking about it or something you did you feel guilty about it and you know the negative emotions are eating you up\nYou're constantly going back and stealing those negative emotions or in the future robots looking ahead to the future thinking about what you're going in and worrying about how you got to get something to worry about a joy stressing and\nDo we got a call to negative emotions you know people they don't realize that the key is what you said you need to be aware of unit actively monitor how you feel that let you know it really\nWell and there's been so many studies we were talking about this before you came on so many studies that show that attitude is a direct reflection of your house in your health is a direct reflection of your attitude\nAnd I think it was Henry Ford that said you you can think you can or think you can't but either way you're right\nAnd this is the same concept when it comes to a gene and help you you can take years thinking you're old you will be if you're signed into the idea that you're young and you still have life and you you will be but we got to go to a break I Want to make sure you tell us on Twitter at a young media that the young media we'll be right back and we're going to talk\nTo a little bit more about these three rooms with our special guest Kevin Murphy\nDo show and

done and you're working backwards and the actual [laughter]\nYeah they use mirror linguistics and that's part of a girl linguistics you know put the pathways they're so than the actual can follow\nOkay I'm going to use your things I learned in your book this rerun them I'm going to apply them to how patients can use them for longevity and I want to see if you think I got it right okay\nAll right so here's what I think we have a patient come in and do you just giving them new uh maybe it's a new diet or a new a lifestyle that they need to do because maybe they are pre diabetic will just say their pre diabetic\nMay have three choices when they leave may can spend time in the past grim and they could be you know it's sad that they did all these things that have gotten them to that point\nAnd and maybe even lose sight of what they can be doing now to prevent the diabetes or they can live in the middle room to room the you bet you say we got to live and the ... around and say what can I Do right now to better my house what choices can I make or they live in the future room\nWhich could at times be good because they need to legalize themselves being healthy or\nMake it instead be living in the future him in a bad way saying I'm going to start next week I'm going to start doing this later because I'm not going to do it right now but I'll I'll maybe start maybe on New Years so it was just a a good application to to what you're trying to teach us\nPretty accurate I Would that would be a little bit worse not what it never going to work or not going to get the money\nWe can get a worst case scenario and that's really struck again in so much thinking what it'd be better in the future is ready\nTo order like\nWhat what do you like that\nAnd how would it be [noise] the what would you like have already accomplished that already be healthy\nYeah when you want to be healthy whether you want or need extra help or you want to get your blood pressure down whatever that is from a health perspective ready healthy\nBecause you know that we're hearing about\nIt a couple of the time and what we've got a power greater than back in your body right at the

William Shatner Captain Kirk mask\nKid out time Syria Syria I'm just\nRemembering it now they they play with the hair and they open up the pilots we're hearing more but it it was not hurt mass from the Nineteen seventies yes wow and learn something new every child is now in the later movies they changed the masking didn't use it as much all the time the original movie it's the uh that's the mask\nSomehow very apropos there you go there's no reference to Star Trek how about this one this goes back\nThe mask somehow very apropos\nThere you go there's no reference to Star Trek how about this one this goes back a little bit to sixty Nineteen sixty and uh before I tell you what it is and so forth I listen to the seat this gives you an idea [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nA man to remember that one oh sure psycho psycho is pretty good it is it's very scary um\nAnd that that that became part of like the vernacular growing up I mean it was that movie predates us but\nYou know when you were you were you are mimicking going after someone holding your arm up in the air with a with a fake an air knife right and and making the stabbing motion you would always go to the ... I was playing in the movie became iconic for the shower scene where our Shannon Lee\nWho is a huge star the time was murdered in the shower now what reference do you have ... chat do we know the reference yeah between Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis\nWith her daughter yeah how 'bout that James Mattis was Janet leaves a daughter and the two\nOf them are into the most iconic horror movies of all time ... pretty pretty interesting I did that besides that there was also another Hitchcock movie that scared the heck out of me when I saw it as a first as a as a kid on television or the birds\nAre just don't go around attacking people without no reason you know what I mean I think we're in real trouble I don't know how they started a wife and I know is here with the cradle ignore\nA lot of all Mr bird will\nBack [noise]\nSo ... what'd you think of the birds we saw that one guy was great to I mean I was a kid and and uh the scene where the the explosion that the gas station had a and just the the the phone booth when the birds like breaking the glass and the phone booth\nUm and the the two school house with the kids running and getting attacked by the bird was I remember it because it was so weird it was so out of left field\nThe that the birds would turn on humans or it was just it just kind of shook you you\nKnow and it was all on believable like birds who care even if a ... they looked real and then yeah and it became\nTons of birds yes and then they pay you know they they hold themselves up in this house\nAnd it just was so of course how British guy was so incredibly well directed again two of them hit us going and I think all horror movies should aspire to do with Hitchcock did again he took the time to build these characters up and dispense little it's almost like going up that roller coaster you kids start\nAt the stop the top of a rollercoaster and go down right it's got to go up in ... it it gives you you get a clicking and as you are going up the rollercoaster it gives you that anticipation which is almost more of the fear factor than being at the apex and going down right\nOr so and that's what these movies ought to me that's what ... was also a great roller coaster ride and ah so you know I think those are the epitome also here's one that I Know is one of the ... of every\nMan named Charles ... who am I told him in the same line I'm planning on individual\nAt some point during the winter must have suffered some kind of\nMy [noise]\nAnd that's not going to happen with\nMe [laughter] distinctly what'd you remember on that money\nOr the shining was a great also very spooky movie I Know Stephen King wasn't thrilled about the film adaptation of his book the same name but ah I remember seeing it in the theater also that there was old enough to see when it first came out and also just just creep me out\nAnd I think he didn't like some of that because what went on in the book was not entirely what went on on the screen and some of what went on the book was in people's minds and all you just they didn't have the exposition to explain really what caused all\nThis yeah it was only what you were talking about before where the book probably was more into the character development whereas the movie\nYou went there a little bit but probably not as much as he would have liked to to um it just kind of cut to the chase right like the book started well before the hotel was like the very the the back part of the book right there was a whole story about him a ... in the beginning of the book in the movie just sort of alludes to it really\nThat you know and his pressure in his life that it's going through and also a it's a help explain some of what white took this job and All right side is that what went on previously and what was the denial of demonic possession if you will of the house\nWhich which they didn't really get into too right in the movie right so uh but again the movie itself I think that a great job you know creep in the\nEnd of the flashes here and there in the movie of all the stuff at past what went on in the past and the right place but she didn't catch it really fast you need in divinity at it right you know or was it was a lot of history to that location here's one that uh\nI don't know a lot of people like I it's it's okay it's more or less the slasher but I think the idea of going to sleep and and being attacked in his sleep is horrifying and\nKids with St Louis is coming to get\nYour news [noise]\n[noise] nice\nHills [laughter]\nCare you know what's this what's with\nThe Boogie Man at the second reference Halloween had one as well to the Boogie Man they should make a horror movie called the Boogie Man I'll probably did maybe I mean like everyone's talking about the I guess what you've got to be a little kid of course that's yeah the the horrifying being in your sleep or under the bed right\nI'm going to bring the closet yep yeah man's in the closet\nAnd by the way if you watch the uh ... well there was a closet scene in Halloween the new one I'm not giving away does a ... Halloween as a closet seeing there as well I don't want to know that it's going to be part of the roller coaster ride on the one you want to mention the a different movie would\nWell we were talking about movies I personally have cracked me out spook me a big one was the Blair Witch project the original one back in a row nine Ninety nine or ...\nYes we will your the radio version and he said it was always translates well well you you get several cats that you know you turn on San Pedro el will hit a like a bell and you start to seem more than we do that with you can we do this on YouTube\nAnd actually we could do it now on YouTube yes in the ... that we have to All right well that's a good you know to keep that piece of paper you have another one\nUh I Do now I Can't say I've seen this one but just reading the the description it's called the creeping terror from Nineteen sixty four just to give you the background on it that they\nLost all of the audio they shot the movie and apparently somehow they lost all the audio so all they had was a visual film\nAnd they didn't have enough money to apparently like hire the actors back in ... job over the the film so they just had some people do it in post production and not only that it doesn't sink up necessarily to the what you're seeing\nSo it's just as bad over to above the voices not totally ... and and it sounds like you're the monster you were just describing it's like this guy is a Chinese dragon but it's a person\nAnd walking around in what looks like like this really dirty grimy sleeping bag and that's that's the monster and I'm Jeff ... it's on a lot of list says like the worst horror movie of all time they're creeping terror and look forward in a Netflix or something like that\nThat will be one of those ones where you go through with it would be Netflix or any of the pay services and and you know hey if the rent certain movies will direct T. them you know and that will be the ones for free\nYou know you raise ... who pay will give you a five dollar credit on your account of unions watch that [laughter] that sounds like what's up tiger lowly remember that one was with a Woody Allen that was the original mystery science fair three thousand ... he created that whole idea\nYeah pretty much what he did was he put he put his own dialogue as they did here into an existing movie\nBut more to to market it as I was a star and it was so fun it was really good ah but ... digress yeah how about a little psi phi horror movie sure it's horrendous okay\nIt mixes friday the thirteenth which I don't think any of them are any good but to begin with them and the other end friday the thirteenth Jason X. Jason X. they froze\nThe body of Jason and somehow we ended up on a space craft ... going somewhere well that can happen course and they saw him out and the hilarity ensues on the ship\nOr they saw him out on the ship yeah he's now some of the he was accompanied they sent them on a spaceship without people with a crew yes and on his house just to make just to ah basically create the premise of the movie that's why they did it\nAnd the astronauts two of them were young ladies and they wear in outer space half shirts so they shut belly shirts so you can see the picture so I mean it it's ... it's so bad like just\nIt looks ... it it says it's from two thousand one but these women look like they're wearing outfits from like a sick the sixties go go movie\nYeah they they clearly were made just ... to to the mood let's be able to use different outfits have attractive\nWomen or be hunted by Jason I mean wow really really bad is yeah I don't have any others or not I have one that's a really good one that I that was raided bad I think you should say oh that's interesting that's a that's Denzel Washington and John Goodman in a movie from Nineteen Ninety eight cold\n... the fall and where there's a demonic presence is in inside of Syria serial killer serial killer just before he dies the electric chair touches a prison guard and his essence goes to prison guard anytime and and then he kills and any time that someone has touched by this person has ... corporate with the essence of this\nDemon uh it becomes the deem it takes over your body and Denzel Washington John Goodman are of the cops trying to solve these murders a string of murders off and he finds out this and it it's it's a great idea I thought it was done really really really well I mean I just the fact that\nBoth of them John Goodman and Denzel would agree to be in this movie to me says it's probably pretty good movie yeah I Would definitely check it out if you say it's been on lists of of the worst horror movies of all now is\nI Know it's just a a rotten tomatoes given like forty two so I don't I don't know why I thought it was really done to check that one of those ones sometimes I don't know if people are the reviews are right about ... check it out in the fall and every other list thirty seconds here\nOr there was a I remember there's a really bad ... a\nRemake of Halloween speaking of Halloween Halloween three seasonal which I'm which you know right off the bat there is no which in it [laughter] I don't I never really got it you're waiting ... during the movie okay where's the which\nNow there is No Child that's great and there's no ah of Mike Myers and there's no Jamie Lee Curtis\nExactly to use the company that makes ...
