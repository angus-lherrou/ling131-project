private insurance and basically turn us into one ... right\nExactly exactly and you know the fact is Senator McCaskill has voted already to cut that seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of

talk with David Harris director of athletics at you and I had about four thirty five today and then in the five o'clock hour a lot of un I sports to get to some some you and I put both talk\nA just a ton of things that a piece bracket Tyler gee Craig Haley's brackets allergy out per se us with both the latest Missouri Valley put both conference power rankings\nUm and you know I'm sure I'm sure I'm hoping they stick with it because I think this this formula for the most part did its job this year but\nYou know there were a few issues going into the first round of the playoffs last week um but you know now we're into the quarter finals the teams are where they are and you know at this point it's a a ... kind of moved to maybe a look back at what all happened but uh you know hey a quarter finals are coming up this Friday and ah you know it's exciting time of year\nYeah it really is no doubt about it by the way they are there are six classes of football in the state of Iowa some I sometimes I I don't know why I I I forget about that age pull your game but the\nSix classes with the class a one eight to eight three eight florrie and then the eighth player games or don't want to short anybody there um it looked like the RPI thing\nWorked really good in the big school class for a pretty good in three eight in to weigh\nA and an eight and an eight man some southern in two teams were left out I gotta believe maybe those teams not\nOverly crazy about the RPI system that left them out\nNo maybe not and and I'm sure the teams are probably referring to into a at least or you know clear lake in Columbus Catholic or to seven and two teams to really really good teams I'm at that I Know that and our Des Moines register high school football rankings we had clear like rank six to eight at the end of the year I'm you know we're really high on then they have some really good players\nUm but you know hey I did that you know one of the rules um that came with the RPI I Know I said this earlier but that is you know if you went in your district you get in that was one of the automatic qualifiers to get into the postseason and and in the case of class to a um there were a couple of district ties I Know that there was one district that had a three way tie and that was with union port city\nI'm Ben ten in West marshal on them because they all tied they all got in and so that took away potential wild card spots and then there was another district where a a green county and Carol Kemper they tied but because Carole Kemper one that had had they got that automatic dead and\nAnd green county qualified as an at large so that that took away another wildcard spot in class to way and and there were a couple of other district chance like west liberty in Williamsburg just finished below clear lake in the uh in the final RPI standing because they want their district they got to\nYou know take that spot away from them so to speak so you know maybe that's one of the things that the association looks at tweaking I'm not exactly sure how you might fix that moving forward but you know yeah I mean there there were a handful of teams in some of those smaller classes that got left out and\nAnd you know sometimes it just kind of is what it is I mean it stinks 'cause you want the best sixteen teams but I think by and large you know if you do when your district you should get in and for the most part I I think the association did a good job this year\nClass for a had a huge upset in the opening round a tell us about that\nYeah that was a little wild wasn't it a lot of people were kind of you know rolling their eyes are scarf and it's out these old getting him with a foreword five record but er but I'll tell you what mandate their opponent's record uh overall record of fifty four and twenty seven it's good for a sixty seven percentage winning percentage\nAnd that was the best in class for a so I mean those five ... five playoff teams for southeast poking and then you know it kinda served as a little bit of validation almost for the RPI when you know very first year in existence the sixteenth takes off of one um you know they they play really good defensive game they were kind of keep in centennial is a run off ants in check and they were\nKind of taking advantage of opportunistic off and they were able to kind of scorn us to a you know put away the jaguars so the team that's been the dome to straight years and this year they get bumped off in the first round so heck of a game or from the rams to start off and you know kind of a heck of a way for this RPI postseason to kick off in his first year\nAnything else in for a that jumped out at you\n[noise] I you know there wasn't as maybe too much I thought ah you know some of the results um maybe weren't surprising in the result themselves with maybe in the way they came down now you know I thought you know Dowling forty one zero went over Fort Dodge was pretty emphatic\nUm you know I figure Dowling would probably win that game but to win at forty one zero in shut out that ah\nThat explosive ... that was pretty impressive on valley kind of had the muscle out of went over ANC any in the first round um you know I kind of thought that was an impressive showing from Anthony I'm\nYou know outside of that I mean not too much I mean walkie rolled Cedar Falls role Johnston rolls I was the west in Bettendorf they get a rematch in the quarter final this coming friday weren't too many surprises outside of\nA you know maybe southeast both winning\nWhat about in three what surprised you in three and a big upset that took place their ... who\nAre maybe not so much in the way up sets\nUm but I Will I mean you I mean you can maybe point to a western Dubuque\nPicking off soul and in the first round 'cause that was that was a pretty lopsided when for a for western to be um you know it's only came in undefeated western you got a couple of losses are but you know there are two losses or to a a north Scott and ... and ah a cigarette to Dave your yeah um so you know you know those weren't too ... too bad losses by any means and\nUm you know soul and maybe hadn't played the tough this schedule coming in and you know I mean it's pretty emphatic the way western to be be stolen but you know maybe not terribly surprising um but you know I mean outside of that I mean ... ... you know that that she might actually be\nBe beat a bowl or at least tell them maybe put forth a blueprint without a hang with them for four quarters um but you know three I mean it kind of when exactly how we all thought it might ah you know the quarterfinals of setting up to be really really fun I mean there's going to be a fun tournament all the way through em and this Friday is especially going to be a lot of fun\nAnd tell us the kind of some of the key matchups that we should watch for on friday night in round two\n[noise] yeah so I and you know in ... I think for you guys you know Cedar Falls walkie that one's really intriguing 'cause you see her falls has that really ... bad mean defense led by jak Campbell um they have arguably the most exciting player in the state out all fence Logan Wolfe um you know but they are going up against a walkie team that prides itself on speed\nUm you know Mitch Randall quarterback for the warriors or he can kind of make any throw you want um you know this is an explosive offense they've really kind of found their footing the last few weeks um they rolled through district play after losing two non district matchups a valley in dialing\nUm so you know I think Cedar Falls going to have their hands full I think all really all the ... for a quarter final match ups are going to be a lot of fun with valley dialing west that north and then uh south east pulled Johnston\nThree I'm really intrigued by a western north Scott I think that when you know that that that one got the potential to be a postseason classic so to speak I mean those are two really really good teams\nAre kind of interesting to see who wins that one because the winner of that one should maybe get a surgeon blood looting um when you get to the dome it followed the top seeds end up sneaking through a two way\nA lot to interesting ones here I like the ... going to walk on match up by you'd just because I really don't know who's going to win that one I mean if you based off the RPI rankings that's a third ranked while Congress ... ranked I'll go to a two teams that are wildly talented walk on obviously got to say title game last year\nThat will be a lot of fun not PC embers Williamsburg a final undefeated team in P. C. M. Williamsburg returning stay chance that want to be a lot of fun\nOr a steak finalists excuse me a you know go keep going down through one and I like the south central Calhoun west to match up that one looks like it's going to be a lot of fun or some such Calhoun has a mean defense west who's got a mean offsets which one's going to give\nA you know class say I'm Hudson versus ...\nThat one looks like it's going to be a lot of fun stuff that Chicago who has a mean defense west who's got a mean often so which one's going to give\nA you know class say I'm Hudson versus highland riverside that's been kind of been that team and class say all year undefeated a tenant going into this match up the highland riverside or\nAre they kind of surprised that people I think well by just by sneaking into the playoffs by going seven to two and then they were able to really shocks them people by picking up a really good Duran team fourteen to Thirteen last week\nA that match it looks like all sorts of exciting and then a a player can forget about a player I like they are rocks for Don Bosco matchup Rockford are only regular season last I Believe was to Don Bosco\nI'm you know and they picked off a really good turkey valley team last week and now they get the the two time defending state champs in the quarterfinals winter goes to the DOMA it'd be interesting to see who wins that one\nYeah and and it's interesting as as we look at those playoff brackets who's still alive it's just it's just amazing that we're not talking about I was city Regina trying to win another sneak titled a team that this year ... was was eliminated before they can even get into the playoffs\nYeah that was yeah that's kind of a it's a good point 'cause you know you'll do you think of you know class to a class one day football for the last you know almost a decade and it's been iris city Regina at the top you know almost every year you know when they were winning if they were in the title getting the last two years so\nYeah definitely kind of you know programs go through ups and downs ebbs and flows and this was just kind of one of those years where\nA couple of things needed to go right I'm at the end of the year for Regina it again and and uh you know they ran into a really really good like Newark for team who's\nWho's still alive they're playing a they're playing this week at a interstate thirty five and a class once a quarter final so you know that you know ... sometimes sometimes that happens but I agree that you know a little weird not seeing Regina in the playoff let alone in the quarterfinals\nAnother interesting no ... seems like al ... got a football town because you know I don't is still in the playoffs in to a and then bishop gear again still alive but what about those two teams\nYeah man those are I mean those have been some fun seems to watch I mean we kind of mentioned outgoing other matchup against walk on this coming Saturday or this coming friday excuse me uh eight and one uh they\nReally I mean they ain't no before they lost in the regular season finale and then they beat a really good scrappy trustworthy team last week\nOr two in advance and then bishop arrogant I mean that the team that's been to the dome that's been to the title game uh took care of the ... valley a team last week and now they get Edward ... who's a you know they'd be nuts some are that are beating up some pretty good team this year especially in BGN last week so I mean it's not like these teams are\nYou know no no easy games when you get to this point in the season but definitely I don't know that that's a football town this year it'd be really cool to see both of those teams get to the don't\nGo to a good one at a excellent sports writer with the Des Moines register runner Billie Jean VIP\nHotline he's all over the high ... high school football playoffs all six classes teams all across the states\nInteresting and not only a new system to put teams into the playoffs Cody but uh don't they received this thing after the they get the floor team to the semi final so you don't you don't really know if you win this next round game exactly who you're going to play until the receipt it right\n\nNews I'm Richard Denison President Trump is in Pittsburgh where he is the first lady visited the synagogue were eleven people were gunned down during services last Saturday\n\nReview the makeshift memorial to the victims outside the synagogue with plans to visit victims injured in the shooting lawmakers are reacting to President Trump's announcement that he will issue an executive order to an automatic citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan telling W.

S C I run in Peoria, Illinois\nAh what else did we have there seemed like there was something else that took place on the sports front over the weekend what am I missing David\nWell we did have a exhibition a bath basketball alone on Sunday as well\nThere you go just I just your thoughts on this past week's athletic events for you and I paint their athletics\nWell I'll start by saying that uh I'm tremendously proud of our soccer program and the stuff that they continue to take\nA and the work that our seniors have done to be able to help us have a foundation that will continue to build on with coach Eric some think is appropriate anytime that you have one of your sports\nSeason come to a conclusion that you express thanks and appreciation for the work that those student athletes did a and the returning student athletes will continue to do a lot of people don't know but as soon as the season is over with preparations for the next year\nBegan in earnest so really just want to uh think coach Eric and his staff are seniors an entire team for the work that they did and giving us a back to the Missouri Valley conference tournament and putting us in a position to be able to host a home game and that tournament that didn't turn out the way that we wanted\nIt went through both overtime came down a penalty kick so\nIt's a tough way to lose but obviously our team was willing to fight down to the very end as far as abreast of what's happened I think if you work in athletics\nThis is you just the way things go there some weeks where you're going to have a everything go your way and all of your teams win and there's nothing but good news and then there's some weeks but you don't want to come into work because it seems like everything that could go wrong uh\nDoes go wrong in but then most of the time what you're going to have happened as a mixture\nYou're going to have weeks where some of your team's women some of your teams don't and that was a case this last week where you have a sport like volleyball which continues on the two big ones at home\nAnd they put themselves in a position to continue to be in first place in the conference and being a you have sports like soccer where you take a loss or football or where you take a loss on the road and so uh it's just the natural ebb and flow of working in athletics\nOr you want to be able to put those things behind you learn from um uh but uh there's always enough to make the next week and uh to be able to improve on what it is that you've done so a\nReally it's about for us looking for it you kind of well alone things or maybe twenty four hours afterwards just like the coaches till the players to do and then after that it's about how do we move forward how do we try to make sure that we have a good crowd for any home events that we have the upcoming week and I don't we make sure that we can\nPin you to to keep our fans understanding the important role to play and that we continue to support our team\nAnd and that's where I wanted to go to ... you know how important college football is it pretty much any you'd university across the country that has football in the Panthers get that huge home when\nUh a couple of weeks ago against South Dakota said everybody on cloud nine and then a heartbreaking top rolled last last week kind of brought everybody down a little bit but now\nThe panther still have playoff aspirations can still get to where they want to be at the end of the season and postseason football but you got a huge home football game this Saturday at one against the uh top fifteenth rank team that they're in the same boat as you and I think if they want to get the postseason foot by we\nI Know it was a disappointing loss for paint their nation on the football side of it on Saturday but\nWhat you need everybody there this Saturday to jump back in get on board and support this football team because they can still get to postseason football and and make them Ron\nRight and you you asked your players they have a short memory and in many ways you as your fans to be able to do the same thing because as you as a as you mentioned\nWe still have um some of radicals in front of us are certainly as far as making post season play and what you're into the playoffs\nThen anything can happen depending on who's ... who's playing well who's healthy who's playing at home all of those things come into play\nAnd so we can't afford to have players who are ... mistakes that were made last weekend and you certainly don't want to have your fan base dwelling on the disappointment that came from that being able to win that game because there's another huge game to play this weekend against the quality opponent two teams that are going to have a lot of urgency or\nTo be able to go out and get a win so uh I Would expect this to be a heck of a of a game or that's going to be closely contested it gets to quality teams\nAnd the one advantage that we have is that this game is played the dome and when we looked at the beginning of the year\nWe saw that a number of our big games this year we had the advantage of being able to play them at home North Dakota said South Dakota state and looking at a game like Illinois state as well as Missouri state and so we felt like we were going to have an advantage in those games from the same point of being able to be at home\nAnd have our home fans be able to come out and he'll share sold the victory and they were phenomenal or in the way that they helped us against South Dakota state uh we're still not at the point where I Would like us to be as far as that they sell out\nBut uh we had a much better crowd than we have against North Dakota state and so I'd like to see us build on that but to be offended weekend this weekend Illinois state coming in all the things that are on the table the things that are skilled in front of us\nAre the op too late that we have a and really just the fact that these are our kids right these are our science that leads a and if we're not supporting that at who's going to support them\nAre so many times as easy to make your decision based on that we when we did we lose that last game\nIs easy to make your decision on what's the weather going to be like or whether or not you're going to be able to tailgate or um whether or not you want to pay five dollars to park or all of those other things but when it comes down to what this really\nThat you're going to be able to tailgate or um whether or not you want to pay five dollars to park or all of those other things but when it comes down to what this really all about\nThese are our kids going out and given their heart you know playing their guts out every time they step out on the field and I would love to see all of us rally around about ...\nWhat it is that they're trying to cheat not just for themselves for their team but for all of us because they represent all of us every time they go out there\nAre and so if we can show them that we know what not to stand with our presence\nI as I've said many times on social media support your Panthers with your presents are being at the game being in the stands are no matter what the weather is outside we know what's going to be absolutely perfect and tell us so it's a great situation for us to have disability\nAnd he's a great opportunity to make sure that our kids understand just how much are we love and appreciate them they want them to succeed\nCollie five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by

C.

team out of the south wonder a team out of the Ohio Valley happens instead of playing some of the better big sky conference teams like they have in recent years a in a\nIs that players how could you

everybody cat scratching their head asking you know why\nWhy it was such a lackadaisical lays it ... it wasn't a lackadaisical effort but just\nAs just it just wasn't good yeah [noise]\nAh it it was it was a struggle yeah and and and right out of the gate I mean the first couple of good often see possessions in fact coach both like yesterday at the press conference was asked you know did a lot of the gain momentum swing early on in this game even in that first quarter when\nTo red zone scoring opportunities for you when I in the first quarter and you came away with just three points\nYou know there's there's enough game left uh to to where you can overcome some of those things you come out with three points it happens I Know I'm you know office of we've been very good in the red zone and and we've taken advantage of those opportunities and [noise]\nYou know unfortunately last Saturday that didn't happen force but but we we we don't we don't\nPanic or you know defensively we understand hey you know it's our job to go out and we got we got to get the football bucks for a fence and and give me another opportunity so a lot of football a lot of football game left um you know I don't think it was how exist opportunity\nBut a missed opportunity is I think the office who coaches would would talk about that [noise] um and and our kids understand that we got to take advantage of those in defense of women don't worry about it we just go out and we play in and try to get the ball by for office\nAre also a coach ... said\nThe big place by western Illinois often mix Shane enlist short two of their stars really really hurt you an eye on Saturday\nWell some of the errors that I Know we may defensively was a you know taking proper angles maybe in\nIn our in our pursuit 'em and you're absolutely right too awfully good football players you guys that when they're in space can make a mess and ah they took advantage of that and I'm so\nYou know we we can correct those things we we've we've watched it we've we've addressed that more kids understand that um you know I'm\nYou know we're gonna play great athletes every week and I think our kids understand that and those are two of the to the better athletes in the conference and then you have to you have to to throw out to them though those guys may plays and and we didn't [noise] and\nYou know the next time we get opportunities we gotta make boys yeah\nAnd also uh I said the coach bulk like I got to believe you expect these guys your players the Panthers to bounce back big time refocus and really get after this Saturday or\nYeah or you know we've got a we've got to preserve pretty resilient group of guys um and and that's that's a credit to our kids um you know we're all disappointed with the the loss on on Saturday but uh you know we'd go to a group of seniors and uh\nUh some kids are very motivated to get better we can and week out and uh\nThey're very coach of all um when we watch the tape [noise] um which you know it was a pretty uh you know they'll learn from it and they'll try to correct it and the only way we can do that is is with the great great we practice and preparation and will ah\nWill have good we practice I think I think our kids were really really work hard to correct the years that we made and and to understand that that we got a great football team coming in here and they'll be excited and ready to play\nGoing to need it going to need it going to have to be a super focus this it feels like it's a lot on the line it's all on the line this Saturday as far as playoff possibilities for
