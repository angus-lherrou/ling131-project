curious for Ninety eight yards they still haven't got a guy to a hundred yards at this year I think are torn young kid with an at Ninety six last week and now nine to get for\nAnd I am so they're getting close but ah but overall you know if you're going back to that their their share of duties and that's how I was able to hold off or forty minutes they just are ... that they had a drive in the first quarter that one Seventeen plays\nIt took up over nine minutes at the clock and that was kind of set the tone for the whole day there was only on the field goal at the end of that but they they it was clear out that\nThey were just gonna run the ball down their throat and that's what they did\nNot exactly what I was really good at mark and then another thing that that really stood out to me was Iowa was nine for Eighteen on third down fifty percent on the day so that has to have something to do with why they had forty minutes of possession doesn't it\nRight and a couple of worked on comparisons to the early in that game so you lose the consoles or third long\nDark situation and they actually got the first time I running the ball in what typically will be passing down including one mandates then we had a really nice Thirteen you are going on thirty nine\nReally rough defense while they it it kind of had the middle open therefore I'm sure they weren't expecting him to run because usually thousand [laughter]\nAnd he did a quarterback draw that picked up Thirteen Years the longest one of his career so there's a lot of places like that when they needed them or the physical Ficre muggy our students was fantastic\nIn those conditions a career heights refills for him so special teams that their part to me it was just a perfect day for I mean I don't know what you would find the ... to ... size but I didn't have been a penalty for the first time in twelve years\nA game without a plan that they had a lot of the week for against Indiana so you know that they were talking about that so you have just so many so many good things with the debt on Saturday\nAnd another thing mark that really stands out is Iowa was dominance of the line of scrimmage I mean Maryland only Russia for sixty eight yards as a team Iowa had two hundred twenty four yards how impressive was was controlling the line of scrimmage for Iowa\nYeah and that was probably the story of the game certainly for that defense because uh Maryland is a very one heavy team the average two hundred and forty five yards rushing pregame coming into that\nThat came Saturday and now that was obviously the job one for the defense list to kind of control that you know they do a lot of really a tricky things with motion and they're moving moving Lyman around before the snap and titans and\nAre trying to get your eyes out of places that defense in Iowa was really ready for anything that threw at him and uh was in the gaps Maryland's longest one was sixteen yards maybe\nI'm sort of if they limit the explosive plays I think Maryland we had for first downs so I was just complete from beginning to end that because of the control and they were only on the field at the ... thing Maryland only around three nine plays that's lost again in the parents' era\nUh and that's really amazing to think about it [laughter] and they were barely on the field because every time I got up in Iowa you know it was kind of a negative situations or if there's a lot of third laws that they could not throw the ball at all which is not the calling card anyway so I think they looked at six passing it was just a\nThere was no mystery to that game once once once I got rolling it just kind of knew what was going to happen\n[noise] Mark Emmert sports writer with the Des Moines register on her village in the I. P. hotline yeah Kissimmee health throws at Fifteen times\nCompleted seven of them six to his guys and one to a to a hockey I got an interception but that's that's a forty seven yards passing how how tough for the plane conditions on Saturday in that game\nThey were tough I mean everybody talked about it because\nThe windows listed at twenty two miles per hour but it was gusting to forty at times and the only thing I talk to them I've ever seen that for the game was it was not coming from the same direction throughout the game I kept shifting in terms of uh where you know or Russian was coming from so he said he had a really tough time\nYour throat that game figuring out what his range would be kept talking to her parents like I think I make one from forty\nIf I have to end this certain conditions and especially the second half but when we picked up and he does every six yard that was a that was a ... just flooded in there um and that so I and I think it was all set up for the past and you know make sandwiches first attempt was kicked off other kind of four decision by him\nAnd then he said after that it got really cautious because he knew that you know the only way to lose the game was would it be to give it away will turn over ... mistakes and when that ground game was going with the defenses plan they didn't need a lot of points turns out they only get three but uh uh but so he got really conservative there too and yet the one who legally nice touchdown pass the brand Smith writes will halftime\nI'm as brings his first touchdown but other than that it was pretty much just skip a thing on the ground keep our defense on the sidelines rested and then you know we got an easy when you\nSee that there was another crazy stat coming out of that game or if I remember right on on the the number of times that number a place to Marilyn ran and I walk I territory\nYeah they got those too and the second one was the other stuff you just talked about the guys they got they got over the yard line right in one place or like yours literally ... never crossed that field again yeah just a\nCrazy dominance those I don't know if I've seen in quite like that what what I did too I think a pretty good team I mean Maryland you know their foreign three they're not they're not the worst of the Big Ten for sure and I was sort of made him look really really bad\nMark how's the Big Ten west shape and out you know Wisconsin one this week and there's some people that think Iowa Wisconsin is going to trip up one more time Iowa ... hasn't looked great where's\nEverything stand right now how to use the foresee things going\nYeah those good really fascinating because uh Purdue obviously with that when they got over how state there right in the mix now and I were still has to go there after Penn State northwestern\nWell when I almost lost tractors or but it didn't so there are also won last team in the in the ... you got four kids sitting out one last each and the other three all control their own destiny only Iowa does not Iowa needs Wisconsin to lose somewhere as he mentioned now I uh Wisconsin does have to play in Michigan yet so\nThere are certainly a potential for a lost there and Penn State so uh their their schedule is not not easy either but uh it's interesting to see I think I was\nI mean they got shot this week for sure I mean there are five and a half when underdogs but both teams are bank that's going to be a really good game and then have produced in home against north western I mean these next three weeks are going to decide the whole thing I Believe\nYou mentioned Michigan just your thoughts on that\nThat produced in home against north western I mean these next three weeks are going to decide the whole thing I Believe\nYou mentioned Michigan just your thoughts on that whole Michigan Michigan State a few that are nearly turned into a pre game brawl with Michigan State walking the link to the field into a ... Michigan players around the field just kinda walking around and and the stretching out\nYeah really regrettable and certainly that's something that can be avoided I think it sounds like a\nNow the coaches are going after each other today I saw on a teleconference some news conference they have all of us really really complaining about the Antonio's behavior and if they just look so childish um but it sounds like to me you know this could stay up their tradition they do that every game and Michigan was trying to make sure that they knew what time they're going to do that walk through\nAnd actually we're on the field and then they claim Michigan State showed up late and they said they were going to be there so that's why there are a little bit surprised to see the Spartans out there in the field and they were out there at the same time but it's a I don't know ethics like that uh I I just can't figure out why that has to be whether it has to happen but it did I Know what to eat rivalry but a disease that grow up there\nIf you're in the area they've got that great second pizza special it's just three dollars and Seventy six cents or your second pizza tonight at Mali against dining only by the way that Iowa Penn State gain\nThis coming Saturday at two thirty will be televised nationally\nOn ESPN it's going to be a photo that'll be really gave me watch Iowa State eleven Iowa to thirty you can have it on ESPN and listen to you\nTo watch or watch or listen to you and I it's perfect yeah you and I in western Illinois or one o'clock game so you you just you got all kinds of football to stay on top of next Saturday between ... am and about six o'clock then I think Dallas you Alabama at night maybe\nOoh yeah you get what you make\nAnother\n...

I Do not white fur ball it's very predicated on to your previous previous season was and that's why those envy FCC or need big sky teams always up here and the colonial teams always appear right at the very top\nYeah so's conferences are traditionally the strongest but there's a lot of bias towards your last three to five years on the ... rating which is why do not like it ...\n... ... what\nDo you want to send you a tax saying the site where he was no good and then you touched\nMe back on hold [laughter]\nYeah but yeah I like\nTo know why I don't like ... radio as far as football so I mean he's he's tremendous when it comes to basketball and I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that you got\nThree hundred and fifty actually this year there's gonna be three hundred and fifty three teams up for free if you want and you know you got twenty eight to thirty three thirty four game so you get a lot\nBetter mix the ... really good for basketball but for football it's it doesn't work very well besides this kind of Iowa number nine [noise]\n[laughter]\nSo so the math the Massey ratings in Massey rating right now our strength of schedule one of the one of the top two top the schedules in MCS clipped bald how much how much do you think that gets used when the the committee sits down at the end of the year to to see the team's place in the teams\nAs far as seeding I don't know that it means a whole lot it definitely means a lot as far as getting into the bracket actually if you look at that a little closer it also has northern Iowa ranked as having the number one schedule remaining\nI don't know if you notice that or not [noise] I did not see that\nYeah right right well when you're looking at the ... this was trying to do something that it's going to be a Congress ... between the two because we knew because you've seen the chart that Massey plugs up the right next to the strength of schedule there is a category that says as a south and that's the future strength the strength of schedule future\nAnd northern Iowa was number one there too so\nWow ... ... and then there's the heart of\nTill they still have the hardest screaming scheduling the entire country so\nThat's an ad and interesting wow Mm yeah it's it's\nGoing to ... you know for northern Iowa later on they're going to come down right now as far as the Massey ratings go it's going to come down to like northern Iowa Colgate\nAnd someone like Delaware will Delaware is going to be nine and to and from the CIA so they would give us pause but Colgate he doesn't play anybody even though they're going to be undefeated against steps the U.S competition so they're not gonna you know I wouldn't give them a bit or northern Iowa so\nI Would say right now that whole Chris I made a reference to it earlier about Jacksonville state losing the female\nOuch shells to enough chaos it looks like right now there's no one would I Would get a laugh street now let's hope to Delaware or are you on her James Madison will lose another games with older I get out of that have flung out in the ...\nJust let her and I I actually called the calling show after show after the game this last weekend and I told my Davis I was like much better to play\nThe vice soon in 'frisco instead of Fargo\nThis last weekend and I told my dad was always like much better to play the vice president and first go in Fargo\nYeah yeah I was just going to go there and ask you what what else would have to happen if you and I went out to where they could get to the the seven seat or you know the seed that would keep them on the opposite side of the bracket\nOr up north Dakota state because you mentioned to me yeah ... you're going to catch North Dakota state in the semis in Fargo or in order to do\nSo so so what would have to happen to get up to the seven seed and then avoid them until 'frisco\nYeah you're going to need you know right now I've got three ... teams actually getting seeds\nBecause all\nThree of them would have to last a long ... how to game under stormed out so bad for those teams will be seven and want to see a kind of feeding off you know being off each other one at a time and\nThen he all three of them you think they all three would get a seat\nOr they don't mean to her eight seven and wandering calling for so yeah I didn't call for even want to get seeds especially with the chaos without this last week in Jacksonville said who just lost a seat at all\nWould be kind of saw state 'cause they play the last game of the year of current lock Kennesaw straight from probably two or three seat right now at the white probably off the shore because their conference ... picks out those very weak\nWarm up is probably going to finish a free and they got the benefit of the doubt last year they won't get a bit this year\nWhat about the big sky ... at the big guys going to be crazy 'cause they don't you know that you could have a multiple times near the top of that conference standing does just one big sky team get a seat or did they get to you think\nThey'll get through a Massey ratings right now the eastern Washington and\nHere she gave us both finishing two and seven and wanting to offerings they also have the whole state finishing someone who won but it'll be eight and three or like the whole state would have ... whoever did this week you know they only

the themes in your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to these\nBut these people early on\nUnderstood liberty better than most of our neighbors and fellow citizens to\n\nAn early on early early on you had to get permission\nFrom the governors of these colonies most of whom were you know installed by the Brits to write something so they they started to do these pamphlets to get around all of that\n\nOne of the earliest printers not the earliest but one of them was Benjamin Franklin's brother and then later Benjamin Franklin\n\nThis whole idea of freedom of the press what do they come from\nIt came from them those white slave owners\nAlthough Franklin ever owned slaves but you get the point\n\nThat for freedom of the press came from freedom and the press and freedom of speech was synonymous\n\nAnd they were promoting a republic they were promoting individual liberty they were promoting private property rights they were fighting the ... positions in viewpoints\nThey were fighting them\nAlmost every day when you read a so called news article\nEach trashing our country\nNow let's go back to that first sentence for this piece on Fox America has a massive growing racial wealth gap let me ask you a question\nWhy do people risk their lives to come here\nBecause that senses telling you that America is racist and there's not equal opportunity in America that's what that senses\nTelling why do people of color AKA non whites why are they flooding into America why are they leave in Guatemala and Honduras and Mexico\nIn one country after another in central and South America why are they leaving one country after another on the African continent why they leaving one country after another and Southeast Asia\nEven China why are all these\nPeople coming to the United states if there is a massive growing racial wealth gap there is no opportunity for non whites is that it\n\nOne of the problems we have in this country thanks to the left weather in the media or entertainment and elsewhere is a lack of promoting assimilation\n\nA lack of promoting assimilation learning English learning American laws learning American practices embracing American culture I mean after all he came to United States to escape\nThat culture of your birthplace right isn't that what a refugee is isn't that what an illegal alien does otherwise white come to America\n\nAnd America you see is so racist as a country\nThat as Iraq Obama and Joe Biden used to say by twenty forty four\nWhite people will be in the minority\nThere so race obsessed with America is so racist white Americans allow that\nBecause America as a country is not racist\nThat's why\nPeople should be encouraged to embrace capitalism they should be encouraged to embrace entrepreneur ship they should be encouraged to embrace the private sector as a profit motive creativity productivity rather than government government government\n\nBecause the vast majority of people do not succeed by getting a government check\nIt destroys them it destroys initiative it destroys independent thinking it destroys the human spirit which\nIs exactly why the left pushes it so let's go back to this story\nAmerica has a massive growing racial wealth gap\nNow for the left of course that means more government more redistribution higher\nMore regular you know\nIn more and more and more to govern\nGoes on the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of the median black family\n\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap that caught my attention his idea is to give lower income\nKids kids age ...\nAnd that caught my attention his idea is to give lower income kids kids a sizable nest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\nDid you hear this where are you familiar with this\nThese they call them opportunity accounts\nThey don't call these marches accounts they call them opportunity accounts [noise] what theoretically now this is the article this is the news article it doesn't say that it's an opinion piece\nThese opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grew up in wealthier homes\nSounds cool right equality\nIt'll be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty bunkers set an interview with Fox we can rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me now that will never be\nAny discussion of where this money comes from never nobody cares what kind of taxes why Comey increase who cares what kind of additional debt will have to be accumulated who cares\nNone of it matters\nWe're talking about the quality results economic inequality we're not talking about liberty don't confuse us with liberty don't confuse us with markets don't confuse us with opportunity no don't you see\nWe have a racist country\nWe need to take money give it to poor people poor kids up to fifty thousand dollars\nSo they can moving in the middle class who say\nThat simple\nOne and I think of this why didn't anybody think of this these are opportunity accounts after all ladies and gentlemen were coming into the the modern era the modern modern era I guess economics don't matter that doesn't matter tax rates are irrelevant\n\nWe need an opportunity account up to fifty thousand dollars a kid what's the big deal at ... at it free college and ... acid free health care and while we're at it open borders\n\nAnd why were added why don't you destroy the country\nWhere the richest country in the face of the earth or even our poor people live better than most poor people in the rest of the world they don't have local state and federal welfare systems\nFood systems\nHousing benefits they don't have them in these other countries we have him in this country thanks to the productivity of individuals who get up every morning and go to work and come back in the evening\nAnd contribute to society\nWhy do we spend all our time attacking the people who create wealth who create this magnificent society who built things who produce things who make it possible for people who don't even do those things\nTo have some form of material wealth food clothing and so forth\nYou kill the golden goose he will not have those golden next\nI'm telling you I'm telling you you need to do more than just vote\nYou need to take five six seven eight nine ten people with you or you need to make sure they vote\nOr this is your future this is your future\nAnd I'm Talking to all people all income groups all races all religions all genders and so forth\n[noise] this is your
