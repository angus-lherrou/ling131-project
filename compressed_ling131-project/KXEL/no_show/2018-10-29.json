P. hotline get our first guest on the show today Jared stansberry of like blown fanatic dot com joining us live on\nThe show today in another big win for I was state Jared they fell behind early in this game tend to nothing to Texas Tech what did you see that happen in the next three quarters where the they put together forty points and won that game forty thirty one\nYeah I mean I think the big thing is\nYou know they were able to limit some of them is that the ... the first couple of matter you know their ... their first touchdown on a large part\nAh and then you know give up three hours to defense we are and then you're able to go first of the game and in the defense was about as good as ... as you ... minutes as dirty that has been you know the last several weeks in the office just woke up a little bit you know you get to your turnovers earth return it was just\nA lot of the the one of them turning into a pick six from march so there's a you're just able to to get their own game going a little bit more\nOr just to take advantage of some most architects and of course you're going to\nTurn it really felt like the stars came to play Saturday David Montgomery at rush for a hundred and twenty five yards to touch down a key butler he had a couple of drops but he still ... four passes for a hundred and forty yards and a huge touched down how important was to put those two to have a big game\nYeah I mean I think that any time out it's important for for those two guys to come up big and I think that maybe some of what was really hurting the officer early on in the day and where\nDoes it couldn't gr much room to to do a lot it gets that touches ... square or to see it was was a lot better than what I even expected to be going into the game and then\nUh you know her team had a little trouble they're\nMoving to a game or the ... of a lot of attention towards stopping him and I'm ... catches to\nRead it off there for that are still passing our fence and it just eventually allowed in a little bit more open to them like motions you are I think that they're stuck in a state to serve on the bomb and just trying to whom the clock\nThere late in the game after they took one of them are about ... ... to ... do you ... them or you know he just made another exploded at the same things we're ... we're due to surprise using\nJared stansberry underbelly GM VIP hotline you can read his work at psych loan fanatic dot com block party maybe not you know super short maybe not quite as good as as he bent and some of the previous games that that he played in but\nBut he was good enough to help lead that team to that wind just what did you see out of the freshman quarterback\nYeah I mean I think that that that's kind of what it comes down to quite well enough you know and obviously doesn't need them to go and put up for it put a foreigner too large total often which is a first extended playing time against Oklahoma State\nAre are obviously doesn't need them to go out and put it for her put a foreigner too large total often which is a first extended playing time against Oklahoma State you know they need him to be out there and a mentioned plays with his legs if he can he was able to do that\nHe plays a lot of he was able to do that and then get to the ... the ball and the hands of\nOf severely electric claim acres and in jazz like David and his team and ... and and the entire group of guys and or you know that's where we saw him do on Saturday\nAnd I think really the big thing is that I was they went up there was a game plan that you know they're going to play conservative and they're going to charge for such that's been making some mistakes that that set the cycle cycling is up to ... to come out the window of a you know I think you're right about twenty six birds\nOn the flip side Allen Bowman mature freshman quarterback for\nA Texas Tech for more than fifty and you know you saw him make for mistakes that that kind of ended up you know in the game up for the cycles and uh I think that ... Campbell was going to try and force ... freshman quarterback into making them the same losing states' rather than his own\nChaired the defense was great is always the ... was good enough special teams on the other hand could have been a thorn in the side a missile kick a block pump for a touchdown well what is coach Campbell saying about the play the special teams right now\nYeah I mean he said after the game that you know it wasn't there and that's pretty obvious to see them in the way to revoke that then we're the last couple of weeks then uh\nI don't know what it's going to come down to whether or not it's not a chef when some online wiser you know change you know some of the ... but I Know that something that they are reevaluating here this week we're looking at ...\nOr ... or a Chris talked about uh the the good play a Marcel spears and running back David Montgomery another hundred ... a hundred plus yard rushing game hundred and twenty five to be exact thirty three carries to get it the two interceptions for\nFor a ... spears junior but who else do it out in this when as there are there any other guys that you thought or an ... you mentioned I think to Hakim butler the wide receiver with the forward catches hundred and forty eight yards receiving a touchdown that's a big able or the other kind of stars of the game Jared\nThey I think really you know a big one that I think of is is Corinne Bailey who was just continue to prove week after week that you know he he's one of the the best defensive lineman to ever play at Iowa State you know and that uh he he moved to the numbers on the ...\nContinues to move up on the single season charts as well I think that this is going to be one of the best because we've ever seen by and I was a sense of ... and when it's all said that\nGot to believe that the the same theme that coach parents and his team is talking about or even maybe yet today with the loss at Penn State thirty twenty four missed opportunities let's bring in a guy that covers I Will Hawkeye football for the Des Moines register Mark Emmert joining us live on her village in\nThe I. P. hot lemon and mark we're going to get we're going to get to that interceptions it that was thrown late when it looked like I was going in for the go ahead touched down in the closing minutes but you gotta you gotta talk about the start of the game or didn't I Would jump out like at\nTwelve to nothing lead with a couple of a couple of safe season\nI don't know where they did the the fake uh didn't they do a fake field goal thing for I mean they they did some crazy stuff that that puts him points on the board and the first half\nYeah it was a really really strange started to the game or a pets they got the ball first won three un out\nPunter dropped the ball right in his hands are blocked it out to the doctor a safety\nOr they went down got a field goal later than they had the the ... feel goal you mentioned in the yard line no less a on a really great catch a break for defensive tackle by trade made a kind of Willie Mays got over the shoulder catch in the end zone but that one\nAnd it really did what they talked about doing it took a crowd of the game I thought I thought if I could have done at the beginning of the gay they wouldn't want it because that was a that was kind of job number one to them and I and that crowd was really really quite like I heard some booze\nOr early on from the Penn State crowd so they did everything they want it to their um got a little safety later to make a fourteen of settled on another botched a pawn to exchange\nFor for Penn State so some ... ... almost ready for Penn State of Iowa you know took advantage of a little bit\nBut the one thing that was going to pick and there was that I was up at that really got going they kept getting short fields um you know the the ... are setting up really well Iowa and uh it was kind of the theme of the game that off as we could not take advantage of what these ... games on the fence was giving them then eventually of course that caused them\nA game that that I Will lead early but then Penn State ties it it's a Seventeen Seventeen game at the half you just knew that\nAnd that that I Will lead early but then Penn State ties it it's a Seventeen Seventeen\nGame at the half you just knew that that it was going to be one of those games that we we've seen Penn State school or in the in the closing seconds of the game before we've seen I Will win\nYou know a wild games against Penn State and in previous years also you had to know that that the second half was going to probably be a a crazy thirty minutes of football\nYeah I think it was really fortunate for say that they were tired of halftime because a trace it solely got knocked out for a couple of elections there too with an injury that doesn't like everything's going to go I was waiting for them to be tied at half time was kind of a minor miracle frankly for Penn State I mean\nI got the ball for the second half and they went five strip positions with hunting I mean they just could not moving again and that was to me that was kind of the game that they had a chance to maybe a\nTake a lay there and it puts them point to that weren't separation between the and Penn State that could not do it and then eventually they were down a ten going in the fourth quarter so that was a to me that was kind of where they wanted a lot of chance there because they have time for a time that the ball in pretty good the opposition and this cannot cannot move that\nMark Emmert sportswriter uh with the Des Moines register that covers I Will Hawkeye football was in happy valley covering I Will foot bold enough thirty twenty four loss to Penn State in which it it just would have been a huge win for I Would get out of there with the victory and and it looked like they were going to pull it out in the closing minute\nThey get it first and goal at the three and\nAn interception is thrown and I know there's been a ... I just I mean I I heard it in the sports talk driving home from\n... Illinois from our gain listening to\nTo fans out a lot of people upset with me Stanley a lot of people wondering why in the world wouldn't you run it up for a downer too and try and punch it ... ... what are what are you hearing what's the ANC what's the thoughts on on how that thing a winter rye on that last possession for Iowa\nYeah I mean I'm hearing all that and more actually carry well first of all and they said I had a very or game by his status by any standards that certainly is that or she was just not himself that entire game uh Nineteen forty eight is not going to get it done or or maybe it's like you know forty nine whenever he was sorry Tina forty nine\nTo ... got sacked three times he was hurt seven times he's under pressure lot\nNot responded that pressure well so what happened there they have to have the ... first to go through with all the time outs left three Eighteen left in the game and uh they're down six as he said and a ... there was a ... a passing play called and they only go to the last go around and saw\nWhat he thought would be a golden opportunity to change a play and get an easy touched on a tour and young ... that play was wide open up because it could have got a cold and time [noise]\nBut to the game qualify clock was winding down and uh it it gets a communication all the players that play up and changed so they didn't look at it in time step the ball anyway and what happened was no fat was still telling is easily what's new clay was up there on on the slot\nAnd uh you know if that was supposed to move off line is going to take his guy with them into the end zone which would clear a path for torn yelling the running back to catch easy touchdown pass and he was a ... second slow in doing that\nSo that guy was filled out the safety was still there are\nA Stanley dropped back and just looked at me like he just threw a Baltimore area like a game and looked at ... I guess the tornado was gonna be out there and of course toward young ones out there but so is so is no fan so as the safety and I'm All right but between those two guys right to the safety for pretty easy interceptions they set up just load it to them and uh\nAnd it was a killer like ah they were they were trying to kill time out late there were they there was a lot of confusion I play\nAnd that's your all your rights all of that was just as a disaster for Iowa it's called time out if they ran the ball instead or even she can run of the center said if I just had held on to the ball and and not step and just taking the five hour delay of game penalty I Wish I Would have done that retrospect because he saw that there was this amount of\nSomething going on behind that he didn't quite recognize styles and it was just a the worst possible outcome I mean it was very while they work down there were students section is so I'm sure that they had a tough time communicating a hearing anyway that whole game but a\nReally um I got to say a veteran quarterback which Stanley is now\nNeeds to check out of that it's called time out or you know look for a stronger throw the ball away once he sees the play has kind of gotten blown up didn't do any of that\nAnd the result was a you know they lost the game I mean they they could have taken the lead there which you know I mean they still would have that pretty much tougher for a trace of somebody to come back it's not like they got it was a guaranteed when at that point but certainly they should've been up thirty one thirty there\nAre ... and ... we're talking with Mark Emmert sports writer with the Des Moines register that was a ...\nAt the Penn State I Will game on Saturday in happy valley ... and the these kids are Eighteen twenty two year old student athletes they're not pros we see pros mess up so I don't\nI don't want to you know just come down on Nate Stanley put it all on him but just from from being there and watching the game maybe talking to some of the guys talking to the coaches maybe even talking innate Stanley ...\n... ... ... ... pinpoint or a tribute maybe why\nWhy he wasn't sharp why he maybe didn't play as well as as we've all seen him play so far this year as the Hawkeye quarterback\n[noise] yeah no it's a tough one I think we just talk to them eighth obviously he was very despondent er and he's a he's a great kid and you raised in a stop on him but\nHe did not do enough to help his team win that's fair to say that and ah you know is it I mean he missed them wide receivers that you would have easy touched on the ... and early in the game\nOr right minded me a lot of what happened last year at Wisconsin which is another very hostile environment that I went into it and they certainly did not perform well and they don't walk incident but he was ... and uh I just don't know if the ... got to be a little too big for him there um and I know he was under a lot of pressure most he's got all year and that's not his things these constant claim pocket\nIs not so good when he's under pressure that's that's what the numbers bear out\nSo I'd say it's hard to explain I don't I'm sure he doesn't have an answer for it either we'll talk to you again tomorrow but uh you know it's a tough thing to watch the kids go through that because a lot riding on that game and a lot of fans that were coming from the bench which I think is really extreme\n'cause I don't think that would have helped at all but uh you know he just had a bad game and at that time and that's what the court parents said he said oh but I'm back he's a good player it just you know it happens to the rest of them\nAlso there's some video out there that ah I Believe it was the back judge on that play right people thought was a he was a put his whistle in his mouth started to raise his arms that the hockey guys were trying to call a timeout\nFrom the sideline they thought that's what the official was going to do is give I was a time out in that play never would have happened other people maybe it's on the Penn State side they're saying no he was getting ready to\nTo call the delay of the game penalty I ah well what what do you make of that whole situation to me if he's trying to make a delay of game called ... ... penalty like first but we ... what what are you are finding out about that scenario\nYeah I mean I don't I Would say we can't talk to the official so I'm not sure what what he saw what he thought he saw my my take on that are watching it was that he was looked like he was about to take all the time off but then he saw the other corner of his either the ball being snap\nAnd so I mean think about what would happen if you'd call it that time out\nAnd I that's what I touched down there and I'm dying to get crucified for the opposite thing so I mean he's in a really tough spot there because everything was happening at once\nHe was at least thirty or forty hours away from the coach that we're trying to call time out I'm not sure he was the closest official that play and ah I ... I guess I Do kind of lay on my ... if you'd like to play go and uh you know I think that's you know I was going to take the blame for that\nI'm not sure he was the closest officials that play and ah I ... I guess I Do kind of lay on my ... if you'd like to play go and uh you know I think that's you know I was going to take the blame for that they they uh put themselves in a bad position there and I I really don't think it's the officials full\nWhen in doubt play it out as we always said so damn right in the right you mark you know you talked about the pressure that need Stanley was under all day it just didn't seem like I was off into line was the same offensive line we seen all year any idea why\nWell I talked to two of them after the games you can read her interest in work and you're right it was their first year forms of the year they all acknowledge that um you know here's a here's the credit that Stanley had been hurried seven times all year coming on the scam he was hurt seven times alone on Saturday So\nAh the the past wanting in particular was not there the ... was a great either but the past slugging particular was a problem because if you drop back to throw forty nine passes so let me fill out of those plays\nIt and it to a modest yeah we covered a lot for you in the first hour there on things that happened over the weekend [noise] some of it not\nSuch exciting bond happy stuff but we do have some than happy\nSomething good something positive to talk about after news and whether Mitt but terrorists who covered the un I paint their men's basketball\nExhibition opener victory over ward bird hundred intend to sixty nine will tell us what he saw on how the first look at this you and I paint their men's basketball gene how ... how they look Mick [noise] joins\nAfter news and whether you stay with us\nBack after this [noise]\n...\n\nAnd accused killer in court ...

twenty four you could email us ... press row at KFC out that time we'll talk\nMore about that you and I paint their football last a western Illinois on the show today after you and I lost thirty seven seven teams and crazy things happened in that game from you and I being unable to to score when they got in the red zone or early on in the first quarter first to possessions in the red zone and the Panthers\nHundred percent of the time going into that game Saturday one hundred percent of the time the Panthers\nPut points on the board\nIn the reds are not every time scored a touchdown but always got points and at a pretty high percentage score touchdowns when they got in the red zone Saturday first two times you and I had the football they were in the red zone came away with just three points\nYou get a couple of touchdowns their ... fourteen to nothing that probably a whole different game then you had that that whole\nControversy I I called the controversy end of the first quarter or excuse me the first half\nWestern Illinois in the closing minute hunting from the back of their own end zone un I partially blocks it recovers the football at the Thirteen yard line of western Illinois going in\nCovered it up at the Thirteen and uh somebody on the un I sideline celebrating the the partially blocked punt the recovery the play evidently bumped the the female a field judge\nOn that farce on that you and I sideline bumped into her and she threw the flag and a lot of times if there's a sideline infraction there's a sideline warning the first time but it was a it was a sideline infraction with contact\nAnd there's no warning I guess for that and they tacked on a Fifteen hundred penalty against you and I and moved it from the Thirteen to twenty eight of the leather next\nThat's a whole different possession with forty five seconds to go from the Thirteen than it is the twenty eight and and on a third down play ah ill I'd done through an intersection that stopped the drive in and so those missed opportunities and then\nWe'll get coach far at least thoughts on all that and and the talk about that but that that first half ... really\nTwo words explained it missed opportunities now without a\nDoubt I mean the score to complete different ballgame even if you hit score one touchdown make a field goal it's probably different ball game of the six points you're feeling pretty good but when you miss that first kick you know it's kind of takes the air out of the sales a little bit especially when it's a twenty four yard her into Earth I'm definitely knows that but he had to bounce back in the Panthers they just didn't\nTalked to keep off the court by it's going to be hard to find him minutes as well so and it's good to see him have a good starting especially you know what the picture it out and uh you know you don't know how long it's going to take him to get back up to full speed I I think it's good to have somebody like miles\nOr that can come in and give you some quality minutes now it'll be interesting to see\nYou know to see some progress has how coach Jacobson manages that bat court but ah\nDefinitely it's one of those situations where he can get a lot of guys in there somebody struggling with a shot or you can get somebody else in there that that can be coming in and make some shots to\nWhat were coached Jacobson biggest takeaways from from the scrimmage\nI think he was a real happy with how the ... locked 'em ... ball movement a especially you know the first half that defensively are able to get some stops transition game\nI think are the only critique maybe it'd be started the second half kinda got slowed down a little bit a word bird was scoring points there and then they had to run things through the ... more to begin that second half of them so I think he still wants to see\nA little bit more out of the the half court um and then obviously defensively I think they're gonna have to be better parameter defenders weren't bird shot or ten of twenty two from three point range so you can't really be given that up a once once you get into the season either so I think there's room for growth there on the defensive and but\nAs a whole I I think he liked the the the contributions he got out of a variety of different players and like the intensity that they're able to play with and and the ... that that was a showcase there uh for for opening day\nI Know your main assignment was to cover you and I men's basketball but you did get a look at at work bird nights a men's basketball ... what did you think how do they look for a division three team in the uh the what's it called the rivers time\nFor an American rivers on American rivers yeah yeah on the ... the river and the Missouri River and there there are the American rivers now one of the\nCall it the ... I just can't get that on my head what what did you see what did you think of work for\nA worker or they're they're trying to play a little bit different style coach pays mentioned or he's going to try to go more up tempo as well so that that was kind of a tough match up with you and I also going up tempo and having a bunch of guys draining threes on them but I think uh like I mentioned that second half once they settled and they're able to get some good things done and\nUh they had the suspense or a turtle I think he's from Denton community came off the bench and had a five or seven three pointers so he's\nA guy that can shoot it and their their top scorer from last season here and say this is back and uh he was five ten from the field five five from the line really good player I a five to this one turnover I I think he's going to be a great player in that conference this year and a\nAnother local kid a camp kicked Bush I remember from glad Brookline back was a valuable leader for them is in their starting lineup on I I think they have some guys that that can get some things done there and they have some depth they I think in American never sailed definitely be you know in that top three\nYou and I back on the hardcore with their final exhibition game this Thursday night and the competition steps up ratcheting up a notch when division to upper Iowa and Brooks McCowan come to town just ah what do you think about that exhibition match up for you and I\nEcho shake ups in touched a little bit on that game I towards the end of the the press conference yesterday and I did the biggest concern with ... Brooks team Brooks his team he like he likes to get up and go and are there going to be able to do a lot of things in transition that's really good shooter so I Know Joe small to\nA former Mr basketball's on their in their line up I think they might solve Carson Parker around out from Viking Hartford I'm not sure if he graduated or not but but he might be a veteran still back I asked\n... he's ... he's on their coaching staff now he's on their coaching sent me a hundred and all that and it's I'm missing these names might you covered him probably in his high school days to yep yep but by no Joe still there right yes yes yup\nHe's going to be able to shoot it and they've got some kids that can get up and down the floor and so I think it's going to be another up tempo game and I think they're they're going to probably push a little more than than warfare given in transition so are you and I said transition defense will get tested a little bit here on Thursday\nYeah and and we certainly know that the competition gets extremely tough when you get into the the regular season with the division one schedule that you and I will play but ah I just I I gotta believe people should be optimistic should and they are about the prospects for you and I men's basketball this year\nYeah I think it you know it's a different style it's is there one of the slowest I think in pay supply in the nation last year and that's definitely not going to be the case this year um and I I just think with the the young kids that they have come in and uh you know it's gonna be exciting to watch them progress it's gonna be a team that's going to get better is facing\nA goes on and uh hopefully a you know Taiwan and uh Austin can can come back to full health and contribute here to down the road and I I think they're really going to have some some good depth and I think they have some explosive players and and some guys that are going to be I'll be worth watching\nYeah I'd like to think that Taiwan picked Britain both him and Austin five can get a hundred percent healthy and and be ready to join this day and that's a couple of what I Would have thought he ... in this paint the roster panther line up this year to to have the season they want to have picked burden in Austin fight\nOh yeah especially with Austin I think ah you know you don't like we mentioned before you don't have a ton of experience coming back and that front court and his uh definitely the most experienced front court player a from a season and go so so I think they're going to need him to be able to contribute at some point\nWhat do you think is what's the latest with them to have you been able to uncover\nOh yeah he's just been he's been he's been out of practice the the last week so they're they're still working on things medically so they're not even a cut shake ups and he wasn't really are going to entertain a you know a timetable until they get things straightened out there so he's he's out and definitely so I think they're going for\nAnd he wasn't really are going to entertain you know our timetable until they get things straightened out there so he's he's out and definitely so I think they're going for it if the guy they have right now and I just hoping that that things can progress here for two across\nAll right Nick thanks appreciate the inside them appreciate the time when that will be in touch with you throughout the basketball season\nRight now it's getting extra time Gary\nNick but terrorists sports writer with the Waterloo Cedar Falls courier who covers you and I paint their men's basketball this season for the courier we come back with more of a Monday edition of all PR after this\nWell they did it again I needed a couple of new front tires after all the miles I've driven this past season so without an appointment I pulled into science Charlie's independence were they so Cooper Tires they're experts sales and service department had me in and out in no time you see science Charlie's built their business on customer service\nBass courteous friendly service stopping for all your tie your needs they'll give you the same great service that I got make the short drive to science Charlie and let them earn your business science Charlie's independence where they sell Cooper Tires and tell them the sports guy sent you\n[noise] this is Jeffrey lions with today's baseball trivia questions some people as if this one or two players appeared in a combined total of sixteen World Series and they have a connection to the days you six Nineteen forty four you know what it is back after this what the answer\nMy name is Larry my mom and dad used to fight about money all the time why don't I think in talking about scams uncle ... con ...\nY facing a phone wiring bend a toll on like ... when they get very in dollars today car they kind of ... ... ... ... or ...

when the journeyman relatives there no humans fine with that stuff you know to make it yeah I and I don't make good dog I got a real oh yeah All right\nJoe take your good to hear from you Joe checking in from daycare you and I panther at football coach mark barley after\nThe game talking about that last a western Illinois when we said coach it just you got to be thinking it was missed opportunities for your team today\nAbsolutely it was you would just turn the game or and literally what the turnovers enough [noise] than they are [noise] you know the [noise] you know when you're from uh football's [noise] uh\nWhen you're blowing opportunities right for half time I mean Russia's quarter the first drive for even miss the kick Joe scored on the last driver for halftime and throwing intercept scored in the first Dr second half I mean you go right down the list and that's how I feel so a lot of missed opportunity as well he'll he'll take from this\nYou know the other thing we talked about last week as people fans love to talk about a trap game again that's a trap game for your team where you just came off a huge when you got another a top twenty five ranked opponents in two weeks and then you're playing a team that's unrated that\nYou know sitting there with a three and four record and you know maybe it's a it's a trap\nGame where you guys don't get is fired up or locked in as they need to an end you know it's a coaches are trying to impress it on their players all the time sports that you you got to bring it every game especially in the Missouri Valley football conference these teams are all really really good well coach good talent\nBut I asked coach Farley and the post game show they they just sense\nThat maybe the guys might be\nA bit offer or or maybe just not quite as sharp as as you want him to be just sense that at all leading up to the game against the law there next\n[noise] I'd I'd much I Want to say yes I'll say no because we weren't very good at all before the south of course they wake I thought we were terrible that we can\nOnly play good and then I thought we all this week was just like any other way when I say terrible terrible our standards so they were actually there most nine nine percent of time they're very good but it's it's just that whatever happened here day\nWas unfortunate because it that's a hard way to learn and then when you have a\nFence at his as experienced as ours is two and a half ago and\nThat's what it is frustrating for me because it was our team was that group that should be the more experienced group and the defense\nAnd both sides we've got even the even Austin is the first ... from the six yard line so we all can say we're part of the opportunities that were missed one hour coaches are players so you went as a team loses a team in such a better\nAnd better looking at yourself in the mirror when you're going to practice mom look at the film that you know what are you going to do about it [noise]\nA DJ volt collect the assistant head coach for you and I paint their football in the line backers coach does a great job helping Jeremiah Johnson in that defense the staff if the defense ready he uh stepped in for coach Farley today at the un I paint their coaches weekly press conference and I asked him the same thing just to\nSee you know different cultures different thoughts maybe somebody\nSaw something sent something I and I said coach bulk like did you\nSense that it would be hard to get the guys\nBack up to the level that you liked to have a mat for this game people talk about a trap game or did did just sense anything during the week or prior to the game that maybe that the team wasn't as as fired up or is locked in as you would have liked them to be\nSo I you know when it's against south coast there was obviously a big one force but I think the the mentality of\nFormer players in her coaching staff is in Missouri Valley conference every game that you play as a big football games um it doesn't matter whether you play at home or you play on the road [noise] um every came this week is is capable [noise]\nUm I don't think we had the sense of that going into the western game for um you know there are number of factors that contributed to why we didn't play will go off and said we on the defensive coach but I'm the office of coaches and encourage froze priority addressed the turnovers the missed opportunities that we had and then on the defensive side of the football\nYou know a big place or hurt us miss tackles a poor angles those kinds of things technique was is is you know when we looked at the film [noise] those are the things that we've we've obviously got to get corrected coffins we've got to take care of the football we've got\nWe've got to take advantage of opportunities when we have them in in defense we we've got to be more consistent room and I put poison I Do a better job of flying to the football taking good angles around some people up and\nDoing those kinds of things so I I wouldn't say that uh there was a there was a sense you have to do was flown on a lot of credit is good football team players and they may be more pleased when we didn't we made mistakes that we know is is to Africa to come back and we got to get corrected because we're coming to heck of a football team this week so\nYou know every week uh is is a is a tough test in the conference and I think our kids to understand that\nYou and I lost the turnover battling this one too I think western Illinois and the first

any American president period\nTo those who seek to destroy the Jewish people we will seek to destroy them I didn't hear that from Obama told me was the president's call to destroy anti Semitism a dog whistle designed to win the support of anti Semite ...\nIs President Trump the reason anti Semitism is growing in Europe and on our college campuses as President Trump to resume Jews in France can't walk the streets without being physically attacked or even killed which President Trump the reason Jews in Israel or face anti Semitic turned violent for Seventy years\nOr thirty five hundred years is President Trump the reason Jews in Israel have to defend themselves\nAs President Trump the reason the leader the British Labour Party is an anti Semite is President Trump the reason Louis Farrakhan

the media in this country did far failed to do in the thirties and forties [noise]\nWhere they turn on this president [noise]\nAs they turn on him for everything [noise]\nThere's some things truly

nitric\nPercent could be thirty thousand Americans [noise] um and there is a stream of saying it could be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis that could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people\nGoing into social media as you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous than it is giving\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel we monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way with and you were laws constitutional rights that Americans have\nTo figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of this kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel um and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think\nGiven that these all these haters are communicating with each other\nI think it's important for your uh forties to see what they can do to\nPrevent the next attack and you also have armed guards and many of your scenario\nYeah that's that's a reality but unfortunately juice face around the world if you go to London and the Pentagon you are more likely than not to\nSee actually a policeman or police or outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays will shut on your keyboard many synagogues you do have a local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven\nBut this was just choose going about their business praying and in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue in America needs that type of protection protection is it's sad but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population\nBut to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak up for very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had you know what the strongest combinations frankly I've ever heard I've never heard of non Israeli non Jewish leader say those who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that from any leader\nAnd not only was it that ... that I did was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the calls he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he said that uh and it's important for\nPeople on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremists like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there is no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nYou know mainstream conservatives have never consider themselves for writer embrace thing but do we were ... people like that but we do the growing bbs movement in this country it's growing in our college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which is\nIn mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and political organizations in Europe and even someone in the United states this again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic anti Jewish anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero France to Semitism and holding Israel up to standard holds and all of the nation on earth when you live you know two thirds of the ... channel is simply U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past if not a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying but you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with ... we have always been seen as the ... area of the ... in the coal mine\nOf in a civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the news\nUm it's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly more put all the politics aside and stand together whether you're on the right of conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat and and they noticed kind of hate and and the lead by showing that\nThis type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely putting politics aside but I've been watching as I'm sure you have in the United states our media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this is Trump Trump Trump this\nAnd this killer this mass murder this this Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump too many Jews around them now you have in President Donald Trump man my view the the greatest supporter of Israel but any American president\nHe's knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they promised they never did it before he took his Randy oh which was passed\nCapital no president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nAnd the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states in Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American is a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\n[noise] yeah I mean I I said this for a we've never had\nA strong supporter of Israel with President Trump a and frankly it hasn't even been close\nIn terms of what he's done I mean you look at some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously there's always some in the case you are looking at the medical team at the plant it they call or the annihilation of one and only to restate that you have Hezbollah\nUh ... Iran did actually one of his ... leaders said a few years ago that he hoped poetry or companies will so we can wipe them out there so the president of the United states stood up to the entire world and withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran\nHas torch sank tens and against Iran and\nIn doing so he is star of this anti Semitic terrorist regime of hundreds of billions of dollars that would be honest to\nPick\nA Israelis are and and also at the front and all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal with Israel and the Arab world closer together but we we appreciate very much in a very grateful for that support it like I said I'm very grateful that the president forcefully\nA condemned or the anti Semitic attack I I think it is very very important I think people think it all of these things happen [noise] ah because of President Trump's election ... they're just getting them so they don't understand\nThe history of anti Semitism it's not only the world's longest hatred older sacred it's the most malleable hatred I mean Jews or [noise] or\nHad been attacked and killed for being a capitalist for being a communist for being the biggest goes for being the biggest hawks were being called old for being called you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate that it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific acts\nThat people will stand together against at the Senate does President Trump is not the reason why you have like Jeremy Corbyn\nIn Europe or the head of the British Labour Party who's an anti Semite it's not the reason why you have all these attacks and a half for many years and Europe against Jews unfortunately this thing is have come here to the United states and ... and has now killed eleven\nWorshipers and and so we'll have a pitch for but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put the politics and understand that there are people who were anti Semite talked all sides\nAnd people stand together against this call out the anti Semite on the side of the political wild ...\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your own side whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever comes whether it's not a college campus with people trying to single out Israel and the same and demonize Israel and make all these wild charges that Israel's and apartheid state of racist state a perpetrator of canon dot\nWhich I think triggers a lot of people put a level of hatred towards the kicked out the of any other country this demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the tools I think they're going to be protecting everybody\nAll right and ... of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless and thank you sir\nThank [noise] he's really good okay I've laid out he's laid it out any objective news organization should be ... but they're not going to cause they're not objective and they're really no news organizations anymore not many of them\nYou know falls officially here temperatures across the country are dropping certainly are where I live after a long summer of running your air conditioning the times quickly approaching the start running your heater as temperatures Trump and most of the country\nThe national weather center saying the north and central part of the U.S will experience a cold or October than years passed now is the perfect time to consider servicing your system and replacing your age ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "29"}
