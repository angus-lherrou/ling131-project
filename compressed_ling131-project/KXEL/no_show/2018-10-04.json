that that story came out\nAnd then not much happened afterwards uh but that's where I really first you know got to know John Solomon some of his work he's been around you see them now on on different um\nYou know a panelists and uh on on different shows out there but he works for the hell dot com this from the hill congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers\nTo talk about Donald Trump and the Russian collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign a former FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney for Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThey must believe that the inspector general can find the corruption in the department of justice concerning the procedure over the Pfizer warns\nYeah\nYeah that's if you're listening for the first time I know that this is all calculus I think most people that I'm listening for a while to the show understand where we are going well it it it\nUltimately when you when you look at that especially with the G being given all this ah on redacted information from the White House\nYou you know that there's only one reason the inspector general exists that's to look and see if there's any kind of corruption or misdeeds\nStay late in the department of justice accounting irregularities thing has taken pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump clue to what the Russians to act the election mhm that was the initial charge or what have we all find out and we all know now nobody's debating it\nIs it was the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary campaign paid a law firm Perkins ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS who paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin unverified\nThat they then took to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign and when that didn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that under fight information that they got from the Russians\nAre to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that explains it all simply as you can explain it\nAnd a number of details coming about the you know with the Solomon a report that broke on on Wednesday\nWednesday evening and then of course you'd go back to the fact that a Bruce or or at the time a high ranking ah the official at the department of justice his wife worked for fusion GPS\nSo there are connections all over the place

Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\n[noise] hey how are you good that [noise] ah [noise]\nWell I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head\nIs what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that\nThe whole reason\nThey held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for it and the hearings by claiming that he gets kinda partisan and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh\n[laughter] so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and there is on the Supreme Court from this point forward [noise] they're going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself for abstain from any votes\nMay having to deal with anything they want to but they if they don't like to do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream at each\nWell they can be an eighth grade those lawyers she'll screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere\nAnd getting where with it OK because I've heard lawyers you know try and no show that judges you're recused themselves do ya how well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process that we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases where we've even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves a I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past\nAnd I remember I Can't get away we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then the ... but again that's up to them because if it's more\nOr there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company yeah Hi Anne Rice but they're gonna be any fear at that point you have to recuse yourself but to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't rule on anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not\nGoing to hold any water yeah you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate\nHis sister you know and it was like okay [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company\nIs indirectly working with my brother's company and and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well\nShe's part of his family but the the the process and you and I were having this discussion during the break there is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process not that they make\nA decision that we should always agree with in fact a a while I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter]\nBut we can talk about that but the procedure\nOn procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case or it is not\nIt is not driven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of him and then the media takes them and runs with ... often out of context\nAh they did that with Scalia um but\nYou know there's but but still in terms of the procedure is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nAnd but I I think you make a great point by\nIn terms of the procedure is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nBut I can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world but I'm the I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that is not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat the former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great ... great monies to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we haven't said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe\nAbout the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they don't even\nTo the door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two secret is likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the ... came out\nWhat they would do is look at that and go okay was there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh two except if they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that is simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge\nShips out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this was against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the set of complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority\nThat is a more construction is well journalists core and then\nLearning of this this rule now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never would've you know that's the hope that when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this exists did write her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not that would not have been able to collaborate and then at that point\nIt died just like probably thousands of other allegation and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nOver the decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now it makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white work to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep

the other breaking\nNews and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last a couple of beers a this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know Well hi FBI\nLaw enforcement official a former official well the hilltop Tom John Solomon a has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats did a ... D you\nKnow they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election okay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes but I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign\nGave money to their law firm Perkins ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day unverified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy of his election after he was elected\nA lot of that information and that dossier promote we know was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins too we\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign when we got to the law firm they were well the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS to I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right and I would\nCounsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm that would be you could just easily\nAnd the the the I guess the\nPrinciples of that law firm and others and that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess a compartmentalize that as part of an investigative\nProcess why would why would the counsel for the FBI do as they say well ah well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion of just weeks before the twenty sixteen election\nBut it was lawyers meeting with lawyers\nRight why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys made it\nSo former general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firms mhm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay\nResearch firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a of an cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect the dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and it was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the size of court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker than was interviewed a gym beggar was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others or other than to say if confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins can we law firm\nAnd the FBI we bought the state of this I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah you can do about policies and all you could do\nProbably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons because\nWe've always broken down and since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking the so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or changed because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump\nOn verified information still today yes I Am I the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after [laughter] after ... after over two years or so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was to destroy the legitimacy of Baylor shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and\nAnd ... well faking it as intelligence instead of\nOpposition research to the size of court to spy on the Trump campaign if exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump yes they still make the say he's treasonous for washing collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party\nAnd all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true I don't know of anybody decide or or that as it tried\nTo even debated especially after the you know the work done by say or a quarter and Solomon and others that circle news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out um and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant\nEven though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth that's a problem for\nAnyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhere are you thinking about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know ... a a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a no cooperation for these particular stories like they they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats did what Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret yes\nNow that we know how

retain and attract talent or we for for a long time in Columbus and by the way Columbus is about half the size of the morning so uh it's a little bit different but a lot of the same principles apply\nBut wait for a long time we'd had a brain drain or people would grow up in Columbus and then they would leave a because there wasn't anything in Columbus to do or if there was anything Columbus there were no opportunities and\nAnd we've decided some two decades ago that we wanted to do something about it and we started working on our downtown area and we did a lot of the normal things that you do and you're downtown areas we headed to civic center and we added a performing arts center and we even editor river walk but a lot of cities have those things\nWhat we decided was if we really wanted to be different if we really wanted to transform our city door if people would say man that is a cool place to go let's go into the river we were lucky we had to hydroelectric dams they're obsolete\nAnd so we had to do something with them anyway they were either going to fall in or or deteriorate\nSo we blew 'em up we we went into the river and there was a great event to turn down there's a a and it was a it was an event just to blow a Mozart yeah I Know in in here in the morning when you all blew up the YMCA and that was that was an event to us so this was an event to blow up the dams and so\nWe blew 'em up and we had the same people you're working\nWith here in the morning great great group that the McLaughlin group fantastic engineers\nAnd they've Reese golf shirt if you will two and a half miles of a river and what that did is it created six or seven Rapids that ... that are very in and difficulty from class one declassify\nAnd so it was a it was a long process and it wasn't easy and we had to find it almost entirely a through a lot of private donations we did have the city in the state and the counties they all chipped in to but it was a public private partnership\nAnd I can say unequivocally we've been open now for five years um and we had our fifth year anniversary in May of this year and I can say unequivocally\nThe the the idea of having something like this that is fun that's good for water quality that's good for the environment that is good for economic development that's good for tourism I can say unequivocally we met all of our goals in ... expectations were\nHighly exceeded\nBut there was one category that we we expected some of this but we had no idea\nThat this this surprised us and that was the community pride in this venture once they were standing because when an Susie from California comes in the first place where you take an Suzie to down the road so she can see all the crazy things somebody surfed\nWhen an Susie from California comes in the first place where you take an Suzie too it's down to the river so she can see all the crazy things somebody surfing on the river whether they surfboard or somebody coming through in a in a in a raft and be flipped and thrown into the water and come out laughing\nIt it totally transformed the image the feel of our city and today our citizens are as excited about that as anything we've ever done in Columbus\nWe're talking with maps with ladies and gentlemen he is one of the people that was behind the project two and a half mile whitewater experience in Columbus\nGeorgia [noise] what was the pre sell like that a ... I suspect that when you started this project people were going what the hell you talk and we don't need the whitewater what do you what does the whitewater experience\nOh and there's no question about it and ... and this this will apply end up going to the same people or\nPeople assemble everywhere are absolutely when we first came out with this idea that well first of all people say I'm not going to get in that river his too dirty blah blah blah a then they'll say why why are we ever want to do this you know that kind of thing and\nWe need streets in effects in yeah\nI mean there's a paddle out in front of my you know blah blah blah and so there are a lot of skeptics or al ... and I the one I Love telling people about is I've got a good friend a lawyer friend up in Chattanooga and when they came out with the idea of a um\nA fresh water aquarium she called me and so that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of who would who wants to go see a bunch of catfish in an aquarium you know\nWell of course they build the Tennessee Aquarium they have a million visitors ghetto and same thing here we are a lot of skeptics and there were a lot of people because they can't see it right out a lot of people\nYeah they they don't understand that 'cause they can't see it if you if you can't fail a touch it smell it they don't understand it it's a part of the job was coming up with some good visuals\nTaking them to a ... at that time they were a few uh there was one out in Denver called confluence park it was one up in Richmond ah but they were brought up the small things compared to what we were trying to do so yes there was a seven job and there was a education jobs to the community that we had to\nExplain to everybody and we did we I mean we went to a rotary clubs we went to a garden clubs we we went to the board rooms of the CEOs we went to the state legislature we went to the council chambers\nAnd we sold a this vision and and gradually people started getting it they started saying that this particular initiative if you will\nA is so good for it on so many fronts if it's good on the environmental front is good on the economic development front it's good on the tourism front or it it it's good from the standpoint that you're providing something for\nFor your local people to do that no one would you don't think about\nColombian coming to Columbus, Georgia go whitewater rafting you can you think about the north Georgia mountains on the north Carolina mountains of Colorado Colorado whatever we ever got a rapid in Columbus, Georgia that's a class five rapid is as good as anything you can find out on the Snake River in ... in Colorado so\nSo it's been an exciting fun project where we're in a fifth year\nBut Michael I got to tell you this since I've when the group came down from Des Moines to Columbus I did a little research on the moon\nAnd I was really impressed with what I read a year or so ago but I've been here for three days and I am I'm a even more impressed and the thing that that I see is I think you all have an opportunity here\nThat's bigger and better than what we did in Columbus and the reason I say that is your plan has so many different elements to it\nThat we don't we basically it's basically a kayak or white water raft or low flow Haslam\nHere with the downtown projects into some sixty art projects out in the region there's something for everybody there and that is exciting because I'm\nA ... the whole the whole initiative is exciting but the fact that you can involved and engaged so many of your citizens in this is is really an exciting planes\nWe're talking with Matt swift ladies and gentlemen from Columbus, Georgia we are talking about uh the white water park experience that the planners here in the city of Des Moines are taking a really hard look at and then I Believe it's going to happen because\n... will be ... because of all of the things that you just said\nYou know if we can put projects in the realm of economic development and what that will do to\nAlleviate people leaving or ... or alleviate the opportunity to for the brain drain that's really positive I'm I'm curious about now you've been there for five years and ... your business community has changed dramatically in Columbus it was home to textiles and other\nOf manufacturing entities and today that's gone in another direction because those jobs are gone that's how has how is this project\nBeen helpful [noise]\nKeeping or attracting talent\nOh it's great question uh well I'll give you a good example we we've got a ... we've got the second largest a credit card processing company in the world and it's called ... publicly traded company they're right there in\nThe right there in Columbus we went to them and talk to them about this project and we got a million dollar grant from and the reason we got a million dollar grant from him was there in the business of\nOf hiring people and the people they're hiring a generally high tech kinds of people\nAnd the high tech kinds of people they want to come to her community that is fun that is that collect take that as a progressive and and when they saw this was going to be an added attraction dry downtown to everything else we've been doing [noise]\nThey they this was not a just a okay let me help you kind of donations this was just right richer her now an investment kind of check and so a ... half black is in Columbus now they gave to this body from the same or Asian\nOr ... of the leader in in charcoal grill you know getting the world they gave this project make that so and\nBut for each cigarettes because of what we call this cost free mentality\nSimply talking to kids about nicotine and the potential to become addicted wasn't enough\nThat these messages only became a more impactful if we tied addiction to other health consequences which is why kids will see in our ads whether they're on social media or literally we're putting posters and so the bathrooms of\nA more than ten thousand high schools around the country\nIs a discussion not just about nicotine\nOr that the air solved the paper and these products can contain things like formaldehyde and metal particles that's it's to break this cost free notion\nI'm a ... to to get them to think twice about even experimenting with this product because this is not a harm reduction debate this is not about what we need to do about the thirty four million addicted adults who are still smoking cigarettes\nThis is about preventing our children from ever starting on any one of these products\nWith the right kind of public education which we've just started an FDA during the rest of his job\nOr when it comes to compliance enforcement\nThis is called the real cost use each cigarette prevention campaign you're targeting those from age twelve just Seventeen give me an idea of what you were doing is part of this effort to reach those people nearly eleven million young people across the country\n[noise] uh we're gonna we're gonna find them wherever they're engaging in the use of media\nOr we have the ability if they're on school grounds and they're on a break\nA and a kid goes onto a YouTube or ...\nWill be able to shoot one of our messages to them while they're on those sites are as I said we're putting very provocative posters in the bathrooms of a more than ten thousand high schools around the country again one of the messages that it's going to be and posters brought to you by the food and Drug Administration\nIs following some of the gross things and this bathroom are in that vape\nVaping can expose your lungs to accrue Leon which can cause irreversible damage we're not running TV ads were not running a radio ads this isn't this is not aimed at adults and and and addicted adult cigarette smoker thinking of trying cigarettes to help get them off of cigarettes are we wish them walk that's completely separate\nThis is laser targeted at these at risk almost eleven million twelve Seventeen year olds around the country who either are already experimenting with the cigarettes or are at risk of trying\nWhen you look at other things that young people have become accustomed to more addicted to overtime going back a couple of generations what is unique about these hazard and what is unique about the way you are addressing it\nI guess the way I Would answer that is that um unfortunately there are some things going on with the cigarettes and kids today that are not unique if we go back to uh the Nineteen sixties in the Nineteen seventies and\nAnd the house cigarettes were uh were being marketed then the attraction of cigarettes or to kids unfortunately we're seeing some of the same thing today with these cigarettes whether it's\nThe presence of flavors that are very attractive to kids or we've taken enforcement action against manufacturers that were selling a liquids\nA vet that resembled juice boxes candy cookies breakfast cereal that use cartoon imagery um we're going after retailers that are illegally selling these products to kids\nUm so it's sort of like history as in the process of repeating itself\nAnd and that's what jeopardizes all the progress that we've made in reducing kids used to cigarettes historic lows or when it comes to kids use of conventional combustible cigarettes but again the research shows that if you just look at that group of kids that don't use any of these products at all\nKids who try an e cigarettes are more likely to try a regular cigarette than if they never tried the cigarette in the first place\nAnd do you find that they are more likely to try and ease cigarettes for all the reasons that we discussed the no cost impression as opposed to starting off with a traditional cigarette\nYes\nAnd there are multiple ways for them to get their hands on there's this phenomenon of social sources where they could be getting it from their friends\nUm or there may be people going in and buying large quantities of these things and then reselling them or to kids so that's why we have reached out to the manufacturers of the most popular national brands to say what are you gonna do about it this is a growing epidemic what are your plans to reduce\nReduce youth use of of this category of products in addition to FDA putting that policy options on the table or whether we need to take a look at a online sales are the presence of flavors and these products\nAre the restrictions on marketing while continuing to enforce it was very important your access restrictions\nShould we be somewhat skeptical at\nExpecting the industry to do anything substantive in that regard\nShould we be somewhat skeptical at\nExpecting the industry to do anything substantive in that regard\nI I understand your skepticism about um these companies have until mid November to come back to us with their plans\nAre they uh they need to take their responsibilities and their obligations to make sure that these products or being marketed in ... in ways that are appealing to kids or the retail level aren't being illegally so because\nThey need to take those responsibilities very very seriously as I said it is no exaggeration to say that this is a growing epidemic\nOr there is more recent data that is about to be released that will show an exponential growth in kids use of these products just from twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen\nAnd and the time has now for all of us to act to take this very seriously\nMitch if we're interested in more information work and we go\nTo very important

Waterloo there's a development agreement okay which is a legally binding document\nRight that is what sort of at issue and I'm going to summarize Mr Leslie in the news really ... publicly said he could not get financing\nThe indicated broadly past and current members of the council a are keeping him from it due to their public statements I'm not going to get in all of that because that is the issue\nDid the development agreement have a trigger for a closing date or a trigger that said if everything is not resolved by X date than the party's walk away or was there anything like that I've not read\nThat was that was yeah and in a in a in a in a in a broader so I really don't want to get into this I'm On this outlet allow other people to have their interpretations but what a what I Will say their their um wants\nThe particular financing and stuff is in place than the development agreement and the transfer the transfer to the convention\nCenter a to A L K ... that's when that that portion happens so right now I'm until then um we still have to continue to do too so\nIt's just open because the trigger was the deal closes entitled transfers when there is certain certain\nThings needed to be ... so I don't want to get into all of that stuff because uh there may be some differentiation interpretations based upon uh um the legal folks that will be a dealing with this um so I you know I don't want to get into that interpretation also\nLet me ask you this because this has nothing to do with legal interpretations were you surprised at the public response that L K Mr Leslie's company sent out\nA was I aware that it was going to be a uh uh I wasn't aware of who's going to be that that was going to be sent\nWere you disappointed by the public discussion from their standpoint you know I I've just people see\nThings particular ways to do I want to see 'em things end up in the newspaper about the city of Waterloo that are the negative no\nUm so but you know I'm not pointing a point a finger at anybody or the lawyers will take care of the conversation I'm going to stay out of that particular portion of it\nAre my public comments will remain the same um the people of this community want to see a brilliant convention center and that's that's that's what we've been trying to work towards that and that's been the\nThe ultimate goal to see those repair see it continue and grow and thrive in and be incredible I just left um another community during the Iowa league of cities conference and guess where we were at\nWe were at a an incredible convention center\nWith amenities and opportunities in some of the same things that we're hoping and still hoping that we can have for the city of Waterloo uh right across the street from K ... so that that's my optimism I'm that's what a citizens have asked me to do [noise]\nUm so that's what we try to do so I'm I'm I'm hoping that that is going to happen\nMy personal sense is that it is not uncommon\nFor there to be snags along the way in any sort of a situation whether it is to private individuals or entities whether it is a municipality like the city of Waterloo in a private individual the fact that there are bumps along the way\nAlmost to the point of again sort of a big public declaration if you will [noise]\nThat's not certainly unprecedented it's probably more common than folks might think you're still optimistic that this deal is going to happen\nI I Am I Am optimistic that the city of Waterloo is going to have a great\nConvention center that's going to continue to attract um local state and national opportunities that that has been my goal or whether it's with uh this particular developer another one\nThat's what people want that's that has been the focus what we're trying to do um but you know overall about anything\nOr if you're the mayor for the city if you're a citizen and you care about the city you do not like to see anything negative in the news we can get ... we can't hide from the reality is that we face every day but we\nDon't I don't I don't like seeing negative things but um that's all the all the part of the job and and we've had\nA myriad of more positive opportunities over a hundred and eighty million dollars of local investment as come down to our downtown Waterloo four to five hundred people living here so Ah yes this is an elephant in the room but let's not forget\n'em there's two to three hundred different um opportunities whether is development whether it's projects whether its support\nThat comes through the city of Waterloo and I'm proud to continue stand on that and anything that uh does not go the way we plan or may not go the way we plan I stand on that too\nUh always said the biggest room is a room we have for improvement so you know if there are those that are sitting clapping your hands about something not going correct for the city of Waterloo and and our citizens and our development\nWell you know ... enjoy your enjoy your moment other son but the fact of the matter is a I Am committed to this job wholeheartedly and give everything I can uh along with so many hardworking people here to make sure we have great opportunities so those can clapped their hands\nBut the rest of us are going to keep rolling up our sleeves and getting busy and making great things happen for the city of Waterloo and that's that's what I stand on\nAnd I'm Glad you mentioned the other development because one of the things I wanted to mention and it's no secret to the audience typically I come into work on highway sixty three [laughter] underwear Waterloo right the development there around Alan hospital or from everything\nOn highway sixty three were Waterloo right the development there around down one hospital a from everything from a couple of different a multi purpose facilities to a new convenience store et cetera that area is really taking shape\nAnd it hasn't been that long that I recall people talking about\nWe can never do anything there that you might as well give up their the I don't think that in that part of town nobody will invest money that is really feeling in ... in a in a way that I'm not sure many people expected they may have been optimistic but may not have expected to talk of the doubt what that's done for that part of town and\nIt's kind of a similar situation to what people said about downtown ten and Fifteen Years ago and there is nothing of value nothing good word no one would ever want to move to a place like that and you know working with a stroke so and working with wireless community schools unity point\nUm it it has ... has really grown to be something else standing and we just saw\nThere was a doctor's office is thinking about building a ten thousand square foot facility with an additional\nTen thousand square foot that may be added All right in front of Carver school a brand new school so imagine what type of partnerships or imagined that the young people can walk out of that school and see uh this medical facility maybe they can dream to become that\nBut this is all this is when you change the mindset\nAnd you know you you think about what positive can happen you know this is what can take place and so I'm I'm proud of it um so and it's that's more yet to come a that is just to begin to go to the other end of the court or sixty three you know go to some of the projects that we have coming up we're not\nWe're not even ... park there anymore not you know what kind of a huge deal I kinda miss no I'm just sweat\nWide it empty belly shirts you know you think about\nThe young blow you think about the struggles you think about the dogs do you think about the notes as you think about\nThere's so many people are in this community that build here because they believe in this place\nAnd that is something that's always encouraging to me um I just left me yesterday I was at the habitat for humanity is um building builders circle breakfast and they're talking about you're seeing the stories about the impact\nThat a house how home ownership has on people and change in their lives and lifting them up from a economically challenged a great situations but there that those those are the many examples that we have that are just incredible uh throughout this community\nUm you know you know the other day a couple of days ago we had a little bit of a water that they got rid of that bag I ah yeah so I'll I'll Wait to our way to you too we get to that point but incredible people\nWasn't hurt is the mayor of the city of Waterloo I Do want to talk a bit about flooding and what the city can and can't do with Mother Nature as we continue our monthly conversation with the mayor here on news talked Fifteen\nAlready taking steps but I think to home down on particular ones like one thing that we've been looking at it as we had our footing drain program\nAnd the thought was that in areas service air is Fifteen and sixteen that was eighty to Ninety percent of our problems\nWell now we're doing the moderately hydraulic modeling with things that are taking place and that may need to not go to this area it may need to go to another area or maybe it may need to be in a concentrated\nArea so it is finding finding those hot spots so every time somebody calls into our\nUm St ... department to um waste management we document every piece and we go and take a look to see exactly what problem there have so when we get that map\nAnd we take a look at that map and say okay this is what we need to use this is where we need to go so it is a challenge for citizens no doubt those that are impacted\nUm but those folks that I talked to they know for a fact uh this is a little bit more than lip service that we are going to work to to solve those problems so we just want to put it in the right place to bring the best amount of benefit to folks\nMary thanks as always for the time we'll talk again next month thank you for having me once an art is the mayor of the city of ...\nWade Brian thanks for being with us thanks for having us who's involved this year in the student food drive what schools are participating

food bank um we have some pizza for the kids and we have some games are and then we have some food bank trivia questions kind of about hunger in our communities and uh\nThen we just kinda go throughout the night a couple of hours a week in the back and forth and then the\nWinner of the night really gets a hundred dollars that kind of kicks off\nThe six week students food drive competition and what they can do as a hundred dollars is up to them but I mean primarily it's used for\nUm whatever events the daily facilitating throughout this next six weeks so uh we used to do strictly food right but in the kind of changing landscape of how we're able to access viewed um we've found that\nOnce we gave them the opportunity to just start fundraising as well\nWhich was last year was the

Williams has been off to a great star but he's a completely different kind of back\nBut a hill is a combination of speed in power that's a hard topic and they get him going in that ground game and they're going to give it to him Fifteen twenty times at least and then they're going to try to beat you over the top of the deep throw in Iowa State has to try to slow down that run game really kind of bottle him up somehow\nUm and not let him get a lot of space and at the same time take away the play offs and stuff so it's a tall task but you're not going to see Oklahoma State thinking dunk alive they're not going to do a lot of stuff down the middle of the field and and short it it's going to be all or nothing they're looking for home runs\nJohn you mentioned justice hill Chris William tweet out Monday that he's running for five hundred Seventy seven yards so far this season on the other hand I Would sneak defenses only given up four hundred eighty four yards and the ground he says something's gotta give one key for the Iowa sneak defense to slow down just as hell\nYou've got to win those battles up front you know and you're going to probably see mostly a three man front for Iowa State Ken those three guys at least given the backfield not necessarily make the tackle but but can re Lima when his battles that the line of scrimmage where he gets into the backfield\nBlow some place up forces things outside where you've got very good tackling defensive backs for our state I think can be looked at the strength for this team or the tackling ability of Florence white gray guys worth\nBraxton Lewis is having a really really good year Brian PV Andy Andre painter excellent tax lawyers and and the you're outside linebacker spears and Harvey are excellent ... attackers as well so uh when I was states defenses at its best re Lima is the guy that's causing it all to happen he's the one who's creating\nThe inability for teams to run the ball where they want to run it\nIt pushes plays a horizontally and then all of a sudden you see those defensive backs on the line backers come flying up and make plays and that's what I said has to do I think to slow down hill um and it's got to be eleven guys to the ball it can't just be one or two or they're going to have to gang tackling\nUm but everybody's going to have to stay in their lanes and do their job too so I mean it I was states really going to have to be on point defensively in this game\nAnd we've seen the last three years Oklahoma State Iowa State games you know just like the the last two TCU games have been low scoring defense of battles\nI always stayed Oklahoma State games have been the opposite they've been in the thirties Oklahoma states rallied from double digits down each of the last three years to beat Iowa State they've been incredible games they've all come down to the last possession but Oklahoma St Lois found a way to win it and uh I was hoping to turn the tables and get one of those when this week but\nYou know you're probably going to give up some points in this game it's not going to be defensively perfect uh you're probably going to give up some points you're going to have would have to find a way to score some points as well because\nEven if you limit Oklahoma State to two big place instead of the four or five that they normally\nProbably going to give up some points you're going to have would have to find a way to score some points as well because even if you limit Oklahoma State to two big place instead of four or five that they normally make 'em there's still a big place and then there's still going to probably put some points on the board and I was states often just going to have to ... uh you know match serve a against Oklahoma State this week\nTrying to go and get that first rolled one of the year to John how important would it be to to to take care of that business on the road and and get that first row W\nI'd be big you know a year ago I was state when five and two on the road they were really good on the road and I think coach gamble likes taking his team on the road and\nThe thing about the way the schedule set up you know this game's played and then for the final six bribery state or at home ... only two more road opportunities after this [noise] um but when you start thinking about can Iowa State get on a run and still have the kind of season that people were hoping for they absolutely can\nUh if they could find a way to win at Oklahoma State especially now you come home with momentum for Saturday Night game against West Virginia jak trace stadium would be absolutely rocking for that one next Saturday and after that\nYou know the schedule I wouldn't say it softens but at least you're not playing a rated team or every week like I said has been and so um you know I I think there is a really good opportunity to make a big time run in this program\nAnd I I think we've seen enough things to know that it's possible this year because your defense is going to keep you in every single game and so uh going on the road getting one in Stillwater a place where I was state hasn't won since two thousand that would be absolutely huge to get this season turned and to get a ... in a positive direction\nAnd with that said if that doesn't happen if you don't go be the top twenty five team on the road on Saturday when you look at the rest of that schedule and I know the team looks at at one game of the time but we can we can look at the whole a body of work that's left you still feel good about this this cycling team getting to\nTo six or seven wins on the year\nYou know I I Do Gary and I tend to be an optimist but I'm the one thing you worry about in that scenario is if they get paid at Oklahoma State and I come back at one and for you got a very talented top ten West Virginia team coming in the following week\nYou know if you can't find a way to win that one does it shake your confidence you know that um you know you're not winning and and\nUm as good as a team is as good as a team knows it is internally you still got to have that result to make you feel that confidence and I I think you know you got to get some and the W. column here pretty soon get some things going off in some way to give the whole team of spark\nUm if those things happen absolutely uh you know I Know the coaches and players they they believe in themselves is not that they don't it's just that uh you know you you got to see that ... that reward at the end of the string every once in awhile to keep going\nYeah good point and we've seen it where it in any sport uh the the momentum of winning uh certainly uh can get you on a roll and also that that where you just can't get over the hump and get wins that can kind of snowball on you too can it\nCan and I I think a great example that us look at the NC double a basketball tournament and when you see a school that is a smaller school that's playing in a conference where they dominated play\nBut they're used to winning and then you see that team go in there and as a uh Thirteen\nA you know a a higher ranked opponent higher seat and the NC double a tournament we see it happen all the time and I think it's a result of a team that she used to winning every single game and they just get in that mindset that they're going to find a way to do that\nAnd um I think winning does breed winning and losing sometimes does breed losing you know it's it's a slippery slope sometime the other way too so you got to find a way to kind of internal eight get that stuff's shifted than\nOne when can be the spark it really can be a a huge sparked a changing your entire season and I think back to last year he do I wish they went into October to ensue and the chicken park situation that just happened\nThey went into Oklahoma's thirty three point underdogs nobody in the world was given I was state a chance to win that first came in October last year and look what happened you know they went foreign on October and I had a great great season then hopefully October's is good I always stayed this years it was last year\nGreat stuff as always call went on Saturday and now we'll talk about it next week at this time John thanks for joining us\nYet thanks thanks for having me\nJohn Walters on her village in the I. P. hotline talking Iowa State cycling football as they take on twenty fifth rank Oklahoma State in Stillwater this Saturday again to thirty kicked off for the cycle and speaking of a two thirty kick off\nThat's when I was in Minnesota lock horns in Minneapolis\nA were stay with us because it about four thirty five or four forty today we'll talk about that game with my grandma the play by play voice of the gold and go first back with more of the show live from the old pi you after this Gary\n... when it comes to my banking needs I go to Lincoln savings bank they handle all my personal banking along with my business banking needs for on press role in my senior valley court kings basketball team\nA a good friend of ours from Manchester, Iowa less Delaware high school and now the play by play voice of the Minnesota golden golfers radio network might grim joining us on our village in the I. P. hotline he's in the twin cities\nIn Minneapolis and yes he sexy any knows it welcome to the show Mike how're you doing my ...\nA a good to talk with you Gary are going great go it's a little chilly here uh I I Am at my daughter's tennis match I had to actually thankful ends I sneaked inside the high school here so I could warm up a little bit like forty degrees outside and I I made a tactical error wearing shorts to this thing I can tell you that\n[laughter] I talk about this Minnesota golden golf first team PJ flack year leader trying to get that program rarely rocking and rolling got up to a great start in non conference play but then a two weeks ago had that loss at Maryland\nForty two to Thirteen a bit of a set back there I got to believe but what ... what are things looking like Bert gold and goal for his foot ball right now well right now\nThey have to tape the long view a little bit they're still very young\nUm their plane I mean they they have thirty two or thirty three freshmen on the to Detroit now um they have only nine seniors um that are on scholarship that are on a you know the regular ... special things other kicker is a senior he's all big tent gel every one of the strength of the team\nUm and one of those guys got hurt and Rodney Smith who was the number one running back on this team and he uh he tore his ACL and he's out for the season in week two and then they go for his best defensive player Antwon Winfield junior certainly a pro football fans would recognize his dad's name Antwon Winfield and he was easily their best player maker on defense\nTo use a defensive player the week and the Big Ten in week two and special teams play or the week in the Big Ten in week one Andy in weeks for he uh uh had a foot injury which will end his sees anyone underwent surgery last week so their best all sense of players out their best defensive players out so they even get younger\nUh and so I think they had to take a long view they do have a lot of talented young kids but I think they're still a couple of years away from what I Would say like going into this game this weekend they're going to have to have some breaks to win to beat Iowa\nI'm and I think in a ... ... you know there are a couple of years away from going into a game against ... Iowa Wisconsin or somebody like that saying hey you know we play a game we can win it or they they are going to need some breaks to win and I think there are a couple of years away from that but I Do like the talent level that that that he has he's recruited a high level here in the first two years\nHow much do you think they have they can they change or do they adjuster do differently that maybe you've seen out of him in the first four games coming off of by weak and\nMaybe because of who the opponent is maybe not but just how much can they can they make changes in and try and throw something different at Iowa this Saturday\nWell I think they're going to ... it will probably not be strategically I think they're they're set with how they want to run their offense and defense and and the PGA select has talked about that now that doesn't mean he's going to put guys in spots that they can't succeed but I think he\nFeels like he's recruited enough people in two years that that that his system I think he struggled with that a little bit last year and that\nUm he wanted to and ... you know you want to implement your system so the cultures there and the and the guys understand it but\nUh you know there are some players weren't exactly you know ... what he wanted the new they certainly ... what the previous coaching staff wanted to do but you know that's what makes it coaching change a little bit difficult at times um I think he feels good about you know what they want to do on up and some deep and now the personnel just asked again experience so I don't think they're going to change much now they may change some personnel\nUm they they do have some depth that cornerback\nUm and I would not be surprised to see a couple of quarterbacks moved to safety to help his Winfield was a safety um I I Would see maybe one of those experience guys a move over to say right now in there to date they have a true freshmen listed a walk on it that\nAre just starting place it Winfield but I Would think that he'll get some help from some older guys who are also quarterbacks I think you'll see you know you can see some of that but I'll be honest I think strategically they're set and what they want to do and um you know if they have to take their lumps while installing that system or they may do that\nMike you're absolutely right sometimes when you get a new coach it does take a little time we sure scene that are in Ames, Iowa for sure you know we talk about PTA flat keep brings a ton of energy to a football program it worked at western Michigan how we're go for fans reacting to the ... said he came to pass\nIt's a great question you know the die hard love it\nUh you know and any you know they're going to support pretty much any coach uh it it is a unique market I think Gary you and I have talked about this before and the pro sports town where there's two major newspapers to major sports radio stations you know and now in the world of Twitter and message boards and everything else there's a lot of experts out there that have opinions and\nSo it it's a cynical market here uh because of the pro sports and that kind of stuff and I think that has surprised PJ a little bit\nComing from or where you know he was a grad assistant at Ohio State he played at northern Illinois which is a college town a coached at western Michigan a college town and I think that has surprised him a little bit the cynicism that the ... and there's been some negativity and you know he is a positive guy I'll say this being around the program\nOr he is exactly who he is like I think there's some people who think he's got some ... or it's you know this is a a fake front behind a guy that's you know you know trying to\nRise up the coaching totem pole well he certainly trying to rise in the ... range but what he does it's all substance I mean everything he talks about he implements\nA he requires players do certain things that other coaches don't in terms of uh you know community service in terms of how they have to I mean he uh Gary ... he makes his players sit in the first two rows of class they they can't sit in the back\nCannot wear T shirt got to wear a shirt with a collar so he distributes a team issued a polo shirts that they weren't a class can't wear a hat\nAnd he sends a student managers on random checks to make sure and if you don't follow the rule and they had a a running back do this two weeks ago second week of school um they did their random checks that are running back was wearing a T shirt not a collared shirt\nYou had to wear a suit to class for a week and so I mean if it's you know if you're if you're not a substance or you're\nA fraud or your phone or you're not going to go to those links to try to implement what you're doing so I'm a you know you might say hey that's Sally why you're worrying about that let's worry about beating Iowa this weekend but uh he is so sincere about hey I'm not just a football coach I Want to you know educate these guys I Want them to learn how to behave I Want them you know help them grow it\nBut uh he is so sincere about hey I'm not just a football coach I Want to you know educate these guys I Want them to learn how to behave I Want them you know help them\nGrow as human beings in this you know when you see a college roster of a hundred and whatever ah there's so many kids come from different backgrounds some come from rich some come from a dirt poor some uh you know come from Christianity summer moslems I mean it's amazing and so he's trying to help build\nA culture that will make your kids\nMight Graham the play by play voice of the Minnesota golden golfers radio network on her village in VIP hotline as he prepares to call Minnesota football on Saturday on their radio network\nAnd a homecoming game for the golden golfers as they host the ... and a two thirty kick off it as a ... he hasn't been there long as the ban evidently some talkers some pressure from some of the fanatics about you know thinking that it that the one last record\nWould be better at this time because the in a recent article coach flat came out and set of people think you take a pill and you can automatically when you need to look around the country basically saying\nLook at what happens to other coaches going in trying to take over a program that had been struggling when a person took it over and he just is it getting the message out there that hey you know slow down a little bit we're going to get there\nBut it's going to take some time give us some ...\nYeah that's exactly the messenger there's no doubt and I'm now he didn't name any names but when you think about it you look at what's happening in order to state which has been a long\nLong you know of traditional power and with the first year coach they're not getting\nA I mean eventually that guy might win there I don't know probably will write with all the resources but I think his point\nIs is when you have a new coach and sometimes of pieces don't fit with your system is um sometimes players don't understand what you want your in essence he he has talked about this in essence in a first year everyone's are freshmen seniors that have been there for four years or have learned everything they need to know from another coach\nNow you come in and change a bunch of stuff they're basically freshmen again and and and that's hard and now\nUh you know you bring in another twenty freshmen and uh guys are are are moving along and trying to figure out what they're where they're supposed to even be early part of practice or you know in the fall camp a Nebraska you know first year coach maybe that guy's going to win there but right now with the change and culture and everything else it it isn't the you know they they haven't won a game yet\nOr I you know there's other places I'm not trying to pick on anybody but that that's because some of the point that he's he's making that uh it takes a minute and\nThe interesting thing here is Tracy clays was from the jury kill or you know from the jury kill family tree and they won nine games the year before and I think a lot of people look at that and say man they went from nine wins and then they let Tracy go\nAnd PJ but came back and won five games or what happened and you know they didn't know that you know it would be it was going to be interesting to see what they were going to do ahead Tracy stayed but they didn't have the quarterback position solved and they really struggled deposition last year and now because of that they're starting a true freshman this year so they're going to struggle a little bit of the kids got great talent and great armed but\nUh it's hard to win Big Ten games with a guy that's playing in the ... game ever you know and that it did not have the benefit of a red shirt year to learn\n'em and and so those are some of the growing pains that a new coaches or have to go through and I'm a you know and then some guys are left because of the coaching change and then remember the\nBasic reason for the coaching change was back with that fiasco when the team\nBoycotted the ballgame for awhile five guys including what we're going to be three stars in the defense of secondary got expelled from school so all of a sudden he had to fill those kind of holes as well so it wasn't as if it's he has he inherited the nine one team but I don't know if that she was going to come back and win nine the next year\nPaid for by plump for Congress\n\nBack in the ... the other place on university avenue in

his call in show to the home game on Saturday hosting North Dakota state steep speaking of North Dakota state\nLet's bring in Jeff's call hey he is the play by play voice of the north Dakota state radio network he's on her village in VIP hotline we'd go live the Fargo how you doing Jeff\nGary always a pleasure Hungary and my friend\nI'm good I'm looking forward to this one on Saturday I tell you the more I look at you guys in study I mean it just looks like another championship caliber team that coach Kleiman has assembled this year at North Dakota state maybe a few different numbers here or there but\nIt looks like the same teams we've been watching for the last seven years that have won six of the last seven national championships\nWell Gary it's it's definitely a veteran team once again twenty five seniors are on the squad this year and a lot of returning experience from guys that have played a lot of games and it played in a lot of big games including\nA playoff matchups that of course a lot of those uh young men of had the opportunity to play in the national championship game down at 'frisco are as well so\nUh I think that's that's where you start with this team and um you you got to a lot of peace to the puzzle returning a lot of ah a confidence there obviously and you know of course climate talks a lot about uh the culture of this program and how\nUh it it starts at the top obviously a the leadership begins with him\nWhat does northern Iowa due to a settling done where he's comfortable and able to make a few throws at flights of confidence in the passing game early and often I think that will be an interesting uh chess piece to watching this contest\nWe know that North Dakota state has got a great defense or a really good often ... by eastern stick in the running backs Anderson and Don\n... in your first four games has there been out a little bit of a weakness or a chink in the arm or if you will that maybe still a bit of a concern with this particular Chris climbing team [noise]\nYou know I Would say wide receiver ... has been a a question mark for a scary a dairy a shepherd is a senior or he returned she has had a very good year by the way coming off\nOf a career best one hundred and eight seniors receiving against South Dakota state last weekend but he caught five of the nine receptions out of the hand of eastern ... so\nYou know with the passing game the pies and do a great job asked order Iowa with Riley more to life this and other corporate in or the tide instead of the passing game and ... and obviously as you guys know this is a big role from the the running back spot and winds up in different places in the throwing game as well\nOther pies and will pass the football to their running back out of the backfield especially in the red zone area so I think NDSU does a good job of trying to maybe a mask that concern\nTo a certain degree and they do or you can stick those are very solid job of distributing the football to a lot of different wide receivers you know when the special teams side or working in a new hunter or working in a new long snapper\nAnd also and do a whole er which is a little thing you don't think about a whole lot but you had a three veteran guys in those positions the last couple of years for North Dakota state so it's their first road trip away from the friendly confines of a cargo dome so the noise and a different environment affect those guys there's something also to see\nIs it a healthy North Dakota state team coming in on Saturday\nI tell you what Gary knock on wood this is about as healthy as that the ASU has been in my time here we've always last uh two or three key players\nTo a season ending injury it seems like at this point in time and the season but knock on wood uh we have not had to deal with a whole lot of that so far this season and the right now it's a a a injury was this team is doing about as well as you can hope first month\nOr when you look at your deep and how big is it been to get Greg ... back this year\nIt's been huge I mean you lose him day too and he's a prime example of of players that went down to season\nWell it's been huge I mean you lose him day too and he's a prime example of of players that went down to a\nSeason ending injuries a year ago that happened in the second day of fall camp last season and uh it's it's been great to have a back nobody has skipped to beat a right now he you just you talk about him in the backfield constantly he has an uncanny ability\nTo time the snap and get off just a a half second quicker than everybody else does without\nGetting himself call for all sides so\nHe's got an uncanny ability to do that is speed is athleticism off the edge faking it extremely difficult defender to block especially when he picks his ears back in passing situations it's been it's been big to have him back in\nYou know when he went down there obviously hurt but first climate said that was going to be the number one the store and the recruiting class of twenty Ninety four NDSU football\nJeff the price and fans always seem to travel very well especially to the unit don't what is this the year where we might get lucky and we see about two hundred of 'em in the unit don't\n[laughter] I I don't think so there is I think we're going to see\nProbably the normal amount of green and yellow are making their way behind the NDSU side lights are down to in Cedar falls or they love coming down I mean they loved the tailgating atmosphere\nOutside the unit don't uh they love good football and I think they they definitely appreciates what northern Iowa football is all about it so it's a it's a rivalry type of steel as we've talked about\nIt's a big time football game and uh went by and fans had the chance to travel this year ... they're going to they're going to hit the hit the road and get the the trailers down there and the RVs that had come down and not expect them to probably\nCome down and droves on Saturday afternoon [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm not sure there's a better or not only Missouri Valley football conference team but ... team of fans that travel than ah than this North Dakota state program bait travel in droves in big numbers it'd be\nDo you think there'll be a thousand Fifteen hundred could there be two thousand vice and fans this Saturday at end of the dome or will it not be that many\nI I think that's possible um you know I I Would I Would bet you would see at least a thousand Gary a lens that's definitely a possibility um as far as two thousand does I don't want to sit here and say oh yeah it's gonna happen I you know I'm not sure but if it wasn't shocked me uh when North Dakota state went\nTo kick stadium back in two thousand sixteen I Want to say there was around\nEight to ten thousand ... found their way out in the ... stadium that day was that the issue was fortunate enough to win a twenty three to Twenty one and twenty sixteen so I Would not be shocked if we saw a thousand a Fifteen hundred two thousand MPs fit there at one o'clock Saturday afternoon [noise]\nI Want to wrap it up with this ... and it's all it's not really an easier fair question to compare teams but I just like to get your thought on you calling a all their games a year ago when they won the national championship the year before that they\nThey got beat in the semi finals of the year before that they win at all what it when you look at this particular North Dakota state team\nHow do you how do they compare to the to the recent championship teams that North Dakota state has had\nWell I'll I'll compare them to last year because I think that's that's the best for me there's a lot of people around here that you know the the the benchmark program I guess at North Dakota state in the division one era\nIs the two thousand Thirteen team that went Fifteen and no one the national championship played a great game in the regular season that year as you guys were bumper up here versus northern Iowa\nOr in one late in the sand little jury\nTouchdown run a B Kansas State destructive so that that's kind of the bench mark\nA division one team at NDSU and [noise] you know I think that's a little bit of an unfair to this group that two thousand thirteenth team had\nGosh guys I think four or five pros on it that you're making more or at least I got looks in camps in at some of those guys are still playing\nIn the NFL so that twenty Thirteen theme was pretty darn good that to read the table and won the national championship game I think the thing that I Would say comparing at least at this point of this year's version is to last year's version\nIs it's a little bit more experienced and I think there's a there's a little bit more depth\nUh with this group especially a up front on the offensive and defensive lines um I I think there are a lot of comparisons that you can make and say that\nThe twenty seventeenth a team last year very similar to the twenty eighth team team a lot of those guys are are back on this year's team for North Dakota state so I I think I Would say it's a little bit more experience and a little bit deeper uh as far as the number of players that get in and their versatility for this group was NDSU\nThat's scary for the rest of the valley and all of that yes football but uh\nUh you know best good stuff Jeff has always really appreciate the extended time on our show today we'll talk with you on Saturday ... in the press box at the unique don't prior to a a kick off of that the that great matchups between these two

coaching change they kind of pulled his offer and he didn't mince words when when they came to the unit don't backing twenty sixteen but isn't it safe to say that this is a rivalry\nOr is definitely a rivalry you know and I think coach climate and talk about that on his weekly press conference about how you know when they're in Kansas City or in St Louis Minneapolis are all those places they

watch the football games all season long on the panther sports network presented by Casey general stores log on to you and I paid ... dot com to find TV stations\nNear you coach I wanted to play that clip because a guy we haven't really talked much about is your place kicker Austin earth um he is some big field goals in the win last Thursday and a nice job is your is your place kicker this year I don't want to jinx seem I Hope we need a big deal out of him Saturday but\nHe's been hitting kicks for your all season long\nWell he's worked hard to summer and I mean he he really has applied himself he's a soccer player transferred from Drake originally couple of years ago\nI found them by email I just got an email from even that's how he ends up being a kicker years later but at the same time\nHe is really committed himself to to be in a gray kicker very competitive young man and there's really doing a nice job and he's sitting there during the day student teaching down in the dike he goes to take every day actually it's a practice late because he doesn't go school 'til three so we got kind of had to move around are kicking times because you know he's got to finish up of teaching to these cars he'll graduate in December\n[noise] gets up um talk more about the match up on Saturday you when you look back at the game a year ago at their place it was a game you literally seven did not think it was tied at seven at the half\nThey ended up winning it thirty to fourteen North Dakota state did when you look back at that game they got a lot of guys back twenty five seniors on their team do you feel like it's ... for the most part it's pretty much\nThe team that you faced a year ago in there don't\nYeah I'm sure it is it I mean I don't look into the seniors and all that type of stuff that you know you just told me I did notice all the players that look the same as last year I mean they got a very good football players ... hours doing a great job for them and\nAnd and you know stick as is laying there there are a fence and minard leave their defense and so yeah there there are well coaster well play they play hard you know there there's a reason they're good [noise]\nWhat else about this matchup when when you uh get prepared to host North Dakota state can you share with us from from your side of\nIt well from our side of it is it's\nYou know everybody everybody gets wound up being who you're playing and this is the same thing we do every week is is every team we play is number one\nUh to the fans is is the number one in the papers but but you know but every time we play Indiana State was number one last week as far as we were concerned because we're just trying to win that down when that play when that day and and uh fortunately did so now in a position to go into this game and we get to play it at home\nSo uh I guess I've just understanding now that this is their first wrote game\nAnd you know I thought everybody would ban the road by now but ah but yeah so we're excited to get back home parks I'd see what happens in our players I'll be ready to\nPlay ... and just a second home game for you this is your your fifth game of the year but only the second time you've been able to play the inside the unique don't\nYeah and that's you know that's that you know you look at some of the other teams in the in the lake and and a lot of these guys are are getting a lot of home games right now so things will always bounce out once you get back to the lake play and\nAnd these these schedules have been set forever as far as a week when you play and and and you know their schedule of two thousand twenty two right now as far as yours the elite schedule it should not conference schedule that that the school has control of\nIt I Know the uh you you prepare hard and break down every team do you feel like in this match up\nOr you have a little more familiarity with your opponent just because I mean there's some former un I guys they're they've been there for a while does does that help at all as you\nPrepare your game plan and stuff like you feel that they're really really good at what they do at North Dakota state but do you feel like at least going into the game feel like you've got a pretty good handle on on what they're going to try and do both on ... defensively\n[noise] I think you know what they're going to do but I think they dress it up enough where it's hard to\nSee in in the game itself and I think that's the trick in the trade is you know they dress up as motion was shifts with adjustments they just they dress up their defense well with the with the walk round safeties and moving people around so they do a good job in disguise\nWhat they do but then when you go watch film it doesn't seem like they're they're doing a lot of things but when you get on the field and you really watch and the and the speed they do it that much difference so I think that's what it it may be\nHard for a player you know when when I tell you can't you got to get in the game to figure out against the look like and that this one of those games that you know they'll have to there'll be a couple of series is down to figure out just how fast this game's going to roll cause this this will be one of those games that has that kind of temperament to her [noise]\nAh also it when you when you look at this match up just following their game last week against South Dakota state it seemed like they there were times they really came after tearing Christian is is this a team that likes to\nThat likes the blitz maybe a little bit more than some other teams do a with their defense or because they feel confident maybe what they've got on the back into that defense in in past coverage\nI think I think there's something to be said for that they're they're they're confident their coverage but they're confident their confidence across the board they're very confident football team so everybody is the kicker confidence so ah they'll come in here with all expectation of of uh of being successful and and uh and then we'll go from there [noise] uh\nThis this also asked if you like a game that down in the trenches both sides of the football for your team will be yeah I Know you talked about that coming off the Iowa game that you felt like the defense the blind didn't perform\nUp to what what they felt they could and then the defensive lines been outstanding the last couple of games that it just doesn't feel like this will be a game that\nRight down the line of scrimmage your that I'm going to be it's going to be a man's game right down in that part of the game I think\nThat's when I listen to what they're coached upset and kind of follow them a little bit you know what\nWhat gets said about this game by most people watch had washed his game on the air is this is kind of the [noise] you know that really tough game if you will that really power struggle game where we're guys are getting after it on the field so I'm sure they're listening right now just like we listen to them so you know this this will be a ... that\nIf you will that really power struggle game where where guys are getting after it on the field so I'm sure they're listening right now just like we listen to them so you know this this will be this way of all respect in the world for 'em and and uh those guys do a nice job they do a good job coach and they do the job playing and like you said they get twenty five seniors well", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "04"}
