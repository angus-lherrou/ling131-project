under criticism from the same people who are involved in criticizing our president who's had no role whatsoever of this so that means you use it to attack him the media use it to attack conservatives\nI think I read some way or the or the pro Saudi conservatives who the hell the pro Saudi conservatives somehow\nI wound up in that group Mr produce if I ever said anything that makes me a pro Saudi anything\n\nI said nothing the last two weeks I wasn't on the air\nThe media are diabolical their disgraceful\nI don't know of anyone that's possible who's making any excuses for what the Saudi regime which isn't incest us throwback\nRegime I don't know anybody who's making any excuses for the brutal assassination\nOf this journalist but what people are asking is about the coverage\n\nOn the one hand it's non stop on the other hand or they're reporting everything about the gentleman who was murdered\nYou're not allowed to ask and he by the way while you're out of don't ask about climate change not you can't ask don't ask about anything\n\nYeah there are legitimate policy questions we debate those\nIs the president right when he says I'm not going to forfeit a hundred and ten billion dollar purchase of American military armaments which the Chinese or the Russians would sell otherwise why is that that controversial statement\n\nThe purpose of that cell is the benefit us if it purely benefited the Saudis that would be one thing but it benefits America\n\nI mean as I said earlier in the proud of what the hell we open an embassy in Cuba it's a police state that torture isn't murders\n\nPresident's been attacked because of his heart policies on China\nI told you Iran has one of the highest execution rates in the world China has\nThe highest execution right in the world as the Tibetans\n\nAsked the other religious minorities in China ask any of the political dissidents how they're treated in China\n\nAnd these aren't real trials that take place in China at all [noise] All right so what should we knew\n\nWhat should we do\nThese are legitimate questions that ought to be engaged discuss\nPolicy thoughtfully considered\nBut who is knee jerk around now the media and all that the president monster that spread it must presidents had Thirteen different positions on this\nIt's a non American citizen in the Saudi consulate Saudi territory within the country of turkey\nWithin the country of turkey\nI despise the Saudi leadership I despise the turkey leadership\nDespise them all\nI despise the turkey leadership despise them all\nBut I Know how dishonest the media are when my name is thrown around when I'm off the air for two weeks as I said something which I didn't is if somebody if see our TV who said something is monitored are managed by me which he's not [noise]\nThatcher media socks [noise]\nAnd I'm not involved in any whispering campaigns I have a microphone for God's sake say half million people can you hear what I say

what we talk\nRadio is not free to just spend all its time partnering with the political party or something like that [noise] so that's an impossibility [noise] and what I'm saying here is\nWe have millions and millions of people listening to this ... let's let's pretend right now five million people and listen [noise] if all of you listening to me right now make sure that\nFive or six people vote on election day we will have a massive landslide I thought no thanks for your call I don't know what he's rambling on about talk radio partnering with somebody or other\nParts of let me explain talk radio talk radio is not this\nYou know it's not it's not the um hit this isn't the wizard of Oz were behind the curtain there's talk radio and there was Mr Big and all the rest of it and and there's the person behind talk radio talk radio his hundreds if not thousands of local regional and national hosts\nThe vast majority of whom don't know each other they're owned by different businesses different companies that have different affiliates so it's not like hey talk radio let's all get together and work with so and so it doesn't work that way\nSo it's not rational to begin with that's number one number two if that's what we did then we wouldn't be talk radio anymore we'd be GOP radio I don't want to be GOP radio\nMy whole point in the first hour as this is an election about us you need to go out and vote trauma partnering with this winter that one each and every one of us has power each and every one of us has power\nLet's just do things differently this election day you take it upon yourself to make sure that four five six or whatever the number of individuals in your circle family circle church or synagogue circle your employment circle\nFamily circle and like I said that the one that's all\nAnd we will swamp them they won't know what the hell it's very it's not complicated very simple\n\nNot complicated at all Jay Bakersfield, California the great KFI will go\nYeah uh yeah I I on the whole ... thing and drop by and really the served as the surveys or you know Trump throughout it right has a repair that investigation number one number two I have repeatedly they found that the the Saudi rulers throw out it\nOkay hey buddy on leaning out our on our on a ... you know it's\nLike a farce of all what you're saying is dishonest\nSaid over and over again he wants to know the facts [noise] this is a moving target that's the way it is he wants to know the information he wants to know that you see unlike you and unlike these cheap shot reporters and commentators on TV this president has a country to run and he has to figure out as best as he's able to\nWhat's in the best interest of the United states of America and the citizens of the United states of America so he's not just going to call a talk show or or get on a cable show or or pop off about about this that and the other\nAnd he's here he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off that comes in and as he gets more advice\nAnd he's his he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off that comes in and as he gets more advice on what to do plus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in their staffs involved in that you and I can't even imagine\nSo what do you want them to do you want to say the royal families guilty I Know they're guilty or cutting off all relations with them would that make you happy\nYou know oh I totally agree and uh for a far where you step but the last thing that you just set a second ago you're right it's a mess to ... I don't mind the big point is you know it's not over get information number one\nAnd then make some decisions right but he keeps defending those guys the Saudis they've got a nice guy the the really bad guy they'd do a lot of bad stuff and wave going what he kept the little guys\nWeathers who keep defending those guys\nSpies those guys with the aid maybe if I don't think he's defending those guys I mean again I I've been sort of observing this from afar over the last the period of time since uh since the Turks put out the information that he was murdered [noise]\nI don't see him defending those guys will be defending those guys why did the old man the king step in and take the power back from the sun to try and deal with this situation\nWell you you you know he's already come out several times or he came out with a rogue excuse early on\n... so that's all wrong you know you have no evidence yet okay let me tougher on\nWhy are we so focused on this\nWell because it's important it's the truth\nAbout honestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place a horrible thing that took place but I I hate to say this 'cause I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways but for the United states it's simply not that important I mean giving a hundred and fifty\nBillion dollars to the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me is a big damn deal\n[noise] but you know the media and the lap supported that deal\nObama supported that deal that is a terrorist regime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses this man was Florida that are horrific way great horrible horrible horrible horrible but I don't know why are the coverage\n[noise] is is is so massive and neither do you\nI'm just looking for truth Perrier okay and I don't hear a great\nMan no matter what they say All right thank you sir\nThe truth is the Saudis murder that we know\nAnd do I believe the royal family was involved certainly part of that certainly the crown prince them I Do have a how would they do this without knowing some of them were his right hand one of them was his right hand and when I Believe one of his intelligence centers top forensic guy over there isn't really any doubt about\nThis no there's no doubt about it but we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know but what do you what the president to do\nHe says they're going to be ... to a severe ramifications but he's not cutting off the military\nSo so what else do you want him to do\nI'm quite serious about this I hear that criticism any suggestions what do you want him to do\n\nAnd uh I understand the Washington Post is all worked up about this and so or other media outlets I got I understand it and I understand that people are upset about it I don't like it at all I think it's outrageous I'm no fan of the Saudi regime and I never have been\nBut I'm not talking about any of that talking about the reporting is over the top in the sense that it is nonstop\nAnd there's so many other things going on in this country in the world but at least deserves some attention\n\nI don't know

join the Freedom Caucus is that correct\nYes sir I've already a publicly said that I Would join the Freedom Caucus I've supported Jim Jordan and his race for speaker fundamentally believe that his

trail and you and your listeners know that the failures in Washington stem from their failure to do what they said they would do that is why Trump is successful and why people are proud this ornaments

growth\nWe saw for over eight years really go back even under the Bush administration why we had a decade\nOf economic growth that was on average in you know this is somewhere in the one percent two percent range depending on the year which was causing the continued stagnation what's causing the lack of the ability to bail ability to have the jobs that we need a lack of economic growth which obviously harm to the deficit and debt as well\nAnd now what do we say we're seeing four percent economic growth forcing the United states for the first time at a decade\nLabel is the most competitive nation on earth right we're seeing a jobless claims all time lows but not just for everybody but for groups like Hispanics and black business owners other folks that we're seeing incredible

U. and places like that and those are extremely tough games to win just every once in a while we'll pick one of those off\nBut usually it it it doesn't work out as a W and then\nWe play at an extremely tough MCS opponent or to whether it's eastern Washington Montana or you know teams like that back\nIn the day we're playing McNeese state when they were a\nA really powerful MCS team in their back so there's a there's there's\n... and then we get into the valley and we play North Dakota state early that's a tough game so a lot of it has to do with the fact that we play such a tough schedule it seems like right out of the gate Marty they're just ... we we don't play you know three lower level MCS teams and two of the three at home and and start three you know it just\nIt it just isn't the way our schedules been built over the years\nYeah that makes a lot of sense but still it takes coaching to pull them all together and ... keep them focused and and the\nMarket was a great job with that absolutely of which I just wanted to mention is ah the cycle on play Saturday homecoming on coming and uh\nI didn't realize that uh we've gotten quite the judge or not in October the last couple of years so uh looking for good things to come from this game it's a\nIt's just going to be interesting uh there's gonna be a lot of passing I think uh but uh I think we can get the job done\nGoing to be a good game homecoming always fun to you and I won their homecoming game\nI Will one there's this last Saturday now it's the psych loans turn to take care of homecoming Marty go get a win on Saturday you'll be there right oh of course yeah All right All right German will have John Walters on the show on uh on Thursday and get him to preview that match\nUp with Texas Tech and their homecoming game always enjoyed getting John on\nAbout what time do you suppose that\nMight we get John usually it for all five or ... and on Thursday so tuned in for that gets you know we'll All right Marty thanks a lot yeah good to hear from you appreciate you halfway I marked for at least fifty three and nine in the month of November there to hold on to be there it is right there fifty three and nine\nNot bad real quick in your head a college student um\nAlgebra math advance math expert that as a winning percentage of\nWe'll go to break and then we'll let you figure it out we're back right after the the other place restaurants of the cedar valley have been the sports destination for area fans for over forty years all your favorite games round there numerous TVs and they have the NFL\nSunday ticket old Pete Pete has been voted best of the best every year make\nThe other place your pre and post game headquarters for all your high school and college sporting events they're also a proud sponsor of you and I athletics open seven days a week and eating and drinking establishment the other place restaurants of the cedar valley\nSo is it any more going on [noise] they'll quit smoking or not again you up to what is this the time he tried to quit smoking you know really needs to go to central Iowa vapor it can help them out right away\nCentral Iowa neighbors gang quitting smoking is higher and that's why they\nOh really needs to go to central Iowa vapors it can help them out right away\nCentral Iowa Weber's day gang quitting smoking is hard that's why they often to an extent that line of products that you'll find the perfect parents have nicotine in slavery how you'd take the bus permanently not in central Iowa vapors wandering Cedar Rapids location that the island ... dot com for looking Hindi town and always remember did not smoke vapor\nHey this is the sports guy and voice of the one I pay if there is Gary ... when it comes to my banking needs I go to Lincoln savings bank they handle all my personal bank ... along with my business banking needs for on press rope and my senior valley court kings basketball team whether it's for checking or savings accounts car\nOr personal loans mortgages and more bang for the sports guy dead Lincoln savings bank you'll love the friendly courteous service at all LSD locations throughout Iowa they have online banking to check them out at my L.

South Dakota state during the regular season\nBut South Dakota state had the better year so South Dakota state got a first round by gotta top eight seed you and I wins at home beach\nMonmouth and then has to go on the road and play at South Dakota state\nAnd the Jack rabbits got revenge on the the regular season last to you and I and your seasons over that it's I just if you want to win the national championship\nAnd and that's been North Dakota states playing a that's been their route is to have home games in the playoffs where they've only lost I think one home playoff game and the last seven years the six years that they won national championships\nThey won six of the last seven national championships North Dakota state has in those six national championship runs they played every game at home except on the neutral field for the championship game\nTo very very helpful I mean I Can't imagine the unit dome and in a second round playoff game think about if it's against you know a team like south coast stable or you know a debate team like that I'm getting them in the unit don't would be huge and then if you win staying in the end of don't\nAbsolutely [noise] uh this is coach barley we were talking about injuries earlier and he was asked if if maybe there was a little blessing in disguise with some injuries a couple of weeks ... weeks ago that that in a way force them to go to that three three defense and now they're able to mix up\nBeat fences three three for three lot of different looks coach\nWell Mitt in disguise mail the unintended consequences through the injuries is probably the fact that the more people that are involved the more\n[noise] uh [noise]\nMore team dynamic and and uh that comes together on that because if you're if you're in the battle if you're preparing to play a little bit different than being prepared to be a backup and then when you have success and you're getting into the first series of second series and not wait until the\nThird quarter that also keeps you in the game so the more guys that are into in the game the more intense they hope to play with late in the game so all those things have possibly been an unintended consequence of the injuries and and putting in a\nDifferent defense and I don't want I wouldn't say it's a different defense is just a different personnel through [noise] and uh but yeah they've except for that they play as well and they've had the talent that was part of that process was trying to figure out [noise]\nWhat can we do to you know can they play this defense or their bodies to do their style of play fit and\nWhat can we do to you know can they play this defense or their bodies to their style of play fit it\nIn a dead so it was a good time to put it in a way I Want to use it when it's at the right time to there has got to sit through a fence as well as just can't be played against anybody has got to set the right off so we have something now in our arsenal that's been played and practiced and [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] have confidence and if we need to pull it out we can and can we can always go the Forman three for the [noise]\nWhatever level of them guys out there oh [laughter]\nOh yeah there will be eleven panther defensive players out there just what what look are they going to use are they going to go three three are they going to go there for three or they're going to put by guys up on the line they just they had a lot of different things they can do now after implementing that three three defense a week ago\nAnd then used at some again this past Saturday against South Dakota state oh and you can rotate to defenses as effectively\nAs you and I can't see because it keeps the odd things on their toes they got to be prepared granted a lot of teams can have different fronts but you know personality you got to look at personality you don't know what it's going to come it's not like you and I goes out\nOn a specific drives says okay we're going to play for for no they change multiple down you know it could be first down there three five the next down there for three\nAnd they continue to do that on Saturday in South Dakota state I mean price topless in a defensive on line and left and right and there was awesome is great yeah and when the fence or when South Dakota state would roll a couple of different occupancy guys into the game\nThen you and I get the chance to counter with what and and you'll see the referee stand over the football and not let them quick hike it\nTo try and catch you and I in in a in a defense alignment that they don't want to be in so that's one of the new things and football but if one team if if one team subs than they are going to wait and let the other team I have a chance to to to counter\n... what the other team just sub dance so uh yeah I think having that that that additional defense the front that different look they can throw a ladder and often says is really good uh working on the broadcast up last night for western Illinois leather next like two to run out of a three for defense\nYes and I don't think we've seen a lot of three four this year I think you're right it can be a lot more speed on the field\nFor line backers uh it it always seemed to me like it was a little tougher to run against a three four\nBecause those light you know where the line backers are coming from um those big three uh down Lyman if they can take up the often see blind it let's let's the linebackers run free to to tackle the running backs and running plays I just I and and\nGet more
