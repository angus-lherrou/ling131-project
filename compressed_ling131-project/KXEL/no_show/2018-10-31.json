have you been so far today or do you have someone else who keeps track and they just point you where there might be a a an audience and the police the\nI have a pretty good sense of where I've been today not have asked me where I'm going I might struggle with that but you know at first of all great to be back in and a good to be with you and you know\nI spent the beginning of this week traveling in western Iowa so I actually was able to go be at the farm over the weekend and then went down through Sioux City and kind of came back through Des Moines last night and then this morning\nWe took off into stopped in Williamsburg with ... manufacturing and visited them and then visited ... down in the Amanda colonies there and just a wonderful\nA family that's working they sell coy ah around the world there are a ... one of the leaders in production right here in Iowa so you get a chance to visit some great places like that\nThat's one of the things that for those of us who have lived in our whole lives we think of certain things we think of corn we think of beans we think of cattle and hogs and we might think of eggs just because we have been exposed to that from an educational standpoint but the wide variety of products produced in this state\nEven when you know it it's still surprising\nAbsolutely aquaculture is one of those where you go ... you know there's been a history of producing in this state\nNow where it's a smaller scale you know and and uh we're seeing some of that scale up but there's just one example right where you've got a nationally known producer right here in the state but again that's one of those things I Love about this job\nOr I take it very seriously the responsibility to get out get around the state meet with folks understand so\nYou know maybe it's a a you know just to circle back to the fish farm so there are some issues that we work with in terms of animal health right just like any other livestock or animal production in the state we've got a role to play as the department so I Need to understand what their challenges are\nAnd what the what things are working well for them\nYou know ... a visiting manufacturers is another important thing that I Do and ... he's a great example of one of these businesses that supports our agriculture\nOr and or you know they're experiencing some issues with workforce and they're experiencing some issues with the steel and aluminum prices and then also trying to sell into an ag marketplace that's experiencing some some challenging time so again just to sit down with those folks understand what they're dealing with very very important for a secretary of egg to do that\nBecause again it's a very broad job that some may just not appreciate remind folks of your background that led you to be appointed by the governor earlier this year\n... so a lot of doubts I'll go way back and just remind folks that I grew up in northwest Iowa so little town of cylinder up in Palo Alto county folks might know image for maybe a little more than cylinder but\nWe farm there and that so we have a family farm century farm there and like I said I was able to be up this past weekend but always have worked in agriculture I've always worked off of the farm I'm like a lot of people like me who grew up in the eighties and had to pursue jobs off the farm but I'm Still very much connected to that operation I found myself about five\nI'm like a lot of people like me who grew up in the eighties and had to pursue jobs off the farm but I'm Still very much connected to that operation\nHave found myself about five years ago are joining bill nor the at the department of Vegas his deputy secretary and then when bill went to USDA earlier this year as an under secretary the governor appointed me to fill out his term so I was sworn in march theft\nAnd by the way as I like to say I have never wondered if there's something to do every day I get up and I know that there are things to work on so it's been a great experience\nWhat are some of the things and and I always ask this question of elected officials because we as voters or citizens we think we know what you do but\nTell me a few things that you do in this job or part of this job that the average citizen may not know or maybe you didn't even realize it until it actually was your chair\nWell I tell you the or the department of egg and land stewardship really does cover a broad range of issues and so first and foremost my job is to run that department to make sure that we're\nYou know delivering the mission of the department of egg it's to a you know to represent all aspects of agriculture is to ensure consumer protection and then work to promote the responsible use of natural resources from the consumer protection side\nRight we do anything from a inspecting fuel pumps and are working with our dairy producers or egg producers are meat lockers you know fertilizer pesticides those are all things that we have programs than interact\nWe a significant part of our effort is around promoting soil health and water quality I spend a lot of time on those issues\nUm you know and then and then of course the the things I get to do to promote Iowa agriculture in trade and our markets as well so you know uh I get to do a whole broad range of things but my first job is to make sure I'm running the department of egg properly and that we're delivering on our mission\nMight ... the Iowa secretary of agriculture and land stewardship joining us live on who's talked Fifteen forty ... this is a campaign swing that you're making and so let's talk some politics before the election on Tuesday\nA lot of voters may have said overtime will what difference does it make if this person wins or this person wins I have suggested that from a political standpoint the sides have never been for the report and so you don't hear that a lot but I'll ask the question anyway\nWhat will be different with you having a four year term as a secretary as opposed to one of your opponent\nYeah well you know I think what I bring here is that a ... and look I I I view the state of Iowa as being very much on the right track right where\nI I think the Democratic candidate for governor has got a tall order trying to convince folks that were not on the right track and I also see that in agriculture I get it's not that we don't have this used to work on in our markets are\nOne area that we know that we've got to do better to uh open markets around the world and to provide support for our prices that are farmers are being paid but we're on the right track on the things that matter and when I look at those things that matter I think about\nMarkets for our products internationally markets for our products domestically so livestock and renewable fuels\nI'm making sure that we're doing the right things from a natural resource standpoint again focused on soil health and water quality in this area in particular I bring the experience of having been on the job now for over five years implementing our strategy working to get more conservation done\nAnd then the final piece in again this comes out this is borne out of traveling the state visiting with our farmers and our businesses and that's the here the concerns around attracting and retaining the workforce that we need an agriculture so I bring all of that experience\nI bring all of the uh you know having traveled the state now for the last seven eight months as the secretary interacting with Iowans\nI bring all of that to this uh this job and a passion\nI call it relational healthcare okay every month we asked our members to set aside a pre determined what we call a share amount to literally I'm sharing in the cost of members expense\nIt's currently two Ninety nine for single three Ninety nine for a couple five twenty nine\nFor a family of three or more we don't count more than three that goes into a secure online account we called our share box and then through our proprietary online technology that gets matched to another member of that month\nWho has medical bills and you transparently and openly gypsy your dollars flow from your account too there's you can message them with cheer within ...\nAnd you transparently and openly Jesse or dollars flow from your account to theirs you can message them with cheer with encouragement with prayer or whatever the case may be like a truce social community were standing with each other during those times sometimes the biggest crises of our lives\nWe cut the checks out of the receiving members account to the doctors and hospitals and we're using that methodology and members are paying each other's expenses to the extent of thirty million dollars of medical costs every month\nI have to imagine that in this era when we are so disconnected that's the irony of our current time we have the ability to be so connected and yet we seem to be as individuals so disconnected\nBut getting a word of encouragement from someone who knows about your individual health situation whether it's an emergency or simply a challenge\nThat has got to be a really inspirational message to get\nOh it's incredibly impactful we receive messages from our members regularly as to the effect the impact of that sense of a national uh connection of ... of community of support\nOr ... and not only just receiving it but sending it that is our members tell us that that's among the top two reasons why they love the liberty hill share so\nIt transforms their health care dollars\nAre in to a a a meaningful and valuable investment\nIn the life of another person no longer sending money to accompany black hole it my dollars are really changing the life and being supportive and a a ... and certainly investing in need of that particular living breathing human being that is transformative\nLiberty health sharing dot org is the website all one word liberty health shared dot org Dale bell is joining us on news talk they've seen forty can see how it to me it's also a fascinating story of how you came up with this and how you got from there to here would you mind telling that again for folks who may not be aware\nSure I I I've been a healthcare administrator for thirty plus years uh and really observed cow both Christian churches are and how ... health care costs were paid long before the advent of modern insurance\nUh that that's the way our costs were mad if we had a an expense of neighbors would surround us the local church the community center it's cetera I I just simply and observe that there were groups of people\nAre engaged with one another in participating with healthcare sharing with the passage of the Affordable CARE Act in twenty and I did my research launched liberty hill share as a way for people of conscience and faith\nOr to really meet each other's healthcare costs are and we started in twenty twelve and grown to about two hundred and forty thousand members in all fifty states\nThis is the time of year where we have what's called open enrollment and people certainly have a certain age just get inundated with direct mail and all sorts of other things and I know having dealt with\nAn elderly parent at one point it was just nothing but confusing\nTalk about as we're in this period of time where people perhaps as a family maybe thinking of these things again I Know it's always been a it was for many years it was a conversation around the Thanksgiving table in my family because of what I just mentioned talk about the timing of all of that and how liberty health share fits into the conversation\n[noise] yeah it is a become a Americans of kind of gotten trained to think in terms of health care changes during this open enrollment period at the end of the year uh and so we welcome folks to investigate liberty hill share during this time\nThey need to make a change your alteration of their healthcare arrangement now is a great time to do it although Jeff we're not subject that is liberty health care is not subject to the open enrollment periods so or ... even if there's some buyers' remorse ah folks can join us\nLiterally at any month in the course of the year because we are exempt from both the fines\nFor not having insurance and the mandate somebody for double CARE Act so folks can join us any month in the year but this is a good time to check it out see if it's for you and if this alternative meet your needs\nAnd that's an important point as I noted people are thinking about it this

Democrats said it showed how well thought of the Iowa candidates are to be specially singled out by Biden for attention like this\nWisconsin Democrats no doubt said the same thing when he stopped there in the morning before coming to Iowa and just as predictably Republicans that it showed how bad off the Democratic campaigns were to have to rely on Biden to do their campaigning for them\nSo as with most things they're both a bit right and a bit wrong\nIt's true that Iowa as a purple state has standing Democrat crosshairs for a long time but\nHow does the party have such a large voter registration advantage in the first district for example but a Republican has won the last two elections and the best time to knock off an incumbent is in the first attempt at reelection\nAnd while that's not a perfect fit to describe the governor's race to the point is made even stronger that the best time to knock Kim Reynolds out of office as before she's ever want to term on her own\nBut

accomplishment that was they were excited they were very happy um but it it was really a pretty remarkable effort and uh it might take some hindsight to really\nSee just what it was uh when when they look back on it but it's not the first time they've come back from a big deficit the seasonal ready and and so they're a team that right now has the [noise]\nThe reason to believe that they're never out of the game\nAnd it's got to be kind of special the do it on the road to your ads Sioux City house done was that Sioux City crowd\nThey ah I think they can kind of sense of coming after after it became five four I think things got a little nervous around the building and it was a Tuesday night it was not a full house at Tyson events center uh but you definitely could could feel the balance tipping\nThroughout the third period one of the goals you didn't hear there the first one in the third for the black clocks was a shot by Joe ... that was from an awkward angle that just sort of squeaked in\nAnd really should have probably been saved problem with a shot that get stopped Ninety nine out of a hundred times\nBut it was that kind of night for the black ... and ... again it was just those those little things that you could kind of feel the turning for the fans for the players on both teams uh you have a sense that um\nIt might be one of those nights where something crazy could happen but you know\nThe the ... performance is obviously remarkable scorn that many goals in a short period of time but defensively from a goalie standpoint you give up five goals essentially and the first to win maybe an eight period and then all of a sudden shut 'em out did they make a goalie switch or what happened there ...\nGold tenders uh they did that and the second uh and Jared ... came on\nSioux City had some pretty good power play success early on to which also was a big factor when you when you look at their scoring their first for a two of the first four run the power play and uh a couple of others were in situations where\nThere was just there was traffic in front of the net it was tough to get us a clean read on on the puck for Logan Stein and and the one gal that Jared ... gave up was a power play goal and he had at least two of his own defenders in front of him so he never saw the ... coming\nI'm so there there were a few minutes cues that that led to that and and credit to Sioux City for capitalizing on those opportunities Tim\nThe play by play voice of the Waterloo Blackhawks radio network on her village in VIP microphone are here on a Wednesday edition of old PR you've played a loving games now\nFor overtime to shoot out so six of the Olympic Games have went extra time what what kind of a year is that that that that's kind of a crazy number two isn't it this is not a good year to have a cold [laughter]\nFor time what what kind of a year is the ... that's kind of a crazy number two isn't it\nThis is not a good year to have a cold and and that's what I'm dealing with right now is the last night was not a good night to have a cold but hopefully it will take care of itself you know it's been exciting and again I think it goes\nBack to never being out of it if we go back to the very first game of the season in Pittsburgh at the usa gel for classic\nVery much the same in fact it was an identical score at the start of the third period that gained compared with last night down for the one the black arts came back tied it up at four forced overtime didn't get the win that night but did get the game to overtime got something to show for it by earning a standings point by pushing it beyond the end of regulation\nAnd so uh you know I think that's the that's the biggest thing it's it's ah it's always possible to get something and ah you know you\nLove to get the wind and regulation but if you can get that that first\nWell they did it again I needed a couple of new front tires after all the miles I've driven this past season so

slavery and the least he's explaining one happened here's what he wrote here's what he wrote\nHe wrote and I'm paraphrasing but what happened at the constitutional convention [noise]\nWas that they couldn't push the issue of slavery as far as someone or to push it\nAlthough some wanted to push it all the way that is the abolition of it because you wouldn't have the United states under those circumstances you wouldn't have brought in South Carolina Georgia and some of these other states in this there's no question that's the history\nOf what took place that's the history what took place Benjamin Franklin was an abolitionist\nAlexander Hamilton was an abolitionist several of them were abolitionist but they voted\nThe way they voted\nBecause they felt they needed to have a union and then from there they could address the rest that's exactly what took place you know who else took that position sixty years later well Seventy some years later Abraham Lincoln he explained it exactly\nThe same way that they had to leave it to their progeny their children and grandchildren to fix this issue of slavery\n\nBut if there hadn't been a union they wouldn't have been a civil war what lemonade\nThat's what the scientists rights for all intents and purposes\nTaking up the position that Lincoln took up taking up the opposition to Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton took up so\nThis guy Andrew Gillum says that demonstrates that just said this\nIt took us so this guy Andrew Gillum says that demonstrates that just said this wrote a book defending slavery\n\nNo this man has

producer and activists who founded people for the American way you know that group hardcore left wing trashes constitutional is nominees to the court\n\nGillum is faced controversy over his refusal to disavow dream defenders which has engaged in active is to promote the boycott of Israel as spouses anti patriotic anti capitalism anti military and anti police ideology with which Gillum has already been associated\nThat dream defenders website refers to the Empire State of Israel as quote the site of a continued settlers colonial project on ... to this is\nAll about anti Semitism\nAnd laments US
