got a lot of very cool recipes in here at ... by you and your wife too which is which is really something worth looking now let me ask you a question here is a\nNew York times comes up with this long article and I've now read most of it really trashing the president trashing his father attraction making these these these brought statements about how they're essentially tax cheats going back twenty more than Twenty years\nAnd um\nAnd they said they basically lost the IRS and they said well the Internal Revenue service basically you know look the other way and so for now the Internal Revenue service doesn't look the other way right and this is a huge\nAh you know family business it's privately held business I don't know how they got access to all this stuff so I don't know if it was in the\nIn the filings with the state or or whatever it was but they are trashing Trump is he's not a self made man and look at all the money he got when he was a kid and and on and on and on this is really a set up isn't it for the Democrats who keep saying we want Trump's taxes and they're kind of handing love working with each other here in the political way\nBut that's their playbook that only God I mean they're still litigating the twenty sixteen election they cannot believe they lost to this guy\nAnd why did they lose him because he cheated and he didn't just cheat at you know colluding with the Russians he cheated his entire business career and his family cheated his dad cheated they screw people in the welfare system so that they would get rich and ... you know the allegation is you know\nHe had said that he started Donald Trump did with just a million of his father's dollars but you know this story says oh what are they talking about I think I think I read\nFour hundred and Fifteen million dollars is what his dad gave him so he wasn't have felt may guy he was a bold into his father who was a cheater as well\nCrazy but you know let's let's see what the facts are right now is just one of these\nAllegations that it's been linked to a major\n... but it isn't isn't this the problem is a huge article yes\nOne allegation after another and what are we going to spend the next six weeks on this right through the mid term elections it's all time though I don't ever remember anything like this on the Kennedy family or Hal BJ became a multi millionaire just a poor man the because I got elected to the Senate he dies a multi multi millionaire I mean so much\nAnd and Trump makes all this money before even enters the presidency\nAnd they just can't wait to get their hands around his neck\nHow many times mark have we seen in the last year because it's been very effective\nThat are members of the left and the Democrats in particular have or\nHave worked with politician he would you want to talk about a collusion to look at\nThe link between the press and some a liberal Democrats for instance uh I was watching the special report\nProgram on Fox News and the and a a young correspondent who used to live at my house or Peter do see that you you were talking about a minute ago you know he's out in Montana and he was covering this story about uh the reelection campaign of John tester\nAnd Jon Tester's got a problem right now because a lot of Montanans are veterans\nAnd they don't like what he did to Dr Ronny Jackson who was the president's picked to run the VA\nBecause if you remember Jon Tester leaked these are allegations unfounded allegations are I think he first started out on the floor of the Senate or it was in a committee hearing\nHe had these pages of stuff about\nHow Ronny Jackson was a drunk and he crashed the car someplace and he did these inappropriate things and he was given people pills and all that stuff\nAnd you know what then it got into the bloodstream of the media and everybody was talking about it and the White House came out to like within a day and said look we've done a a an investigation we can't find anywhere that he crashed the car or\nThese other allegations but the damage was done and he was dead it was a kill shots and it all started with unfounded allegations and that brings us right to where we are today\nHow many times have we seen these things\nAnd it's just that they keep doing it because it's work\nSays well I Want to recommend that people have a little diversion here this is a really

time approaching five minutes pass to here's what you need to know today\n[noise]\nAnd among the stories were watching in the ... center Cedar Falls residents will not be allowed to own chickens or ducks as pets within the city limits\nCity councils out of that Monday Night when members voted for just re against an ordinance that would have allowed up to three animals no roosters in residential areas as long as they were licensed in kept at least twenty five feet from other homes\nCouncil member at large Rob green wondered why the ordinance referred to the birds as pets\nInstead of livestock

Williams now twenty four year old have on Washington ... thirty one year old core Darryl Smith\nForced the girls into Smith Sound son Adam street drank all night and then raped them Williams in Washington's attorneys said the sex was consensual Smith or denied his client at any sexual contact with the girls at all\nNone of this re though was convicted of kidnapping and that would have meant life in prison\nThey were found guilty of sexual abuse sentencing at a day to be determined and all three men remain in custody until that time\nAt the request of the Iowa department of natural resources the city of Waterloo will begin to deflate the bladder damn on October Fifteen that's a week from Monday\nAt the change from previous deflation that occurred at the end of October this year and a twenty four hour period the DNR now request that the deflation occur more slowly but over a one month long period\nSo this change in operations will have the damn being deflated approximately two and a half inches per day week days and again this will now start on October Fifteen as opposed to later in the year it had been the case in the past ... news time now to low seventies\n[noise]\nNine first alert forecast warm muggy and breezy today with ... and the lower eighties ... when the twenty to thirty mile an hour with some higher guy or the ... the storm in the end of the day here early tonight and our tank clears out behind weeks when you're out of the northwest and most fall to the lower forty\nFifty tomorrow I TV nine first alerts dorm the meteorologist\nAnd our tank clears out behind weeks when you're out of the northwest and most fall to the lower forty fifty tomorrow's Ninety nine first alert storm the meteorologist John fingers on new talk Fifteen forty the out there is a wind advisory\nThat is now in effect\nFor has now been issued rather and it goes into effect at five o'clock this afternoon until one o'clock tomorrow morning and it includes\nReally the western three quarters of the state of Iowa it does include when is she county in Fayette County and then everything along and west of us highway sixty three so it does include Waterloo Cedar Falls but does not include the court or again a wind advisory\nFive o'clock tonight to one o'clock tomorrow morning leaning gusts of wind the time's up\nTo forty five miles an hour\nIn addition still some flood warnings in effect for areas and that includes the cedar river in Cedar falls cedar river in Cedar falls is about a foot above flood stage it is continuing to fall after a crashed earlier\nThe black hawk creek at Hudson to point one feet above flood stage it again is falling\nThere is a high level of optimism I'm not sure it has as much to do with the tax cuts that the federal level and the promise tax cuts at the same level as much as it has to do with just really strong [noise]\nA really strong business cycle people are making a lot of sales or as you know a ... employment is incredibly high in Iowa almost too high\nA that people are optimistic because sales are so strong\nAnd you and I have talked on this program I have talked with many others about the fact that it appears business quote unquote in Iowa is poised to grow if only a few things could pop one of them has to do with\nCorporate tax rate and all of that that's a separate issue but the other has to do with the workforce and that is again the thing we keep talking about\nWhat strides are being taken to try to better serve not only the Iowans who are up and coming and going to have careers but also those employers who aren't just using it as an excuse that well we just can't find the right workers they really can't\nThey really can't I Would say Geoff and you're right you and I have talked so much about this over the years and you've been a real leader on this issue and a representative islanders were grateful for your leadership I I Would say for the first time I I feel somewhat optimistic about workforce issues and that boils down to three things one [noise]\nYou know there are all these programs they vi has want to call elevated Iowa you've been good enough to cover that there are many things future already Iowa governor and legislature creative that's a terrific I'm not sure who may or many others\nBut the critical mass of all these things seem to be having an impact compare finally more kids sang in Iowa and their mortgage choosing to up perhaps start with a pen called the green rather than a four year degree\nGet into the workplace in their employer will help them get a four year degree but those sorts of things and finally the parents are are coming along on that and now not necessarily a\nSaying to their could you've got to get a four year degree that's one thing we we think there is a critical mass building that's made that happen secondly\nThere have been great strides in automation and I were manufacturers in particular seem to be embracing\nAutomation and digital manufacturing partly because the cost of all sorts of things has come down and makes it doable um and of course the thing I Want to stress is that doesn't mean there are fewer jobs for people because we need all ... third I think there's a growing really realization than this thing I Hope in the country\nThat we're really need more people we've got to be more welcoming place immigration means to play a role and we need to make sure that it's handled the right way but we need to immigrants by one of those three things all seem to be building towards the critical mass of helping to address this problem finally\nWe are months away from a legislative session and having the election alone will tell us a lot about the future of the state from the governmental standpoint so it's far too soon to talk about any specific legislative initiatives but\nThere are some broad things that I Know your members would advocate if they could pass two or three pieces of legislation that might help address some of the things you just mentioned identify some of those if you could\nThanks so that opportunity a first and foremost and I'm going to be kinda disjointed here the good news is that [noise]\nSo if you could you bet thanks for that opportunity a first and foremost and I'm going to be kinda disjointed here the good news is that ah there's been bipartisan support for the teacher already island there should have\nAnd that's and that's a priority with us um you know in this day of hyper partisanship or perhaps more in DC in Iowa but it's certainly exists in Iowa it's good to have something we can all rally behind center ... in\nWaterloo has been a real leader representative Rogers and Cedar Falls has been a real leader um so many folks are and the governor of course I have been leaders I miss each already Iowa an issue that seeks to bring Iowans together around the idea that we need to train people get them into jobs we need to keep him here and we need to bring him home\nSo that is our number one priority [noise] um I'm going to jump a little bit and tell you that we had a new issue a rise in our quarterly survey and that is a material costs and in ... San I assume that's related to concerns about tariffs and trade that sort of thing\nBut we're hopeful that on the federal level the train agreements can be finalized there's reason for hope in that regard um when you get away from all the rhetoric it appears progress is being made\nSo those two things I hear a in Iowa workforce and gradually trade those two things seem to be coming together in a good way and we think positive\nSo what are some of the other things that you have found in this fourth quarter survey that either reinforce them things that have been frequently mentioned or perhaps the opposite side what are some things that were a surprise in addition to what you just sided with the inputs\nI guess one thing that was a surprise for us with the strength of optimism nearly three quarters of the response to respond and to this survey\nSaid that they expected a sales to increase in the fourth quarter of twenty Eighteen those that didn't say they would increase so they would say the same nobody expected to do less business and of course are folks tend to be pretty um\nMercenary when it comes to a business prospects of I don't think they're going to make sales they don't they don't think they're going to make sales and they tell you that but they're all\nVery very optimistic um there was also chocolate or they're meeting they found ways to meet demand a much more uh uh some of the respondents talked about alternative workforce or\nSolutions like a split shifts or ah ah somebody might come in on the week and not come in during the week or they might have alternative shift hours I all sorts of different things\nAnd uh I guess that that kind of innovation use is exciting to see to\nWe have talked on this program about your organization and what you do but for those who might not have heard speak before identify what eighty I is who its members are and and what your goals are\nUh the Iowa association of business and industry as Iowa's oldest and largest state wide business association a trade association\nFor manufacturers in for businesses and all kinds of Fifteen hundred member companies and companies are members not individuals so we have members in all Ninety nine of Iowa's counties and uh we work on a number of things are they're all tied to three main programming raise public policy advocacy a member training in advance and I'm\nA community and leadership development I'll come back to that last one in a minute the profile the navy I remember company a lot of times people think of a John Deere or a ... Collins or or the other big global companies and we're thrilled that their members they are members and we love them but the typical member company is\nMuch smaller maybe a couple of hundred employees United equipment\nAccessories in Waverly is a perfect example of a guy member company with about three hundred employees a and and a privately held company there are tons of those in Iowa and we we have a ton of 'em an ATM are grateful for that\nYou have been in this role supporting business and industry for a number of years\nAnd we have done through you mentioned mechanization computerization et cetera there have been a number of ships in the business world if you will not the least of which is the global impact and government sometimes assisting and sometimes well not assisting as much as as they could\nOver the course of time what has changed the most about what you do in terms of advocating for your members\nBoy that's a great question and you know when I think about it I've been here for almost fourteen years\nAnd probably in the beginning um public policy advocacy was far and away the number one a program area Navy I over time [noise] I'd say maybe the biggest changes the balance between all those and here's how I mean obviously it's still important foreign Iowa business person to know that\nThere's somebody looking out for a policies and regulations and laws help businesses grow and of course we still do that\nBut they also training and education is so important and so our members services or a team that does a training on very exciting topics like a a worker's compensation or environmental compliance all sorts of things [noise]\nUh that's where we do those kinds of things where we're putting on programs all over the said all year long and then lastly because workforces such an important issue that whole ab I foundation side of community and leadership development things that help the community growing so same itself those are much more important than ever\nAnd that last point is is up such great interest because as I understand it the younger\nPeople whether you call the millennials or whatever label\nThey are much more willing\nTo move to a place and then find a job as opposed to some of us who are more senior who moved because of the job and we know in the cedar rally of the initiatives to\nShow young people show anyone but especially young people this is a great place to live move here and then we'll help connect you that is a big difference as\nIt is a big difference that's why programs like leader valley or the or the other exciting things that are going on in Cedar valley are so important you're right that today's workforce really uh they want they want to work hard at a job they love\nBut they also want to have fun things even when they're not worth balance is much more important and so that's why they want to go to fund places like the cedar valley and that's why the things that the cedar valley and others are doing are so important\nLast late when we talk in four or six months let's say we're going to be the key things that you think are different in terms of any of these issues if we just project a quarter three months or a six month period\n[noise] well two things one the election will be behind this will know the results or whatever the results are that'll be interesting secondly ah they're they're all have to be something on trade either while there'll be a decision on trade neither will know that these meals didn't get done and there are so great uncertainty are terrorists will have had a greater impact\nOr through the local folks ... had been on the program in the past and we said we'd love to have him on and through a couple of phone calls that his people made to us on Monday we had confirmed that we would be here at four o'clock so that we could record an interview that could air on our program Tuesday\nSo for ... five o'clock and no Michael Blake so in essence we were stood up [noise] so I don't need that descriptor sheet anymore but if you were wondering why we did not have the interview with Michael Blake of the Democratic National Committee\nWe had a day at a time and he apparently had other things to do so apologies for that we like to tell you when folks show up we also over to you to tell you why they why you didn't hear what you might have hurt\nAlso on the political scene this news in this afternoon from the black hawk county Republican Party their annual Lincoln dinner fund raiser is this coming Sunday\nIs that the brown derby ballroom in

Sorenson Mason Palmer Michael ... Jacques\nA James ... ruining all returning defense meant so very rare to see that many returns on on on you know in terms of defense men in the U. S. H. L. so we feel like that's a strength and and we've got some young bodies a you know in terms of scoring goals who who are going to have to step up and the opportunities there I mean I I guess that's\nMore than anything you know yeah we don't know\nThat we don't know what what their production will end up looking like at the end of the season but they're going to have a lot of opportunities to to put the ... in the back of the net\nJob green vice president of Waterloo Blackhawks hockey on her village in VIP microphone a lot of sports teams it seems like in this day and age at all levels have like a a a kind of a team\nThe team or model maybe it's hash tag all enter hash tag ... anything any is there anything new or special ... with the Blackhawks maybe this isn't necessarily even something that you're you're publishing are putting out there but the team has a a theme or kind of model for the season you know within the locker\nRoom I Would say not yet I'm typically are coaching staff\nAre really rallies are guys around a theme when you get closer to the playoffs you know a second half of the season let's see what kind of team we have and then build the theme from there from a from a front office perspective you know last year um we introduced a theme it's all about family and and that\nTheme or really worked well for us it worked well because our players obviously we feel like our family together and that locker room are season ticket holders are fans are part of our black hawks family our alumni et cetera and we introduced a new family four packs a family offerings to fans last year so we really felt\nLike that that everything just really fit well with that theme and every year since I've been here we've come up with a new theme\nAnd this summer I said why change a good thing if it's working in it it really works for us in our fans they they they love it they feel like they're they're part of this black ... family and\nAnd so we're going to continue that with that is the first time in a long time we've we've carried a theme over from the previous season but but again we really feel like it's worked for us and and we're really proud of of our fan base and and the strong following the we have\nA and and so we just feel like it it's a great fit for what we're all about here in\n... and you're you're always going to use that also party town it's party town there's no doubt about that well you know it's it's it's just so much fun\nOn game nights you know young arena and and it's you know we see other players go you know we have players who have left to go play other you know elsewhere in our league we have players who come from other teams and that's that's the feedback that weekend is just the atmosphere here compared to some other arenas and franchises are lake so\nWe take a lot of prior to that are fans do we've had you know probably the best home ice record in the league and I haven't looked at this but I Know we have the best home ice record in the league last season\nI Would say over the past three seasons we're probably one or two in the league in terms of our home ice record so are we protect our whole lives well it's it's a it's a it's a rock is atmosphere and it's a combination of of diehard hockey fans and and your casual fans that you know what this is our hometown team I maybe I don't know much about hockey but\nI'm a black hawks fan I'm here to support her hometown team in here to to have a good time and with the rest of our community\nA rather interesting start to the season you go out and play in the fall classic in Pittsburgh right you go to Pittsburgh you play two games and they counted this year\nIn the in the standings just just talk about the opening weekend and and what the the coaching staff said when they got back and just your thoughts on an opening up with the wind and an an overtime loss right\nRight exactly well I think any time you can pick up three out of four points on the weekend and and even in a neutral location\nTo start your season is is is a good thing you know that's a positive so um you know again we've got a lot of youth especially for so we've got to get these as experienced the speed of the regular season is a game changer compared to pre season uh and so\nYou know there's just not to be made and I thought uh my personal opinion and watching the games I didn't go to Pittsburgh but uh was our guys adjusted well a and you could see that on and they're certainly on on game too um so so I think I'm from a coaching staff perspective that's a long trip a lot of these guys are first really long bus trip\nA so a lot of stress you know early in the season first time on the ice or and so I thought we responded really well I think we're pleased coming out of the weekend or three or four points\nJoe it's a really long season in the usa gel but it seems like it's always important to get off to a fast start how important is that for this year's team I\nIt is at the same time or you know this is a young team and and you have to be patient and I think if you if you've read any of of your head coach became family's close to the newspaper articles with Jim Nelson at the courier here here recently\nYou'll find that you know ... stated a we've got a lot of talent on this roster but it's a process than it's going to take some time and we've got to be patient\nPut in the work to get there but I I think he believes are coaching staff believed the talent or is there on our roster so it may take some time to to\nTime and we've got to be patient put in the work to get there but I I think he believes are coaching staff believed the talent or is there on our roster so it may take some time to to to play at that level consistently\nUh but again tremendous start to our season getting three out of four points were on the road to times this weekend before finally our first home game on October thirteenth and\nAnd uh you know we're excited to protect home ice and get back you're young arena and and uh certainly on October thirteenth will be unveiling our Anderson cup championship banner on on opening night and there's got to be an exciting time for a lot of these players are first experience with who you know in front of a big crowd here in water though\nAnd as you mentioned to road games this weekend to Des Moines on friday then you come back across the state go to Illinois and play at Central Illinois on Saturday So another road trip this weekend before you get that home opener\nOr just talk about some of the things that the fans are going to see when they when the Blackhawks do get that home opener underway on October Thirteen\nOr Saturday October thirteenth kicking off the home part of your schedule anything

so and replayed really good competition and uh you know we've had our chances in a couple of games but we'd make some mistakes and do some things that have a cost us a few setbacks and uh\nKnow our kids one thing to them or they persevere they don't give up\nI'm On fire a lot of teams could drop their head and a peek came out and put one right in on us on a kickoff return and our kids didn't

come out with the wind and it's always nice to be a ...\nBig performance for your quarterback senior kale Krueger he was very active on the ground he also of course throwing the football Ninety six passing yards plus a another hundred and twenty on the ground and he was active on defense to everywhere things were happening it looks like he was\n... it was a good leader for us um he really stepped up and do some things uh he he doesn't really just he doesn't blossom doesn't shine great but what he does he does everything very very well um and then you know it's just we we depend on him a lot he does a great job\nObviously those numbers stood out statistically who else had a big game that led to the victory twenty two Thirteen the final score against a pie last friday\nYou know I mean I I really felt it was a teen thing we couldn't have done it together you know we had a freshman come in middle linebacker um and he had to step by step up make some place we move some people around we put bashing corner instead of safety and move Miller from corner to safety\nI thought that was a great decision on defense to really help us out a ... far they took on double teams in Logan county and R D and to send the door and did a super job caught in the writer as really step up these last few games\nAnd Big Bend a big player for us on offense and defense um you know counter Smith it all back and middle linebacker has been get better and better every game and he's a good he doesn't say much but boy you know he leads by his actions and\nUm it just kinda was our time and these guys just kept fight and fight and a great things happened to guys at the don't\nEver give up red beret is the head football coach for the Denver sank loans and looted the challenging schedule just looking at the non district games ... New Hartford ... west Marshall in North Fayette bally regardless of class there's some really good football programs and that group\nThere was you know and we knew that coming in and we knew that were really young you know and a lot of I told our kids this week you know I I said you guys are on five but man you know and it's hard to tell people get\nTheir head because when you get to on fire the band were just really bad or not we're very competitive team and we can step up and the ball just does not really bounced our way and we've had some ... like I said earlier on in this interview that we've had some setbacks little things jumping off sides I mean that Osage we went up\nTo ... in three minutes left in the game but the\nThe style is called back and forth down because we had a guy jumped so you know then they go down at scoring\nGames over so it just ... is a ... it's been a rough season but this is definitely helped do we just have to keep plugging along with our last three weeks\nThe sank loans have an opponent up next that's been playing very well this season much like so many of those other program senator Fredericksburg just suffered their first last severe\nWith your teen picking up the first when their team picking up a a loss for the first time what do you expect from the standpoint of atmosphere and mentality from this game this week\nWe're you know I mean some of their ... their plan for a playoff berth but we're we're just trying to stay alive and uh you\nKnow we're pretty close and you\nKnow some there they'll come at you all the time I mean they're just they bring and they bring their rushing game and it's very very good our defense is going to have to be ready to play 'em they're very physical team was some explosive athletes that they have and uh\nWe're gonna have to play them but not make mistakes goes mistake little things will get us in trouble against them and that's what we're gonna have to do not give up the big plate and make them er and everything and uh we can't make mistakes\nLet me ask you about this game and a different context in a way back when district football was first introduced there were a lot of people who criticized ... broke up traditional rivalries and schools that were next door to each other didn't play because one school was in a district that was a little bit larger than the other or whatever the circumstances might be\nA we've talked a lot of coaches this season with the games very similar to this one where\nDenver and some in Fredericksburg aren't too far away and Clinton Parkersburg isn't that far away north butler coming up on the schedule isn't that far away are those games more fun than a game against say like males are always said to wear those schools are more distant\nYou know we'll play who we play and we'll have to get it done with against whoever it is\nIt it is fun to play the walk to bally's there's something there Fredericksburg your ... for schools you know what I
