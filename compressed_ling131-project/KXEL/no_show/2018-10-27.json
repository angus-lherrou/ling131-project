Swenson obviously factors into that quite a bit of ... you just can't really walk him\nWhat one guy so a surprisingly I think I I didn't expect this to defend has been the strength and\nWestern Illinois there they're off in ... has been so inconsistent I didn't see that come and Gary and the defense has has kept him closed and games and really has won them games as well wrap it up with the keys do oh western Illinois when today world that they're running game of struggle and last week there they're coming up their best game of the year\nThey went for two hundred sixty yards they didn't have that total in the previous four games combined so\nI'm not saying you got to go out and run for two hundred sixty arts against this the friends but you got to be able to run it a little bit I think from a Leatherneck perspective\nAnd just try to get Sean something besides having to ... to rely on him to make players so get that running game going a little bit and a defense away that you're facing a team that thrives on turnovers and grow that Iowa was so good it's a classic pad their scene they get better and better and better\nHere goes on so how do you beat a good team you try to beat him in the turnover margin that I think that's a big today\nI Try to steer one from a admittedly great quarterback and he lives in a really good they are running backs up and said why so easier said than done but I think that that's keys or west or no no it's a very good insights got to have a great call best of luck the rest of the year Barry thank you so much I have a great call Scott\nCorn

scouting report on the panther opponent Scott scouting report on western Illinois has brought you by Bud Light game gays favorite light logger reminding you to enjoy\nResponsibly and enjoy this game responsibly to go\nThat's right it would be nice afternoon to enjoy one of those adult averages that's for sure yeah All right take a look at the Leatherneck defense first of all\nWe're going to see a three four look today Gary it's a you know not all that uncommon but it used to be real popular but did they do they're doing a good job but if they're given up about a twenty nine points a game teaser rushing it for about a hundred and thirty seven against them\nAnd throwing for about a hundred and eighty nine so they're given up on you know in the three hundred and twenty three hundred and thirty are category averaging under five yards of flights are defensively they've been pretty good and you know like we talked about when they can get turned over ... they they have a good chance of winning the game they're minus three on the year in the take away your category\nBut it when they won the games is three wins they been able to get more turned out worse than the opponent so that'll be a key here today only allowed to use to convert on thirty percent\nA third down so that's a pretty good third down defense are getting off the field\nAnd things are tried nine for down plays against them and converted five of them so in a red zone they're pretty good teams of only scorn eighty five percent of the time when they get in a red zone and only fifty eight percent of the time are those scores touched down so they they went up down\nAnd what you better be good in that they were outstanding ... did what a health problems or did you know it's making our team better ... better team probably because of the injuries that have happened to us and I hate to say it that way but maybe because of these you know she has given more players opportunities and and more people are involved\nAnd so it's it's it's it's been a benefactor force but we're still missing the guy that we don't get back 'cause 'cause you know we we lost some good players to along the way what did\nYou see out of your players how focused did they come back to practice this week that that you noticed in preparation for this one today with western Illinois\nYou know I have to gauge practice so I've had some terrible crack says and then Thursday night was not the best practice in the world but\nThe message to him as we'll play Thursday night and we play on Saturday and the only way you learn is experience and that's what\nWhen you have some freshmen start force and they have some senior seniors understand that they know how to get themselves ready they know how to get prepared they don't need a great motivational talked to come to practice or to work at it because they know what it takes for a young guy\nYou know he doesn't understand the importance of the rest of the urgency of this because it's his first season left us a maybe a second season a senior knows he's down to four games\nA freshman thinks he's got four years so there's a big difference of how you're trying to gauge the whole team to get them in line to get them ready to play every Saturday today\nWestern Illinois the opponent a dangerous opponent talk about what your deep answer will face a when when the leather next have the football led by their senior quarterback Sean Maguire\nTomorrow we're facing number one shop acquires is as a tremendous ...\nUh when when the leather next have the foot bullet by their senior quarterback Sean Maguire\nTomorrow we're facing number one Sean Maguire is is is a tremendous competitor and you know he he will says teams of the winds that me and he's always backed are fighting for the actually are fighting for the extra play for down quarterback he's going to go for they're going to go for for down they're not going to walk away his is going to be a ...\nYou look at mc Shane Shane is probably the most dynamic player in our league or he's got great speed he's got great athleticism quickness he's a senior I mean those two alone you give them a chance to be very successful and off and\nThey have a young often see blind three red shirt freshmen a red shirt sophomore and a senior up front is there some way you can you can take advantage of that with with your defense so\nWe're going to find out I mean a heart defensive line a nice do a great job or defense on paper a needs to step up to the plight because when we start talking about the opposite side of the all of this is all gonna flip to to to advantage western Illinois so we've got to do a great job on defense\nGotta contained Mick Shane [noise] we've got to find a way to confuse to make a\nChoir and it'll take all eleven guys on that side of the football it to do their job but it was there or is it the line is that the line backers is that the deep end she backs at the most stressful beyond today because of what what western Illinois wants to try and do ...\nI I'd say what's going to get stressed today as the perimeter of our defense supply action passes the perimeter containment how they do so much side to side and vertical that did all the players and it's going to happen all the multiple formations multiple\nPersonnel groupings they're all over the place so uh we're gonna have to we're going to have to be chewed up to do your job is kind of like plan option football today there's going to be guys that are signs of things that the one things go on the left but the other players go on to the right and it's always on the same flight so here you got your response for the right side you better take it 'cause\nSometimes you don't know where the ball's that I mean as much [noise]\nIt's it's crazy football as it is it's much like option football\nThey have a senior Laden deep sea unit a good defense unit talk about your off and then a lead by your senior quarterback Eli done what what are what are they going to be able to do what's the game playing against that Leatherneck defense\nWell number one we need to protect our quarter back these guys are getting up early Seventeen facts are ready to seize an awful lot of sex so and he ... probably killing drives for Craig turn over so that past pressures crate turnovers that pass pressure is creating parts\nSo they're killing dry so we got to be able to protect our quarter back to got to be able to run the football against this front because to loosen up\nAnything you got to be able to get over the top of it and then if you get over the top ... than it might loosen up and if it loosens up you've got to be able to run the football so I think the first thing we have to do is be able to throw the football today and\nAlways have to be able to Russia football [noise] the the wild panther wild cat ... part of the plan today to\nFit it could come out that that things on the docket any day of the week right now it's a it's it's been a system since August pull it out when when when it presents itself but uh I just know that every team has to practice for it and they're going to spend ten minutes a day three times a week or so they're gonna spend thirty minutes of practice time on it\nAnd and does it cost us that much practice time anymore so we can run or off to jump into that\nWe don't have a lot of time invested in it but at the same time they invested thirty minutes of a of a three days worth of practice on and so I think if anything it might loosen up some other things and if they haven't worked on it and it's going to show up then and uh and will use it [noise] special\nTeams it will probably be big again today coaches a tight game a fourth quarter again you've talked some about their
