C. S. football\nThey're unanimously rank number one in both polls this week unanimously\nA hundred and eighty six people cast a ballot on who they think\nShould be the number one ranked team in all of that cs football in every one of a hundred and eighty six of them said North Dakota states the number one team and apps yes football and the Panthers were ahead of him thirty one twenty eight going into the third quarter it was still thirty five thirty one a four point bikes and lead\nWith six and a half minutes to play so I I just as a coach barley is there a\nSilver lining or a positive take from that game that you can say guys you know if that's the best team and apps yes football you're right there with them a\nSilver lining in this game or a big positive that everybody thinks this is Martha ... who my mother was a thirty five thirty one game six minutes to go you're right there with them is is that something that\nYou feel we're that close to where we want to see this year with his\nPress broke for other people to judge him for us to prove that the end of the day is a [noise]\nWhen you look at it from the players standpoint or from the film standpoint you know you can look at and those set of eyes but we didn't go in that thing to win a consolation prize you know it was it was\nWhen we went we we went after\nBreak from start as you saw which we took the football and and uh and to some very good things ... blocks away at ... uh\nHe just finished the first half way hopefully would probably countered every punch that was thrown even at\nEven finished the first half the way it hopefully would probably countered every punch that was thrown even at\nA you know after they hit the [noise] they took to leave for the first time that we do the field in and took to lean back [noise]\nYou know so those things that was it was that kind of back and forth football game which it always is [noise] and all the way through that says six minute mark when when they when they got to buy their second possession that's why I have to start doing some wheeling and dealing to try to try to create something to to to win that game but uh [noise]\nAt the end there are some things that his walk away and say there is some players play very well jail and James player the game\nPlays best football game and allow blocked his tail off may some great catches on did a tremendous job all day long [noise] they should remember that game it was a loss unfortunately for for us but a play about as well as you can play that position force [laughter] I thought he live play very well [noise] ... play very well\nI did a great job with the past Russia and things they do there's great protection [noise] hell so there's those those tight end you watch a live play watch Bradley play [noise] ah\nWe played we played [noise] we\nPlayed very good ... good enough to win and that's we we only take the field for one purpose so [noise] somebody else can get the constellation prize we need to find a way to get ready for South Dakota and move forward\nIt coach probably I I I like how he put it when when looking for that silver lining you said that's for others to judge and for us to prove that uh\nThat we do um as far as the passing game that's another thing that coach barley was asked yesterday at his press conference that the you know the passing game was pretty good and he lied done he at like nine different receivers in that game on Saturday\nWell as we go back in the spring and camp\nI felt that the fence was very close and the office had the experience of the personnel in the office of line and the tight and to [noise] to be a very often and you're starting to see that and that was that was the first [noise]\nFirst big test that they were up against was was and that was in that fashion that they had read them [noise] um and and play very well no the receivers are really\nA progress probably the most sense camp I mean that they're the ones that you look at what's [noise]\nAnd like us where there's change what's happened since cameras you analyze it and I'd say that the receiver progression and then add any of that group I mean there are multiple players the client fast they're blocking down field\nAnd they're making contest that catches and that's what they have to do to make your office go so [noise] uh I thought I thought as a group Fauci\nA tanks crime\nA [noise] a\nShame I mean he lives not picking and choosing the guy's climbed the fence and and uh [noise] and he played he played a play a very good football game you through the heck out of the football game and [noise] uh act last drive right for half an", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "09"}
