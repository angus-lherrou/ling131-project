retribution for the number of times cops have killed African American men so he sought out officers to kill me perceived to be white and he murdered them in cold blood using semi automatic weapons and then went on a course killed himself\nThat's a big story same thing happened Baton Rouge same thing happened with the rain most in lieu officers in New York City\nAnd then there is a regular event in our country where a police officers your gun down not because of the color of their skin but the color of their uniform which is blue\nWhat is it and the national consciousness occasion by the national media that causes such other disrespect for police officers that we'd minded nationalist another hate filled individuals many mentally ill will take it upon themselves to\nHunt down officers to kill the murder without good reason I I like to see media coverage of that event tell me why that is going on and tell me why the president of United States\nBrock Hussein Obama were knowingly and

cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from us and we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and it has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars

or\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect not what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent\nSo we're taking in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China\nHas been look China is the biggest ... by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost over the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with

going to have a hundred and forty five judges\nThings have happened since justice now justice cabinet Fifteen Fifteen to judge many many judges and we're going to have a hundred and forty five year just fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin are because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the men are great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law of unintended consequences because I've had many women were spurred my air you know bill I'm with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base or otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nBeen a great friend of mine and I

journalist and we're at one eight six six five oh Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey and the great falls Montana and the case for you good evening\nYeah I uh I was just thinking that there seemed to in my memory and there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least the portions of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me let me expand upon that point [noise]\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage that directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect [noise] and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope he should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence and his in our nation's hill and they're a dilemma that we're helping them with so that's my ...\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts are ... to the caller\nAnd trying to think about different things that might can be done so and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here I'm not let them by as much land and property\nOh maybe were to use the number of people at their embassies here I'm not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this\nUm but yeah so I may not see your point there's this gym in our talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are good and bad nobody to sell the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nIn some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula of Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think you should give us a pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts\nFor I'm not giving them a mass either I just ... there's no law we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nOr the brutality again what we have so far or ... or you don't pass it off no no no no just let me be clear about this loop we at this juncture does not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that when\nYou look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets to be headed during an entirely agree\nAs soon as I heard of that I thought okay that what that means is they tortured\nHim doing that I really agree on it have you\nEver had lived anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not using it I'm simply saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose to spite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nWill not wait just a minute we do not know the government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nIEDs won't feel the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when you have a ... when you have a group

finished my day when we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or to this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone into a conflict you portray\nObviously not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very cynical to edit that I go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone\nThat obviously you judge or to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion the ads for of course the what I post was it wouldn't be better\nAnd uh do you come up with some kind of have a better answer other than just were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nHarmful to the United states handled the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that are responsible answer a ... year they thought from USA Today as we go to the next call here\nYeah we do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the

know really she could have lost her life but she showed where the Saudis have fourteen carriages go five states in their account Barnes why are we sending money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand a that they get our money that part I must confess a is a is a little hard to understand\nBut I don't understand it all I Know I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them a damn\nYeah again as I say

big screen brutality or could be sent their message out I mean I Would think they want to read just described would end up itself be ah shall we say I'm a pleasant enough aid to send a message to dissidents\n[noise] well it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman that evil sort of regime and they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so\nI that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states in this uh this kind of

having the freedom to chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed\nAnd now everything have allies as that and and I don't honestly think that the government would have been so stupid as kids pull a stand like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a ... gallons of course we don't even really of what happened\nYou know we do but the thing about this rogue elements in a consulates ... these are not just the bases like boutiques on the shopping center where you just wander in now but people\nCan decide to do something

easy to get a little that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race on governor and senator in Florida and the rates but senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that John\nAh several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year and the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote a and B in Florida I don't know what insight you have heard about those two states and I had relatives who live in Florida\nAnd I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have now so tired I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you to get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I think Korea is going to win I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's near fool's gold like he was from Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida as more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial races is also if he so that'll depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal which they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrats' side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house I Am about the Senate I think that while I'm all for individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm content to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation and and I'm In you know in Florida or tech this but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrat who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and don't they understand that they're going to have\nA ten percent tax if an governor's race does one find the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and die as that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care and they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand their for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrat to invest and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the the ... and people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it and so I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use a livable wage these things are the uh on the surface if you don't explored they oh that sounds like a pretty good idea or equal pay for women had and they have no idea the background that they're talking about an attorney at the same job necessarily\nA and then it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have on women so a lot of leftist and liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people did not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was floored when Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people ... people basically don't want to go through that and that's when the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh\nI think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him so badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nUh so they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know

oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia and the thing I can get my kids have American citizenship if they just born here well I'm going to time my trip so\nThat I have the baby now of course I could go wrong if babies lady and I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah\nOwners mark Yes sir hey I'm your on your mark or you know well great I'm well\nI'm a recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe left she left she's gone and it's the fast track to green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous\nPrevious speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then\nThey want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience um other than to live with it you know with a lawyer fees everything\nThat I guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders\nI'm under the way the actors to women against violence I'm back um so if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are serious the fast track to green card and\nAnd and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking my father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMoran march I keep hearing these wonderful terms thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do [noise]\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have an illegal immigration we have an in Beijing going oh these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and more being invaded by the failures of the other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf there was any if it was their military doing it we will be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent lay allowing this to happen this is absurd\n\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe is anything special about the United states of America Says that the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against the President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue is not the least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to ... there's so many good calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably mess that ups than Iran with mark\nAnd mark a Greek call you know there are got a great program there but I really appreciate it I'm actually in New Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a scapegoat in your enemy territory for a while [noise]\nAnd the hope we can get ... out of their all God but I'm just calling basically uh uh\nI guess illegal voting but I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people illegals not only voting but\nOr the radio while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people illegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states and it was like really absurd\nAnd I was sick and um you know how to stop that and if you remember like during the uh where we were sitting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting\nAnd dying their ... you know their thumb purple you know they couldn't vote more than once and I'd say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here [laughter]\nSo we wouldn't have\nKnown not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over a voter id and the other side of the money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know the home or being racist remain this you know how could you do that yet that by the way my position is different than most and I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put forth some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or you get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also a about\nA year for the voter id\nThey make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote and you know that you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that [noise]\nAnd while you're there voting or if they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id are already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera feed into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up in another ward or district or state on the same day\nAnd you know like you said a digital camera you could check in check and see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age but at the same time you could be starting a voter\nId for you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card in a week or so you know ah [noise] you go back and you bring to the id to them mail it to them [noise] and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of a ...\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side does they want voted for ... thank you so often I Know that but there's another point that you didn't think\nI don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen the people work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name have to abide by Pennsylvania or new or no originally you know yeah I'm right right so you go in the ...\nWho are you oh Martha and that's when you go over to that\nTable you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever want to marry and vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to he also gave them cameras to take the picture I don't think someone you have stand you have some good ideas but they're not going to work have agreed evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have that went into vote one time there was a primary and um they had a they asked them if I can have a right in ballot\nOr right and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never writing about I walked in here and it wouldn't take it\nAnd I was like\nTotally me they said well you know what's going on and he said well [noise] oh oh you know you're a you wanted to vote Republican or Democrat [noise]\nLike I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot [noise] and I says well you said I could ... says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in dollar is that\nRight yeah I I thought it

don't have to the parents don't have to have a ... as you say you find the citizens of sovereignty\nAnd some minor ... and the colors can let us know if we're wrong but that's how my understanding that if if they're born here and that's why you see the people come here all the time you we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital and people come here from other countries and tried to time and some of the baby can be born here\nI and if I'm wrong call me an eight six six Ninety rent I I Want to know I don't want to say something that's incorrect\nLet's go to\nLet's go to rich in

understand it\nTerrorism relies on the the fear of\nThe use or the fear of the threat of force of violence corps and intimidation to subdue the opinions abuse the will of the people that is directed at so\nI think it would be safe to save her at the leftists by and large are domestic terrorists\n\nThat would be something I Would think that would that's that's that's the way I'd go with that I mean if if I mean look there they're shooting at the ballpark shooting up Steve ... snow you know I mean the by the grace of God the man still alive today\nOkay um you just you just had a conversation with a gentleman a couple of callers I go and I I think you made the comment correct me if I'm wrong I don't want to put words in your mouth he might become you're you're a little bit worried about

say by the way I did say I'll take my chances of winning I'd rather we in and see what happened so I'm not going to lose be intimidated by them\nOh okay okay that I stand corrected Yes sir Yes sir so yeah I mean and and that so I mean the whole thing with a with the Charlie Hebdo shootings or Europe Europe is going to be gone and fifty years but because they're scared to death to do anything about

weapon deployed against America ever\nKnow he went on an apology tour when he started apologize for one of the greatest country in the world you're a ... he was apologizing for us it was a kid he\nDid you how how dare you apologize for the country that elected you to start with I'm Sorry we elected and so yeah apologize for that I didn't know I can trust me I didn't do it [laughter] you know\nI mean you get you gave me agree to you gave me a great idea after he did his apology tour ... yeah after he President Obama did his apology tour you and I and the rest of us should have gone out of

get it\nBut you know rich what's funny is that after President Reagan was finished and even more so when he passed away all of a sudden the same liberal outlets in the media were saying oh he was such a good guy such a nice guy you'd think wait a second you the same people that said would you do when he was around about starting\nTo handle a George W Bush the younger now too they're starting to oh well yeah maybe he wasn't so bad they've got another person to directed at and I ... I and you know like I'm fifty four okay so I'm not I'm not a spring chicken but I'm not a I'm not from a purely that older if I've got\nA figure myself you know fifty four okay\nGood lord man I don't

making the world are much much more slightly places I've gotta thank you\nUm ... you know not that old buster big up there but you know thank you you know and I wanted to ask you Sarah if there's one thing as Jack Welch set a or a visitor with Jack Welch and he's been on the show and I said jak if there's one element you can only pick one\nThe most important element of becoming successful what is that this was raped his living room in his home in Boston and he looked at me and he said John\nDifferentiation if I could only pick one it's differentiation then if you had one\nReason why one reason to separate to differentiate Spanx in your company products from everybody else what was that one thing be\nWow I mean that is such a great response that jak sad 'cause I completely agree with him and the one the one thing that bank has done as differentiated cells because every single product that we've created is now we're patterns on almost all of our products there are things that I had never been done before her love of\nAbsolutely love it you know so it's you get an idea of the ingenuity that creativity and now you're going to hear the story will go back to the beginning of where Sarah came from and as you hear the story\nI'm really really I'm trying to impress upon our young entrepreneur is are any entrepreneur you've got to hear how many great anecdotes and how many strategy so her team was put together knocked out by the story so let's go back I or were you originally from personal\nI grew up on Clearwater Beach Florida near and a half on the west coast and I'm In a sign of a beach girl at heart\nGreat and and your your father was a professional right\nMy father was a trial attorney and my mother was an artist\nAnd I would assume when you think about that you have a nice blend of influence from professional to creativity combined the business and creativity\nI I really do I mean when I look at it I think I got such a great blind both of my parents\nAnd will do they encourage you to be an entrepreneur as a child sure\n... not really I mean there was never in my my family always encouraged me to go to the beat of my own drawn and to believe in myself but there wasn't ever a you know\nStrong you know any kind of coaching going that direction of an entrepreneur my father was a trial attorney and if you ask me when I was eight years old when I was going to be in my life I Would have set a trial attorney really and my entire life I Lived in that direction and get everything so that I could be a trial attorney\nWhy what but you know was a kid as a as a young child you were fairly entrepreneurial total folks about your charm sucks for\nElementary school you really do research on we try to um I yeah I\nWas very entrepreneurial always I'd love to making money I didn't ever want to do anything with the money but the art of making money was so much fun to me and I would dream up ideas every weekend and I would recruit friends and one thing I did was\nI bought little socks my mother would take me to the mall and then I bought big bags of charm plastic charm and I would sit at home and I would say so each turn on the sidewalk and then go and sell them at swim practice at school at my gym class and that I felt my first\nAnd then go and sell them at swim practice at school at my gym class and that I saw my first you know several you know I didn't realize maybe that was the precursor to be going into stocks and undergarments\nWell something other here it must have had what they call those aha moments I'm In a high school you have several different um ventures going on to a gym\nI did I my I remember that my dad's specifically said Sarah I really want you to learn the value of a dollar you need to go get a job you know immediately and I went and got a job selling a setting up cabanas unclear whether beach I did that for two days I thought it was in a miserable thing heavy [laughter] it was hard\nSo I realized that that that\nUm hotel needed a kids' program and I brought up a flyer that said\nParents enjoying fun while your kids have fun with Sarah and I would wake up in the mornings and walk up and down ... from nine to ten introduced myself and hand the flyer to them and their kids would kinda with ten dollars a child and I held it from one to three every day\nAnd I made so much money doing that\nFor her but one of the genius idea that is amazing I understand you put together a little miniature golf course to and you're all\nWell and that was probably younger than high school but yeah I mean every weekend with a new way for me to make money so I Would make ... Gulf in our garage and I would get little towels and the towels or be the green and I would get things and put it at the end and um rent out the clubs to friends and the balls and everybody would come and do that and then the next week and my\nMy playground would be a roller rink and I would DJ in the corner and charge everyone should that come and my dad always said that he would always be handing all the little kid that their money back as they left to my house\nI Love it I Love it I think those are quoted was either may have been fortunate small business or forums I Apologize for forgetting the source of it but but the court said thinking of ways to make money was a game to me that seems like you had fun with everything you've done so far\nYeah I did I had a lot of fun and I've always loved doing not\nIncredible and you know as we look through folk so we get back from a short break coming up here just a little while we're going to find out that I think it's been a common thread and sort of Blakely is life and if you listen to all the great entrepreneur is we've had on all of them\nIf you didn't have a passion which is obviously part's fun\nAnd love what they were doing they could never be an entrepreneur they never be successful never sustain a tremendous amount of energy that it takes to make a difference and be successful but we get back we're going to find out how in Nineteen Ninety eight\n... Blakely launched thanks for one of those critical moments in her life that she was forced to make a decision and create a product\nWe'll find out exactly what you do just prior and help us build to a hundred and fifty million dollar business today we've got serve Blakely the founder a spanking legends of success I'm John Resnick will be with you just one moment that you\nBuy this is Steve forms of Forbes magazine\nWhen he wants to learn to America's most successful people are reader forms for hundreds list when you want to hear firsthand how they got there and listen to merge and took success with John resident legends of success was one of the most original radio programs in years legends of success was John residents were\nOn legends of success and we're building today was Sarah Blakely who founded a company in Nineteen Ninety eight by the name of Spanx they're doing a hundred and fifty million dollars today there are thousands of stores or it's just an incredible story of tenacity ingenuity creative thinking making a difference it's all here folks\nAnd you've got to hear how this whole thing built I'm Still fascinated and I mean this from my heart's\nIn Nineteen Ninety eight you started spanked but Sarah I Want to listeners to hear what you're doing just prior to going into that business you have to unique you very you know kind of unique jobs is the kind of spin off each other at the list\n[laughter] well I'm I was actually when I cut the feet out of my control that penny as I was selling copy machines and fax machines door to door and that was daytime\nThat was daytime right and then at night I was doing stand up comedy and I'm just I just love to make people laugh so I challenged myself and I was terrified that I was doing that at night\nAnd it's been poorly point you were terrified when was the first time I went on the radio I don't think I slept for two days I was scared to death to live in is the truth or the entrepreneur is me to get out of the comforts of if they want to be successful\nYou have to you have to get out of your comfort zone and wants to do it the first time you do it and you see how your life unfold and magical ways that you couldn't have anticipated just it's almost like you can't go back you have to keep going out of your comfort zone\n... amen you started to get it it's great to just achieve things getting out of your comfort some of his comfort zone complacency is the enemy of the cost of the entrepreneur\nRight and in your contract out you're always going to have the same result there's never going to be anything magnificent are spectacular or something that will come your way it'll be steady and comfortable but if you really want that spectacular he got it you've got to step outside your your comfort zone\nSo Troy Albert largely wants to know which group the exact quote but something like the level of sinking that got you into your problem cannot be the same level of sinking to get you out of it you must elevate you must keep pushing\nWell so anyway in Nineteen Ninety eight ... but I I Love this thing that you're selling coffee or some fax machines by day you're a standup comedian at night both of those must have better knew each other you must have been having a blast\nYou know what they did and it's weird how your life can be laying the groundwork for something that you don't even know is around the corner and it seemed unrelated themed Iran that my family's kind of like okay what are you doing this week and\nI realized that during the door to door sales I did that for seven years taught me to persevere and no matter what that that that that know doesn't mean do you keep going until you find the ads and that helped me with cold calling all the ... and the stand up comedy at night\nI used humor in my marketing and even in the name banks and that I realized if you make someone laugh you get thirty more seconds with them and so I wanted to make people laugh with my brand so that people would want to talk about it radio DJ's news anchors and that's what ended up happening\nA GED credit he told me John I was scared I could read a financial said when the first thing I did was pull the CFO over as I teach me how to refinance was\nSo folks take you're familiar with is jak well to run the one of the most successful corporations the history of the world are you hearing the same thing from Sarah Blakely Sara tell us when I feel is one of the most intriguing stories of hurting for doing this show told me about your cold cold to Newman markers what happened\nOr didn't want to talk about naive okay I think the first call I made with Neiman Marcus [laughter]\nSo the very first call that starring pretty high at that point but anyway I caught picked up the phone and the yellow\nPages called and asked for the ... and said I'm Sarah Blakely if you give me ten minutes here time I'll fly to Dallas I have something I've invented that I Know is going to change the way your customers shop in where their clothes\nSo she kind of laughed and said if you're willing to fight here I'll give you ten minutes I jumped on a plane I took my lucky red backpack from college and all of my friends begged me not to do that\nHow they were like you've got to go buy a product or something and then return it the next day you can't go to them even markets headquarters of the old red backpack fellows but\nTo me it was it was my signature and my life so I had there and I presented to her five minutes into my presentation I just got so nervous and I thought this is my one shot I said you know what you just need to come with me to the bathroom\nWhich is probably should what she said excuse me what do you mean I can you just please come with me to the bathroom on the Amish very my underwear before and after with banks\nAnd I was like a senator [laughter] so you live\nAnd she didn't last and she said ah okay and I did my own before and after four I went in the stall without Spanx on with the regular underwear with my parents came out and said that women have to wear and I went and put the thanks on came out she went wow I get it and want to put it in seven stores right away\nAmazing and so she put it in seven stores\nShe tried it and that in stores John and I immediately called every friend remotely hadn't the seven cities\nBy by by like hey this is fair we sat next to each other in fourth grade you go and buy the product called thanks and act like you've been looking for your whole life and I'll mail you a check\nI Love it love it well you took another step you know what I understand that you weren't real excited with the amount of product they put in those seven stores where you\nKnow I was that they gave me one pocket I didn't even get a whole row I got one pocket and as your department which has the back corner stores it's the sleepy as part of the store\nSo I knew I had to get it out of the ... area because women needed to know it existed and I went to target and I bought a little tiny stands and I went around and ... and Marcus and put them next to every single register with a few thanks in them and every single person thought that the last person approved at\nA bank got away with it for at least a month and a half and by then my sales were so high that when the corporate office found out that I'd done not that VP said let this girl continue to do what she's doing\nAll of a young entrepreneur Z or you're listening to the story of the lady who broke the rules I mean this is absolutely incredible if you followed the status quo if you follow the conventional thinking this we may not be you're going to that\nYeah absolutely if I had just you know and this is also something I Would share you control your outcome\nYou know create your own outcome as a human being don't sit back I mean if I sat back and let them put it in that one pocket and sat at home in my apartment and just you know I Hope it works out at work now you have to create your outcome and there was no way that that wasn't going to fly off the shelf if I had to buy every single one myself it was gonna fly off\nAnd you know something which leads to another lesson and we're seeing the same thing to do the grease or you can never as an entrepreneur allow others to control your level of success\nNever the more that you can set up your own success to be dependent upon yourself and and everything I suggest you do it\nNo question about it this was really truly an amazing story you know and when we come back folks\nReally speak was owed was struck the promise you to be a short break we'll speak with Sarah Blakely as a young child as a young with a youngster she had a dream of vision\nShe didn't know why are speaking to a very famous person she didn't know why she had a vision she stuck with it they're going to find out how how fortuitous\nLife is sometimes where she had an opportunity not only to meet that person will\nHelp put syrup Blakely on the map today just an incredible story about a young lady who started out with an idea and a dream and absolutely didn't take any rejection for anyone seriously and she followed her dream of today sir as a one hundred and fifty million dollar company\nGrowing leaps and bounds the name of the company is spent on John Resnick you're listening religious\nOf success stick around for a truly amazing sounds will just\nListening to my young ones who\nMine down then\nWe are having a science mending visit today was legally the founder of the moon and I hope you've been here from the beginning but I promise you this this will definitely be re run is one of the best\nOf legends of success Sarah discuss this incredible business going but when you were in high school days I Believe it was you visualize for whatever reason that you were going to meet a very famous person and that person you didn't know why but the person ended up changing your life tell us about that would you\n[noise] I actually visualize myself on the set of the Oprah Winfrey show and I got to tell you I was clear is that I saw myself sitting there with her I had no idea what I was talking about I just knew I was there\nAnd I would mention it to some close friends and my family and they would all kind of laugh and go well that's you know that's really interesting and I had no doubt in my mind that at some point in my life I Would be sitting there it was like it was like a premonition or visualization you know I think that a lot of times you just need to visualize where you want to be in the future\nAnd I'm sure enough I was really at a very low point was Spanx I was you know trying to get it made everyone was telling me now and I let go of it and I asked for a sign and I literally just said you know what just give me a sign I mean there's supposed to do this or I'm not supposed to do this\nLet me know and two months later I flipped on the end of Oprah and then not instant she lifted up or pant leg and showed the world that she had cut the feed out of her own penny has to solve her underground initial and I leapt off the couch of my hotel room I\nCouldn't believe it and just said oh my God there's my sign okay I'm going for it and I that's when I went and went in person to all the Hoosier emails\nI Love it I Love it and then it fast forward you end up ... your product ended up on Oprah's favorites list\nYeah I mean I invented it I sent her a gift basket with a thank you note and the next thing I Know I get a call like two weeks later Oprah chose Spanx that their favorite product of their ... putting it on her show\nI mean I'm sitting in my apartment I have no money to advertise that I'm On the Oprah show and then again just recently she's had me on but for the last seven years she's been very vocal about how much she loves banks and that's been amazing from Iran\nIt must have just overnight I Know what she endorses a book it's automatically a best seller your product had to just like I mean how did you handle the volume of calls you order\nBrides a lot of friends with fear and pizza and whatever I could to come to sell orders out of my apartment and I had no fulfillment Center for the first seven months of Spanx I was the Packer the shipper that everything\nWas rich or this is this is tremendous so so that's your Oprah do you also had another visualization or a dream one day of another very famous person who is that\nA Richard Branson I read his book losing my virginity right after college about how he started the virgin brand you know Fifteen and I thought this is such an amazing man a cool guy I I I Would like to know him and I literally\nVisualize meeting him and him becoming a part of my life I had no idea how it's going to happen and then you know fast forward almost Fifteen Years\nUh my staff said there Richard Branson is doing a reality show\nThat is going to be like The Apprentice but take place around the world and he's looking for entrepreneurs and in that instant I already knew I was selected because I had visualize it and I thought well this is how it happens\nYou know not able to do not even when I went through the whole\nInterview process like everyone else I mean they interviewed me ten times for me out to LA and the entire time I knew I was chosen just because of that how much I Believe in my visualization\nWell are always a richer branch was one of the greatest entrepreneurs ever um and I actually saw that show that you were on I couldn't believe it till the slopes where you had tea with Richard Branson half crazy is real love about\nI Know you really are these just a dare devil but what's so cool about Richard disease is basically a hippie with three billion dollars I ever lost to flip flop wearing jeans you know we live this life like he's got twenty bucks to his name I Love it\nBut I scale the side of a hot air balloon at nine thousand feet in the air on a dangling rope ladder took me forty five minutes declined this rope and I had to be on top of the moving hot air balloon with Richard Branson\nAnd there and watch a movie about this low to Richard Branson was not truly be the next ... Barnum but the value will go back to something sure mentioned earlier he does these things to get out of his comfort some to challenge them to do things a little uncomfortable to give them greater ability\nTo do greater things he does he's always lived his life that way\nYou access to the latest most helpful information making it easier for you to make the best possible decision ongoing education reason number seven you should go to certify crop advisor door to find a CPA near you\nSettlements in the corn December down for three Seventy and a quarter march going four and a quarter lower three eighty two and a quarter November to grow up soybean stone twenty two at age sixty three and three quarters January beans Twenty one of the help lower eight Seventy eight and a quarter December meal was so seven fifty a ton of three sixteen twenty\nChicago we've known for five Kansas City don't buy the six crude oil down a dollar a barrel it's sixty eight sixty five for more log on to admit that come on memory Cleveland [noise]\nTalk we want to lose your\nAnother big tumble\nOn Wall street ...\nGallon down one\nPercent get the closing bell down three hundred thirty two points rattled by a variety of factors some disappointing earnings reports ongoing interest rate concerns the trade dispute with China and other global worries including Saudi Arabia\nThe U.S becoming the latest to pull out of an annual business summit in Saudi Arabia fallout from the suspect in killing other Saudi journalist function is Jared ... is live at the White House\nAnd treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin will not attend an investment conference in Saudi Arabia but secretary of state Mike Pompeo is also telling the president to get started leaders a few more days to complete an investigation and the disappearance of journalists in Washington Post contributor ... we\nDo believe that between these two hours a complete picture will emerge for what actually fired upon\nPale made earlier this week with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and turkey each country promising answers could show he hasn't been seen considering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month lease\nThanks Jared and there'd been a number of pull out from that business on that from around the world Goldman Sachs just announcing their executives also will not attend a high level meeting in Afghanistan turns deadly\nTaliban claiming responsibility for the attack and sang it said had been killed general ... the commander of us and NATO forces in Afghanistan\nAmerican officials concern he escaped to unharmed it happened to the security conference in the governor's residence in Kandahar Province at officials saying God to do the people they were supposed to protect\nConscious Simon Ellen in London to Afghan officials were killed the two Americans injured and US military now says the governor of Kandahar who was hosting the meeting in his residence is being treated at a military hospital he was originally reported among the dead\nBoxing [noise]\nTo experience relief for muscle cramps and your legs and feed used their works relieve this non greasy phone has proven to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduced muscles ... their works relieved can also prevent muscle cramps before they start so you can get a full night's sleep without having to worry about muscle cramps\nTheir works relief only six minutes to apply absorbs quickly and it works there works relief as a life changing product and you don't even need a prescription get their works relief today and the pain relief file at Walmart CBS rated and Walgreens pharmacies court their works relief dot com\nWhen the need for senior care arises there is no place like home your loved ones should never have to give up living at home visiting angels will provide home care for your mom or dad at home up to twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light housework\nYou select your professional caregiver with visiting angels look up visiting angel dot com or call a seven seven three seven four live this eight seven seven three seven four Liz franchises are available\nVisiting angels America's Choice in senior home care\nSaid Trump's threatening by tweets to close the southern us border if Mexico doesn't help stop the latest immigrant caravan heading for the U.

then at five thirty five we wrap it up with Doug Schwab the head wrestling coach for the human eye Panthers\nBut it's not like a basketball game where you're right they're absorbing all the noise but I'll tell you what you can hear some crowd noise for sure and with this game in particular it was as loud as I can remember particularly in the fourth quarter as I said it was kind of putting it in the game away I think that that crowd was becoming more and more excited and\nEvery time I was states defense took the field that's when it really really got wild out there and so uh that's what's exciting right now for cycling fans that there is excited when the defense ticks to feel as there are when they're often it's fixed field if not more because that defenses made so many big place but yeah that was\nThat was his charged out as a an environment as I can remember and there's been some good ones in recent years but that one might be right at the top of the list\nWell we've been waiting to really let loose and that was an opportunity to to get it started and will be there the ... the thing you can count on it\nI appreciate it Martin and you're right I think I Would say was due to play well against West Virginia they haven't really played well against them very often in the series and in West Virginia to her last name's there are three previous trips and I wish they would just due to play well against those guys they really did on that night\nThanks dude on we'll be listening okay from you Marty\n... good call Marty thanks for checking in ah by the way phone lines open three one nine two three five Fifteen Fortier toll free eight hundred five eight four Seventy twenty four if you want to get on the show with John Walters the voice\nOf the Iowa State psych lone radio network John I got I got to be honest with you I I'm Upset I I I Am upset that the big twelve\nI don't care if it was a twenty five thousand dollar fine or a five thousand dollar fine or a hundred thousand dollar fine\nI I don't like the fact that they find I was state for that post game celebration by the fans that to me didn't look any different than what we saw when when they did the same thing to TCU or a year ago and and the fans in jubilation came on the field who or\nWhat what went wrong what what did they do wrong what happened I just uh it just seems like\nIt was just one of those kind of spontaneous deals in the ... from what I've seen with Jamie power to set about it that he felt like that I was states administration and in the the security there did exactly what they needed to do I\nI ... it to me it some people are going to use it as a like like somehow it said a negative against that big win and I don't I don't like that I don't like him taken anything away from an upset like that in a celebration I just I'd love to get your thoughts on that whole deal\nWell I agree with you wholeheartedly area um and especially you know the part about it take away from the when I hate the fact that you go out there and play such a great football game as a team wins and all science defense everybody contributing all at least great story lines\nAnd then the headline is you know the the field rush and\nAh [noise] you know ... it's almost impossible to say we're going to keep it from happening I mean how are you going to do that you know and\nUm so what do you try to do is you have people in place to get the other team scored it off the field of safely as quickly as possible and I understand the concern I Do I get it that you know you you've got people that are\nRight up close to these players from the opposing team somebody could say something to incite simply I mean I get how there's a concern there I understand that but\nYou know I think what's funny about it and ironic is that you know the the Fox Sports one telecast the game\nYou know usually when the game and they very quickly say that's going to do it we're names and get it back to the studio you know date wants to do well here they they stayed with it and it showed the celebration for a good three or four minutes and I thought some kind of doing Spencer someone did a great job of kind of summarizing it do\nYou have no chance of getting to an interview on the field or what the swarm all announced they probably couldn't find coach Campbell but you know those guys were saying and their commentary this is what college football is all about this passion this excitement and\nSo they're sitting there celebrating it you know and and I didn't see one upset face on anybody on the field you know I think everybody was having a great time I still get why there is a concern but I didn't think you're I I think you're exactly right it wasn't any different than the celebration after she gave me a year ago\nI'm the only difference was that Gary Patterson didn't complain about it and Dana ... and so um that's probably why the you know they felt like they had to do something in the league office but that's\nThat's life you live with it you will you move on to deal with it I don't know if you can prevent it from happening again because this is excited printed base right now and they've got a lot of reason to be excited and so um I I Love the passion of college athletics I I enjoy\nYou know the NBA and the NFL major league baseball I walked those sports I have my favorite teams and all that I I Love getting into it but there is no way it can never match the passion of college athletics and how excited fans get\nThere really is just something about college athletics you you're definitely right about that John and when you look at the psych when they're not three and three much better spot two weeks ago they knocked off to rank teams\nI really think there'll be favored in five of their last six games the site at taxes best has cycling fans everywhere including the team all feeling good what's the mood around aims to move around the team like\nI think I think you're right I mean there's a there's every reason to think that they could get on a nice round here and I was saying that even before the mistake and if they could just when that Oklahoma State game\nI thought it really opened the door for the possibility of putting together a nice run and [noise]\nYou know they got that job done came back home a work that springboard into a real exciting home game and and I went over top ten team and now the schedule on the back end after a pie week you know you've got some teams in there that you can be you've got several home games for mating and\nYou know there's a lot of reasons to be excited about what lies ahead so um yeah you know it's not out of the realm of possibility to think about the big twelve championship game but I Know that's what the cart way ahead of the horse but\nYou know that things laying out there and and the leak seems so wide open this year and the top two teams are going to advance a you've got to tie breaker over West Virginia and now a hyper raw form a state you don't have a tie breaker which sushi or Oklahoma [noise]\nUm but you know just there's a lot of football to be played it a lot of crazy things to happen and so you know it'd be fun to get in there and then not have to play incarnate word at home on on December first to\nUm be in Dallas instead for the big twelve championship game but regardless of whether it's like when you get there or not I think that ah there's a ton of optimism right now in the fan base got homecoming game coming up with Texas Tech\nUm and as I mentioned a lot of home games remaining on the schedule so uh it's an exciting time right now for ...\nGood time for the by week for the teen John I sometimes for us us radio guys in media we love a by we just to just to get a little uh time off but uh uh would you just soon ...\nAnd I and sometimes for us us radio guys and media we love by we just to just to get a little time off but uh uh ... would you just assume that you're getting right back at it this Saturday coming off that big winner or does this does this by coming to a good time for cycling football\nLet's say I think personally and I I haven't as coach Campbell that but I think it comes to a good time because I I liked the fact that uh the bias smack dab in the middle of the season you know sometimes like every year by and September ... that doesn't do a lot of good um\nIt's a habit you know right at the midpoint of the season I think it's tremendous because you know ... and playing the game on Saturday against West Virginia and neither did ... white as to defensive starters that were out that hopefully you get back with us much time to get a healthy or ... getting closer and closer\nUm but you know when you look at how dominant I was ... was\nAnd then you take into account the two of your better defensive starters ... playing that game it it makes even more impressive and it speaks to the volume of the doubt or the coach ... started to put together with is recruiting where those Jews are pretty good and I've been playing a lot and we're ready to step right in and do a good job in the game but\nI you know I I think the Bible is good and then hopefully um there'll be as healthy as they've been all season going into the Texas Tech\nLet's take one more call John before we have to let you go here and let you spent some time with family or Randy from Cedar Rapids would like to jump on the air with you Randy Iran press wrong with John Walters the voice of the cyclists go ahead Randall air\nWith John the right question it is pretty preposterous that we are being charged twenty five thousand dollars for a band base are enjoying the end of the game but is there a way John that we can handle wide uh West Virginia\nFor trying to ah stop or momentum has every time we got her first and then they had a player down with an injury or which that way they gotta time now and it killed our momentum so how 'bout reversing a fish wasted and we sort of held a on them for\nA a what they did with their injury report just\nWherever they faking injuries John\nAh you know that's as difficult as it is to stop a spontaneous bill brush is even more difficult to prove that the guys and injury so I don't think we're going to win out on\nEither one of those let's keep in mind too that uh you know ever that words was hobbling off the field or is that when I was in that twelve guys on the field what became and\nHe went down like he'd been shot so you know I I I don't think anybody's above the occasional use of that tactic but um you know ... ... it you know I think West Virginia was frustrated I think they were really frustrated with what it was developing I I'm sure they exist spirited coming in there and winning that

mark Farley from six until seven as we spend an hour talking panther football with the head coach speaking of panther football they host the number two team in the nation this Saturday\nIn the unique dome uh two weeks ago it was number one ranked North Dakota state in the dome to take on the Panthers Panthers gave him a great run for three quarters game got away from them in the fourth of this Saturday it's the number two ranked team in the nation South Dakota state\nComes to the unique dome and they've got an excellent football team again this year let's learn more about um as we talk with Tyler marry him he's the excellent play by play voice of the Jack rabbits radio networks tighter welcome back to the show how's everything in Brookings South Dakota\nI don't know if things are good it's warming up a little bit it's been pretty cold but it's actually almost short sleeves weather out here and or or I should ask to stay in the hour things and the Cedar Falls Waterloo metro area\nWe're going to be good a temperature wise whether white today tomorrow but Saturday game time\nThey're talking about forty some degrees and windy so good thing will be indoors for uh the or the elements are no factor at Seventy two and perfect conditions for this uh important Missouri Valley football conference game\nWell looking forward to getting down there should be a lot of fun\n[noise] tell us about this year's team because man I Tyler I look at some of the things that a foreign one record to in one in the league you only last was\nA to North Dakota state by for a game that I listen to a loved your broadcast that game I followed the entire thing and I I thought for a while there you guys were going to knock them off but\nUh when you look at ... almost five hundred and thirty yards of ... per game number four in the nation in that category number two in the country and scoring off ... at over forty eight points again\nThis off the you're bringing into the unique dome talk about\nProlific high profile oh you guys got it don't ya\nWell it it certainly is a very good off that's when you start rattling off the numbers we obviously have to acknowledge that ... played in over matched Arkansas Pine Bluff team and even the four stringers were scoring in that game they put up ... points and had over nine hundred yards all that so that obviously skews the numbers a little bit\nBut still you look at again in ... we play and the the chance hung over fifty on the Indiana State can and put up a over thirty on Youngstown State which is a very good sense it's just an author has only in a while and the difference here\nWhich I Know it's one of the big things last year with God or in a way they can even ... the senior running back there were so many that are in\nTargets for tearing Christian Christian still there is one of the best quarterback from the country at our level\nYou don't have the veteran guys around who are proven commodity a lot of guys who have been good second or third option and now they're becoming number one option so it's been a different dynamic where you don't go in knowing that when it in God or will get all this attention so to get for Wade through and things that's been a ... that's\nLike you said there's been a number of guys that have stepped up at the different off into the stamp was the tight end is not as involved nearly as much in the passing game but very similar and the plays and what they're doing is using different weapons and really it's been sort of a two way adjustments because not only the ... not have those want her to go to guys\nBut chances are defending them differently because in the asked you almost always would try to double or bracket uh when I got her and so that's part of a chess game ... defensively on Saturday and then how era guide to the ... the coordinator and his staff but just to let you went on ships\nAnd you know you lose when you one of the best wide receivers the league has seen in a while and\nGod or to a just a tremendous tight end that that is playing in the NFL right now but you you do have the the top do all of receivers the top and hand them I guess you should say in the valley in ... Johnson and Adam Anderson\nYup ... and they bring different things to the table a Johnson is a little flash here he's had a couple of one hand it catches them probably not quite to the Dallas got her level but certainly he's had some highlight reel grabs Anderson it is more of a of a guy who go up and get all these little more over the middle\nEast still can run would they be used in more with the shoulders throws or Johnson they'll use a little more vertically and they also use utilize him a lot with the jet sweeps you know where you bring the wide receiver emotion and pitch it to him\nAnd then let him with a running start turnouts fields so they use them differently but they both are are solid weapons they use the tax law there ... running back right now as a wall is a senior U.S suffered a career ending injury last week against Youngstown State so they've\nHad to boost some guys around a freshman name's CJ Wilson ran for over a hundred yards on Saturday\nBut again I think such a key part of all this talk about these different weapons the one constant staring Christian if you had a young quarterback who hasn't been around it's probably different story but when you have that veteran presents a senior who's seen everything and he's been everywhere that goes a long way towards helping you with all these new targets\nTell her when you talk about tearing Christian he's really incredible from what you can see so far this year he's thrown for one thousand one hundred sixty yards with a sixty seven percent completion percentage but what really gets me is just touched down the interception ratio is sixteen to one and he had to have taken is passing level to a whole new level in ... [noise]\nYou know it's funny because it was awfully good last year I mean he's been a pretty special quarterback it was the valley offensive player of the year two years ago certainly in contention for that a year ago Chris Straggler of us do you want it and he was definitely deserving as well\nYou know Christian just make good decisions I think that's probably more than anything in the past guys there were ...\nYou want it and he was definitely deserving as well\nYou know Christian just make good decisions I think that's probably more than anything in the past guys there were probably times where Christian would just take a shot and throw the ball up to a win a key or a God or because it's going to NFL potential candidates if I get any sort of pressure I can just take a chance\nHe's not doing that as much this year because you don't have those guys so I think it's caused him to try to be a little more refined not be as much of a risk taker and not that he was a great risk taker like I said because when you're throwing the ball to those guys there's only so much risk there\nBut he could afford to be a little looser now and again\nNow he can't he knows that so he's being a little more careful\nAnd then again being a senior and you just you learn things the game is so much slower than it was for um a couple of years ago so he's just playing that are very high level of confidence right now you can see it nothing seems to rattle him at least it hasn't to this point to and that's obviously a big reason why the jacks have been as successful as they are\nTyler marry him the play by play voice of the south Dakota state Jack rabbits radio network on her village in VIP hotline he calls Jack rabbits football home and away all season long and they had a great run a year ago made it all the way to the semi finals\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we have a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your healthcare you could be massive savings for you the typical savings for family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save and why managed care is so popular go to med a share dot com or\nCalled SARS or aid for eight that star star aid for eight messaging data rates may apply Gulf star star aid for a you're listening to\n\nSpending it down fine Lisa let's ...

me appreciate it\nAlways enjoy getting on where you were yet in the season just\nWorkouts been underway for awhile update us on you\nYou can start a fulltime practice October tenth I'm so we've been doing that you know you do you do your preseason work but um [noise] you know obviously anybody serious about it is is really working three sixty five you know to get better and to to become you know national champion um\nYou know it takes that that type of dedication working our guys have done a good job since last march um a lot of work's been put in\nNot always the work maybe they want to do but the work that's necessary for them to make that jumped to the next level so excited about were added the team and look for to them getting out and getting out and get the you know we're about you know two weeks out from being able to get to see these guys grab a hold of somebody else and\nIn a you know they're chomping at the bit to do it but we're just trying to take each day I guess that's probably the biggest thing for me is that we got to be able to take advantage of each and every day each and every opportunity and make the most of that and then we're going to cover a whole lot of ground if we do that\nAnd I know it's not all about the very first event that you get to wrestle and it's more about how you perform towards the end of the year but uh you do have that first event coming up that the Harold Nichols open on November for that is going to be here before you know what November fourth yeah you're going to be in competition\nYou know what sixteen days so yeah so it's coming yeah we're we're looking forward to getting out there in competing again I Know I'm excited to see these guys wrestle\nIt tell us about some of the guys and I know we can't cover every particular wrestler but just mentioned at least initially some of the key returning guys that'll be your leaders in the wrestling room as you travel you go to meet ... who are some of those key leaders\nHopefully there's a long line of them you know it's not just and it's not just one guy that we can point at a you know ... ... was brought up the other day a he's a guy who Richard last year and able to bring back this year\nThat saw some some girls that was necessary for him to make that jumped to from going around to all of a sudden now you're in the national finals that he's done that\nAnd now it's time to go out and competing and she'll ruin else where we've seen in that room for a long time I'm assigned to show it's time to show everyone else and and you know he he's won\nIt through all Americans that are back in our line up a guy like coach log who\nIt probably doesn't get a lot of publicity because you know maybe because of how he wins it just greedy and tough and he finds ways and and he's a guy that's going to make a big jump this year too just because you realize how good he is he's been in the country at Ninety seven last year and he was undersized\nUh I think other than us and our staff in him and the guy's a teen there was no one else that was probably putting begging him to be\nYou know fifth in the country um we believe that he was capable of doing that and and then he believe that too he's incredibly coach of on and talk about a guy that continues do just a little bit more each day it's not like it's not like he tries to do more\nJust one day it's every single day he's putting a little bit more in and that's where you cover the ground I'll send you look back and I was in five minutes here in ten minutes here and ten minutes here ten minutes here and all of a sudden you've got ... hours hours and hours and hours of more work and that's what ended up showing up you know in March I'm so him obviously max [noise]\n\nSay to say is disappointing last year you know you come out for me in your fifth as a freshman in the you know place in next year I think there's some things that maybe he held onto a little bit that that really held him back in in he's injured even injured knowing we're not going to talk about it he's not going to talk about it I'm not going to make any excuses but\nIt impact in some situations when he's in on a leg max Thompson yeah yeah yeah\nI mean he had shoulder surgery this summer or tried to get through it but you get to a point where you just can't you can't physically do certain things and then it it impacts you and hold you back in and you got to end up getting something done in the end up getting it done and and he\nI think fortunate for us now say fortunate for an injury but all of a sudden then you have to work on some things that maybe you want to spend time on an even for me I mean I recognize that the coach\nWould we've spent that much time on a stance I don't know probably not but it was something that was incredible that was necessary and I think it's going to help\nIt's going to have some incredible benefits you know for him down the line how fosters another guy who's he was an actor in all American as a sophomore and looking to finish and kept things off and got like a ...\nI'm going to have some guy step up and some other ways to [noise] uh I Know I'm leaving some guys out you know you asked about a few of them you know you get ... back and I'm thirty three and we got Wagner back there's a couple of other guys logically looking to try to be the guy elders back um [noise]\nI like when I see not of a of a\nPerson Laura's done done a great job in the room somewhere young guys are doing a great job in the room and I'm forty nine we're not sure when we're going to have max back I'm not that concerned about having him back for the first ... it's it's not the end of the world um we want to make sure that he's ready for them to the season and and if you asked him he's ready now\nUm but the thing is to coach get to the side that uh you know Derek ... is just like his brother he continue to do a little bit more of a day and you know looking for someone to step up\nAnd ... and if I was if I was Derocher\nOr whoever else is thinking about trying to be the forty nine I'd be like I'm not going to let them have that in a spot back I'm just gonna take it I'm fifty seven there's about five or six guys that\nAre going to go in battle for that spot they paint and had some paid and have some time in their last year um [noise]\nIn get some guys that are that are cutting down showing filter or patents cutting down a damn Kelly you know there's a lot of guys kind of looking at I think they're looking at sixty five and he gets higher backing of all I'm going to I'm going to test the waters of fifty seven I'm so we'll have somebody battle tested their six four Seventy four guys back eighty four\nSo you're looking at sixty five and he gets higher backing of all I'm gonna I'm gonna test the waters of fifty seven so we'll have somebody battle tested their six four Seventy four guys back eighty four um foster\nHosted logging and in icy and he started looking at that line up and I know I can I can put a little smile on my face thinking about what we are going to roll out there\nI'm up and down the line up and just having a few other guys that really step up and I think those those guys can feed off each other you know it's time to start things off really strong and and start putting the hammer down from that first competition and and just really really get a lot of momentum going as as a group\nI think I'm thinking entrusted to a guy that's really gonna help set of four eighty four Ninety four Ninety seven even if he doesn't want to get more it's got to be making those guys all three of those guys a little\nBetter here yeah for sure he's credibly athletic explosive and excited to have him you know have him part of the program\nYou know obviously thought that it was the right fit for him from the start and and sometimes sometimes you don't always take the most direct route to where you should be or or need to be a modest he didn't do it he was Oklahoma State the last two years and and uh you know now now he's part of our program and excited ... part of our program\nSome great home of events this year and and this the time to get your season tickets to you and I pay up their wrestling in the west GM just you gotta like the whole schedule more big twelve a dual meets also this year and you're bringing in a team like Cornell in that first the first do you got you got some great whole matches\nYeah could like in a lot more I mean is that there's some other teams that would come interests let's say with it you know it could bolstered a little bit more um\nYou know we've got Nebraska back on the schedule we're going there this year they'll come back next year which is exciting hopefully we can get Wisconsin a back on the schedule you know next year [noise]\nWhen when we have some teams that are for four or five hours away we certainly would like to be able to go home and home with those that sometimes I can understand I Can't understand a little bit maybe that they tend to most he don't want to add us when they have their Big Ten schedule but the way the the way the rankings are\nThe way that you get into the national tournament a tougher schedule the better losses don't hurt you right now so go out and compete against the best competition um but yeah haven't Cornell come in you know obviously the great opportunity have robbed ... back in his dad was a was a two time to time or outstanding wrestler\nFor the national tournament here was a coach here's a legend here you know it'd be it'd be fun to have his team back um\nYou know we went out there last year and it wasn't all\nThat enjoyable a trip but um hopefully we can do that same thing to them but they have they have a really good team back have Oklahoma schedule has always stayed at home\nUm and then fill in with a air force and in northern Colorado too so five home does have liked to have a couple more hopefully in the future we will you know ... Missouri back on the schedule so that's something that maybe you could get to um [noise]\nAbout five hours away so yeah the ... the tension something you get to her going back to ... this year\nThe energy and excitement that people have for the for the program how much they believe in us I mean so that they're willing to give back to us that they're willing to to to do that just commend makes us want to work that much harder and wants us to represent you and I to the highest level in\nAnd look forward to being able to do that throughout this whole season's\n... coming out and joined us after practice today we'll talk lower the Sox yeah yeah there you go and not a home run last night by the way I like all day all didn't I didn't call it a home run our at our and\nGood luck the red Sox didn't or will be in touch with you throughout the season goes will get John ... yet Doug Schwab had wrestling coach for you and I pay up there is joining us live in her village in\nVIP microphone also thanks to Jim Nelson sports writer with the courier for joining us that's a wrap open line friday tomorrow now do do the right\nChoice of eastern Iowa\nTalk seem bleak actually\nTheir words were handlers sports talk we\nPresented by other place on university the drone homo fans are sports talk also by these words like longer\nFears are poised to little benders\nGood\nEvening everybody in a while for them to\nPay their sports talk with goats barley our show is airing live from the other place on university avenue in Peter ... thanks for joining us all\nSo I Would go barley our show is airing live from the other place\nOn university avenue in Cedar falls thanks for joining us all across the panther sports radio network lines as\nThe Panthers are coming off by huge road when last week at twenty fourth Reich South Dakota Panthers when it forty two to twenty eight and now now the competition goes to another level this Saturday for the panther homecoming game\nAs the number two teams in the nation in the south Dakota state Jack rabbits are in the unit don't for a four pm kicked off the Jack rabbits come in for and won an overall to unwanted envy M.

relentless pass Russia they had\nI mean I watch them play number Ninety One Ninety three Ninety five and watching these guys pass rest as hard as it were and play number one two and three so says a lot for a or defensive line and and uh they're planned out a very high level\nTalks about this Saturday's game got the number two ranked last time you were at home it was the number one ranked team now what's the number two ranked team come in in the south Dakota state Jack\nRabbits yeah it's a it's another really good football team and uh you know they are led by their could see their quarterback he's really done ... trying to\nBreak in court record breaking quarterback for him\nAnd uh you know I'm I'm getting choked up or you know he's a handful [laughter] so uh we we've got to deal with him and you know people that have seen us play before drill rainy and Bailey we remember those guys for their speed\nAnd this guy is that type of speed when he breaks away but yet he's got a great throwing a a motion and it really throws the ball they've really done a good job training him and developing him as a quarterback and are really doing a nice job yeah and\nAnd you know they lost got her to the tight end spot when they get wide receiver but now uh they got a tandem of wide receivers that are\nTwo of the best in the league in a ... and her son and a cake Johnson Adam Anderson Cay Johnson looked I I don't know if you can say they just totally reloaded but they've got a couple of pretty good wide receivers for for a this young man a to throw the football to\nLike two really good receivers and and uh they're running backs is is kind of weather\nKnown for because I've always had great running backs up there and and uh the the freshman running back is really doing a nice job for Iran for a hundred and Seventy four yards last week against Youngstown and like I said the quarterbacks throwing the two receivers uh and and they're doing a nice job form they got speed\nOr
