Fairfax, Virginia the great WMA I'll go\nA Mark I'm really thrilled to be on the air with my name is Jay and do a little and my father was a conservative Republican a U.S representative in California for Eighteen years and I remember his name ah the corrupt media the Democrats under Nancy Pelosi\nAs well as a corrupt leadership of the Justice Department I worked very hard ruined my father in our family or they had to fight hard for eight years and spend a million dollars in legal is\nWould remind me what happened\nWell they were my dad was in the Republican leadership and they were friendly with Jack ... and ...\nThese would remind me what happened\nWell they were my dad was in the Republican leadership and they were friendly with jak gave him off and just\nBy a guilt by association they are Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats tried to tried to take my dad and my family down but unfortunately or fortunately excuse me after eight years or putting them severely financially and dad or my parents were able to weather the storm and then come out victorious\nWhere their charges brought against them\nNot a single indictment there were eight years of investigation or put them a million dollars to spend a million dollars just defending themselves like\nImagine ... being investigated for eight years\n... years the the FBI still hasn't returned some of the personal effects are they took from my family so this whole cover up the tuition very much at home to me because\nI Believe they've tried to do the same thing to this good man as this is my father the good news is my dad weather the storm even though my parents were ruined financially they didn't fold under the pressure to admit to something they didn't do and thankfully neither is Kevin ...\nAh the the real reason I'm calling because I never third one bit of about politics\nI certainly never considered myself a conservative but the aftermath of the two thousand and six year lecturing by changed everything for me\nBelieve it or not I was planning on voting for Hillary I Know that sounds crazy but I was thinking that decision purely on how I Believe she presented herself on C. D. during a three televised debates I thought that she represented herself more presidential but that's just what does that sound I'm sure there's a lot of other people who did the same thing\nA Democrats are very good looking polished on television\nThey have a great outer shell with no substance underneath\nBut it was it was after the election I started to realize how group that one side of the media was\nAnd it was this that started the wheels turning in my head\nAnd seeing all the venomous attacks by liberal on social media to force myself and others are for during the out of a different opinion which that's what really energized me to get in the fight and our conservative Republican through and through\nOut really be voting Republican in the upcoming elections I've got to imagine there's there's other people more like me out there people who are getting so much as I fall asleep before the election or people who are starting to have their eyes open to what is happening in our our all ready to get into the fight\nAt this point I really believe this is a fight or flight versus good versus evil in a Republican to stand for freedom and the constitution\nVersus Democrats who represent ... are working hard to take away our individual God given liberty is\nNo only friend while I think you're exactly right and my best to your family I'm Sorry you had to go through that you take care of yourself [noise] M. J. Fort Lauderdale Florida series sounded like go right ahead please\nHi Hi Marilyn how you doing this evening great thank you fight for like you know first and foremost um my son and I just turned

everything you do I have a bad heart but you get your keep a pumpkin oh goodness [laughter]\nAnd so I'm looking for this book coming out my husband's a cop so I Can't wait to this is the great that's great I wanted to ask you a question you were just talking about um people you know like the last two loving women and supporting women and all that good stuff\nAnd I don't think the doctor for its lawyers really care about her care about women because I thought um I just kind of thought with general on a former marine cells I just got along with um General Flynn lying to the FBI maybe or didn't lie to the FBI not shore\nKind of thought he was maybe getting in trouble going to jail and I thought with Martha Stewart maybe not inside of training but I'm going to maybe going to jail for lady lying to the FBI [noise]\nUm if if the less cares about her including the Democrats and all these people I mean it says right here Christine Ford's attorney said they haven't heard from an FBI cabin I investigation why would they want the FBI to ask one question\nIf the FBI ask one question just something like hey do\nYou fly on airplanes she's done she's only jail\nBut none of them but here's here's the thing\nIf you like to the FBI round agree\nWith you but they're not doing a criminal investigation but this is what judge the pollen tunnel doesn't understand or many other people all they're doing this is not a criminal investigation where people you know complete the ... and that sort of saying what it is is they're trying to ask people about the various allegations that were made\nAnd that's it right now the thing I thought\nIn your title Eighteen\nWhat title Eighteen is a big title you mean a section ... housing and one false statements yes\nYeah I mean that's ... that's possible but again they're not doing a criminal investigation they're doing a background investigation of people have different opinions and so forth [noise] they're doing a criminal investigation they would have to be a shoo in letters they would have to go through a completely different formalized process\nUh then they're going to enough they want to do search they get warrants probable cause it's none of that\nWas only understand that if that's what they want because obviously they want to watch the terms they don't care about the client is what I'm saying because they want to think of course we all know to drag it out but they don't care about the victim is what I was getting at\nWe know what they want they don't want this they don't have an hour which I'm so happy for him but I'm so happy for what's going on but I mean I Am just discuss it that we know they don't want Kavanaugh but for them to stay one justice for this victim or the essay drag this out\nAnd then the the way as if you want justice for the victim you go into the Montgomery County police department and you make a complaint and see where that goes and they won't do it All right I'm Jed do get your point and I hope you feel well or giving your week are and I know the feeling I've got one myself but you hang in there\nLet us go to Steve Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer ... to\nMarch first of all thank you for all that you do you and your partner in crime or Sean Hannity I don't know what we would do without you\nKnow you kind of touched on what I was going to bring up and maybe I Need a little more understanding common sense would dictate that they don't need the FBI does not need to talk to the judge or Dr Ford or why not for the sake of appearance and\nTo not about appearances they had a limited amount of time with the parents is not is not going to assuage the left\nIt's just not in so we're on the right we have to start to understand this or we constitutional is it's not about I'm a pass the time the media pacify and the Democrats don't you understand they want to destroy what we believe in\nYes and so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\nThis these are the same people who said the man is guilty it's a job interview and that's in the ... and the and the the uh\nThis is these are the same people who said the man is guilty it's a job interview and that he and the ... and the end that the uh\nThe the due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does anybody really think that it looks better at the FBI interview that to others that somehow you'll bring over Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is a bomb thrower\n[laughter] that's what we're up against barb against truly diabolical individuals so you're not going to be able to tease him under any circumstances [noise] I'll be right back [noise]\nMean here's the truth about most Tom security companies they're like dealing with another bad cable company you spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then\n[noise]\nUh let's go to Scott Omaha Nebraska the great K O I now go hey mark I want to thank you for a\n... show you have all that you are blessed with great election it's a great place to be able to listen to you every day I Want to make a quick comment and that is a the carnage these democratically be on our point thing that that should I'm sure of alerted us to who these people really are as when Donald Trump well\nIf you recall this um\nWas told that hey this guy got old timers or this guy's got a ... member that whole conversation that took about two weeks of our time\nAnd none of these guys ever came out and I apologize ahead expert after expert on TV telling us how I look at these facial expressions of the president hey look at the way he slurs those words\nLook at the way he carries himself this guy's got problems right here we are to your later I'll tell you that this guy is a rock star and a genius and and is is bearing these guys which is very very fun to watch but anyhow\nAnd then they carry four to eight curious force that doctor that he\nThat that was the one that did all this uh\nInvestigation on itself has tried to force truck to go through all the medical hoops and from that and this guy gets left and carnage as well because he came out said that Trump didn't have all the power they use very sounded very held right right\nAnd what I Would have bought Joe ... says it's mad dang is is your conveying as well but ah anyhow that's a bunch of people that were worked with a nobody ever came I Apologize for\nFor saying that Trump was the manager or has all that crazy fiction\nRight they're never going to apologize for it because they never will this is a hit and run bunch\nA hit and run budge now they got these tax returns or from two thousand two thousand one his father's taxes somehow they stole loews or somebody stole them and uh the ACLU isn't around to help the ACLU is thrown in with the uh\nThe tyrants All right my friend thank you for your call let us continue let's see here uh let us go to Ken Long Beach California eight Seventy the answer go\nYes mark I my question is are there any ah ah Senate precedents or any rules of the Senate would allow I'm Dianne Feinstein can be declared a two week we choose herself for many vote because of the alleged\nInvolvement with no they would have to have a financial interest or family member I have a financial interest or something like this you know leaking and letters and so forth [noise] know first of all you'd have to prove it somewhere they haven't proven and although we all know she or somebody associated with her did it but that's not good enough\nSecondly I assume you would need a majority of the Senate you're not going to get the Three Stooges so it'd be a sideshow\nAnd ah my my next question would be if you could give us a sort of a thumbnail sketch of what a what happened with the Forman a Supreme Court I mean as far as voting for now ... around with orange for person sorry\nWell if they vote for to for that means the holding in the circuit court below stands\nOkay and and there's there's the favorite\nThere is no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme\nCourt now there could be so that well I mean that would be in could ever recess\nThere is no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme Court now there could be that well I mean that would\nBe it could have a recess appointment for court wouldn't last very long which is why they don't do it [noise] um do you do is you get a certain senators including Republican senators angry but uh you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not an appointment for a year or two\nThat just you know hopefully something that would be a phone in their side and we need to listen and we need to we need we need to stop\nActing like losers and be on the defense here we need to ram this through no worry about recess appointments and ... and all the rest these people need to be crushed\nAnd so if you really want to do something you call one of the Three Stooges are you'd be polite to them and civil to them and I don't have to be on the air but you should and tell them that this is very very important to you and you're going to be watching what they doing in the case of ... Collins a Jew or you take this very very seriously\n[noise] All right my friend thanks for your call Frank Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the great W. P. H. T. go\nHi Mark thanks for taking my call for me I'm I'm very concerned that I don't think coke understand the impact that this Kavanaugh hearing is having on due process in this country and then go should be we figured out great\nBecause of your process is gone then the country's gone you have somebody who who are here judge Kavanaugh of a crime and rather than the burden of proof\nBeing on the accuser which is due process the burden of proof is on the accused and not only that but now the accuser jets to determine what is\nJustified proof he has a calendar oh that's not good at all the witnesses say that that he didn't do it or he wasn't there that's not good enough we need an FBI investigation that's not good enough and he's not even allowed to point to the inconsistencies of the accuser\nFord and all the lie that no no no you're not allowed to talk to her she's she's a victim mark if I can just go around accusing people you know mark you hate women while I have a daughter yeah but that's not good enough well but I work with the air but that and now it's up to you to prove to me that you don't\nDo process has done and and I don't know ...

you is well I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talk and the truth about what that's about dead and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where capital is facing this opposition\nI think it does a talent and in large measure because the locals are scared to death but\nThere might be an honest look and revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision that was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution but what most people don't understand either to grow the way were\nReversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states\nAnd each and every state would make its own decision now would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it true the issue of person heard\nBecause if we were except the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because there shouldn't be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds or am I going to want you to stay on the line we'll speak all fair but I was doing a little

those some unemployment numbers released today and you've got to go back nearly a half century to look at numbers like this\nThat is correct or Nineteen sixty nine this the last time we had a three point seven percent unemployment rate which is what just came out today down for three point nine percent of the earlier month the number of jobs created it was a little bit less than people expected a hundred and thirty four thousand at the looking for maybe a hundred and eighty\nBut that was largely because of Hurricane Florence which disrupted everything in the Carolinas particularly\nBut the real story was the two previous much Jeff\nUh August or jobs went up from two hundred thousand two hundred and Seventy thousand big increase their\nJuly up from a hundred and forty seven thousand two hundred and sixty five thousand so adding eighty seven thousand jobs that your previous months\nShows the job market really rains quite strong or wages up at a two point eight percent annual rate but I spoke to ... point nine so wages are growing up I Wish that we got a faster than that I guess you might say um\nAs far as the sectors manufacturing up Eighteen thousand a business professional services of fifty four thousand most of the big big area of\nOf the so called ... which is the broader view of unemployment I went up a bit seven point four to seven point five the participation rate are made at sixty two point seven I think that's really quite amazing of staying that high\nConsidering all these people are baby boomers retiring all the time so overall I think it was considered a are quite solid jobs report\nHow sustainable are those numbers so I mean I Know I asked that from a position of ignorance when I have for months but how sustainable isn't as I've heard some government officials say indefinite\nBut I think so to some extent we're running out of work and stuff that's been a problem I mean if if the people who are if the companies could hire people the skills they're looking for I think we would go much lower rate of somebody like six point nine million unfilled jobs out there\nSo but the people just don't exist or the skills that employers neat so that that's the limiting factor really right now Jeff and\nOf course it takes a long time to turn the ship around in essence and retrain or recon figure the workforce in terms of training and in terms of the mindset of people meant something we've discussed on this program or a great deal\nI noticed by looking at the stock numbers yesterday the Dow was down interest rates were going up you said this is what's going to happen give me some details blades\nSo the ten year treasury is up to about three point two percent I'm I set a while you know what I was down to about two point eight that was going to go up for several reasons and that's happening I think it's going to go higher from here\nAnd that is the reason the stock market took a hit on Thursday um because people are concerned rising interest rates will be ... the recovery to some extent\nThey're they're rising I don't think ... that much but the reason that rising Jeff as first of all there's less demand from the two big buyers of treasuries which is the Federal Reserve which is now selling instead of buying and China which had been a big ...\nIt's less demand from the two big buyers of treasuries which is the Federal Reserve which is now selling instead of buying and China which had been a big fire is now I should know seller 'em and they're doing it for political reasons covers another way to get back at us over the whole trade situation\nSo and then so there's less demand this huge new supply we are the the trillion dollar deficits me and we're just going to continue to act\nAs far as the eye can see it showing huge amounts of treasure so that's I think the reason why treasury yields are are rising and they're going to go ... go further\nSo what should someone do if they have been listening to these conversations they've been monitoring things if they have the money that they want to enhance a investment possibilities with what might they do\nLong term treasuries are going to lose and I've been saying this with a with a while I just don't think you want to be and long term treasuries are treasury bonds or funds because as a district keep rising gonna keep losing more and more principal a alternative I mentioned on your show affordable than popular with the stairs\nOr they secured real estate fountains\nAs a way of getting an eight percent ... without having any fluctuation the price shares doesn't go up or down stays uh ten dollars a share\n'em so unlike treasuries where you're going to be losing ... something like that of a website to find out more about that would be secured real estate funds dot com basically they're lending money short term like over a year to commercial real estate projects all over the country\nSo there's a way of getting eight percent without the volatility compared to treat for it to with lots of volatility in treasuries\nJordan good minutes America's money answers man money answers dot com bubble website you can click the ask Jordan button and he'll respond you directly in\nMay talk about some of those same topics that you exchange emails about when he joins us here on can't see out why than local earlier this week right up against the deadline a new NAFTA\nNot called NAFTA the United states Mexico Canada agreement from what you know about this and again we're a long way from\nAn act meant because you have to have three countries through their law making bodies approve it but what do you see in this and either a positive or negative in and of itself and its impact on future negotiations with other countries like China\nLet's put it this way it's a lot better to have an agreement even though it may not be perfect compared to having no agreement and having NAFTA completely ripped up are falling apart which was what was about to happen until Canada came in the last possible second there\nUm there there were concessions made on all sides but more concessions made by Canada frankly had we continue with the U.S Mexico do alone I think it would not have gotten through Congress so this has a chance of getting through Congress to some extent it depends on what happens in the mid term elections\nBecause this is it's a whole long process to ratify a major trinity like this that'll go into next year if the Democrats win the house they may make it more hard more difficult\nUh wanted me to go see some of these things but uh in general it's a good thing I mean we pushed Canada really hard to get this done and they kind of can see that in the end and a lot of areas I didn't want to consider earlier\nI think it's very different Jeff when you start talking about China I don't think China is going to concede even though they're feeling a lot of pain right now I don't think China is going to concede the candidate that\nWe have talked before about how long China can kind of hold out because of the disparity in trade between goods going there versus goods coming here\nBut again from a cultural standpoint it is much different is it not to get the leaders of Mexico and the leaders of candidates a work with the United states on this continent\nAs opposed to China again along with us being one of the top four economies in the world\nIt is well we're asking China to do things\nThat are structurally almost impossible for them to do what we're saying don't invest in their future they have a program called China two thousand twenty five\nWhether investing in robotics and cloud computing and artificial intelligence all the new areas because they want to be leaders that area they're not going to stop doing that you were asking them to stopped subsidizing state owned enterprises this is where they have huge amounts of jobs that are going to do that\nWe're asking them to stop stealing intellectual property they don't even agree they're doing it or am I going to stop doing it so we're asking them for a lot of structural things which I think it almost impossible for them to deliver and therefore my production has been\nFor a while is the full tariffs are going to go into effect on everything coming in from China\nStarting at ten percent now wrapping up to twenty five percent in January and I think that's going to go into full effect China's going to have full time so that everything coming from the U.S\nAnd I think we're in a long term trade war I don't think it's going to get resolved I Wish otherwise I Hope they we could kind of have a concession get lower tariffs but by Ben is on continuing long term trade war\nWhat's your bad on the U.S ... actually coming to fruition and what the timeframe might need for that a lot of moving parts on that three different countries\nYeah well I think to some extent depends on what happens on the U.S in terms of um but I think it will get ultimately approved a some time by the middle of two thousand nine teams there are a lot of moving parts and a lot of people would allow the opinions\nBut again I think it's better to have a deal even I might not be perfect compared to no deal which would have been incredibly disruptive to supply chains of things moving back and forth between us back to Canada or so ingrained it would be just very very disruptive not to have any deal\nDuring good men is America's money answers man you find him on line at money answers done Tom\nYou weren't as in San Francisco right now he is speaking at a conference he does that a lot you can get a sense of where you could hear him in person by going to money answers dot com and will continue the conversation with Jordan did been coming up in our next half hour ... we'll talk about credit card debt\nAnd what you can do to reduce yours can see all news time to twenty eight\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars have some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with socks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nSo the absorption in the fields is not nearly going to be what would be in July and August and so as a result this rain has a lot of it's going to run off\nAnd so that's where you really have to kind of adjust the hydrologist equations which thankfully we don't have to touch that that's for the weather service to take care of but they were quick to point that out in their discussion yesterday that uh that's one of the reasons why they put the flash flood watch out to begin with\nIs the kids run off is going to be unusually high because of the state of our crop land right now and the fact that we're so saturated from September by the way\nThat statistic for Waterloo third widest fall on record as of this morning [noise]\nUm the fall season is determined as September October November two point four inches away from my record fall season in Waterloo Cedar Falls and everything that falls obviously from the rest of this month of November is just on top of that and setting new records every day\nThat's how unusual this and so that's why it's also difficult for me to make any kind of determination besides hey Jeff it's gonna rain next week or because it's so out of the ordinary gets such a weird pattern to be seeing right now it's so late in the year for this\nAnd keep in mind we haven't really had a direct impact from hurricane either this is all happening with just Gulf of Mexico air there wasn't you know a tropical storm that hit Texas and came up here this is all just straight Gulf of Mexico air doing this and really blocking pattern it's not even a hurricane that's done it yet so\nIt's unusual I'll put it that way it's very unusual and it's just going to keep everybody on their toes and I understand people are going to get frustrated and it is what it is and we're all in this together and that's all we can do\nWe know you will will be watching through the weekend and shoot anything severe break out we know that you'll be there on the TV and with us and again Wilkie folks up to date with the possibility of flooding on the radio through the weekend thanks guy talk soon okay sounds great Jeff have a good weekend you do the same TV nine

tonight until tomorrow afternoon actually through tomorrow afternoon now this does include all of the court or in all of the cedar valley and it could be one to two inches of rain by the time all is said and done\nWhat does that include in Iowa Kirkuk Washington low wise that counties also does include you can in Delaware to view bent and Leon Jones Jackson Iowa was Johnson cedar Clinton Muscatine Scott\nAlso Bremer grungy Black Hawk Marshall payment power chic in essence if you're looking at the map\nIt would be the east central third of the state essentially from Marshall towns

Benton county very light also a fair amount of clouds and rains in run the and Marshall county's moving east northeast much of it not yet hitting the ground it is not the most severe stuff that will be coming in later on\nWhich is why many of the high school football games that typically would start at around a seven thirty they move those two six o'clock or even five o'clock so they can get them in before the heaviest of the rain comes in especially with lightning and we're beginning to see a little development between Des Moines and boom and\nThat is starting to fire up so we will keep you

that I nobody comes into the McLeod Center and pushes you and I paint their volleyball around there or at home tonight and tomorrow night it interesting enough they went on the road last weekend in these two undefeated teams\nIn the the Missouri Valley conference and took care of business beat both teams now they're at home this weekend and another a couple of really important whole matches it starts tonight with Illinois state and to the Panthers taken on a an Illinois state team that's on beating in the league just like you and I both\nAre for no uh Bobby Peterson\nHad volleyball coach for the un I Panthers talked about this whole weekend\nMatches against two on beating teams in the league in Illinois state and the Bradley break\nIllinois state Bradley ... this week at home both um undefeated so again we can go up against two teams are undefeated this week\nUh Illinois state is playing some really good volleyball how they're twelve and for right now and there are three three their losses have come to top twenty five teams who they have gotten ... from 'em so they played Wisconsin Marquette in Washington state uh so very very competitive team and a team that just does\nEverything while I often simply they're leading the conference and attacked percentages defensively um they're leading in what they hold their opponents attack percentage to so are all around team and I think what makes him so strong often simply is there a team that all five of their main players are averaging over to kill for that\nBut then if any of those kids are struggling they have a very deep bench I can bring us several kids in that to help them out other center is extremely good also can be very active as well and then the parents simply just do a really good job of putting up a good block and then in the back court get a lot of touches are led by liberal here last year Courtney pants\nOn but one of those teams that um we talked about last ... last week about ... who keeps of all why they try to wear you out a foreseen hitting shots you don't have\nAnd that is definitely Illinois days so expecting a great battle there\nAnd then a Bradley I don't know a lot about them you had to ... except for stats and just no um fourteen and to start um huge for Bradley that just a great turnaround carols in a wonderful job there with that program\nMark there was a lot of early competition this year at middle linebacker jak ... played really well recently does he have that spot locked down to the ... guys\nYeah he's the one line backer that they're pretty happy with ah where he is going to keep them there um they say that again this week he ... he has been good either leader is is that the senior or it's just been chaos all around him now being an out\nFor at least two more it was an injury or thought nickname in Russia was their best linebacker and the first four games and so he got hurt and the last play against Wisconsin so I'm very in a way it's going to get us first start ever um not not ever had to tackle the guys you know he's in his third year you got your one year to play at all last year\nHas played something that you are but hasn't gone to tackle yet so a six different starting linebacker they're going to have the season all six of them had never started again before the season so it's really really strange here for the linebackers about oh I think that played pretty well\nAnd that's good news because that said he at least they got a good defensive line in front of those writers you didn't linebackers and they're going to be going after a true freshman quarterback for Minnesota well what does he bring to the table for the golfers\nWell he's he's a very talented kid these look it up here I'm actually at walk on two which is kind of interesting um but you know I was the raw and coming off really talk for months at Marilyn in Minnesota was on last week too so\nIt weeks ago they got a Maryland on through to fix ... bought one the last ... because ... four times had a little bit of ... I guess I'm told and so uh the the Maryland has this really got out during those first victim game and he was a rude awakening so um it's a good deal for do for a guy when he's healthy um he likes to throw down field it's really interesting uh\nMinnesota has completed Ninety three percent of its passes the wide receiver ... of the nation\nThat so they really like to use those guys and the outside and try to stretch the field so that is going to be a challenge for Iowa started defend that but also I'm not sure he didn't have enough time\nSo they really like to use those guys on the outside and try to stretch the field so that is going to be a challenge for Iowa started defend that but also I'm not sure he didn't have enough time to to throw the ball down the field it gives us the offensive line because that's a big advantage for Iowa\nMark Emmert sports writer with the Des Moines register on our Billie Jean VIP hotline he covers Iowa Hawkeye football or I I Want to go back to coach parents for a minute he said something at a press conference I ... I Believe earlier this week it was at a press conference\nWhere he was almost ... parents ask if you will where he said you know what we got\nWe got a ... I'm paraphrasing we got a pretty good opportunity over the next eight games something along those lines I mean that that's not that's not usually a a place that coach parents goes\nYeah that was very interesting a lot of us picked up on that too that the\nOpposite it got pretty favorable schedule and I think he's pretty high and his team right now and and I think justifiably so we've had a good September um so that is interesting because they do have a chance to run the table here um I think that's like an easy you have to go at Penn State but there were seven games they should be favored in so we could be looking at a time into her eleven one hockey team this year\nPlaying for another trophy a uh uh the Floyd Rosedale tomorrow in ... in Minnesota you know the ... this this is a ... and certainly there are some rivalries fry what in the Big Ten but this being a border battle also this one\nEven though I was seems that kind of dominated this one this is one that the ... do not want to go up in in a not be able to come back home with that that pig traveling with them\nRight yeah it was interesting to talk about on parents' comments he also said that's the trucking in college football he said which is a lot of a bold statement you know I have a place where for trophies [laughter] but uh it is kinda cool like an old one it's a story ... back in the day when both ears are pretty good\nUh this year I don't think that's the case of Minnesota but this will be a really bad last that came out here with an adult because ah they're just have so much more experimental has three three freshman too deep right now they're they're best often something defensive player at both of the season with injuries just the starting five freshman on off as a just a really young team still trying to find itself\nAnd of course Iowa should have the advantage pretty much every position but one thing that's true here that they play a lot of close games with each other these two teams like last year Iowa\nI thought I'll play Minnesota badly but only won by seven so I'm going to get some separation I think that's the key to them they kept for to be at one score gain weight you know on the road because they've got some disastrous results when they when they do that sometimes\nMark is the first road games for Iowa this season and it's just a short bus trip I'm sure there'll be plenty of hockey fans and making the trip up to Minneapolis is there any worry that Iowa might going somewhere you know it's the first road game it's not going to be at the atmosphere like Kenny but is there any worried there\nYeah I think that is really interesting 'cause a lot of pleasure talking about this week to like it's there was so weird that they you know it's October now it's the first time they actually left the state of Iowa I'm you know for home games and the by so there is a little strange I mean not only the first experience and a lot of these young players you know they START I what's our place in freshman as well\nAnd those guys in there but on the road before too and it's a different environment where you are right I actually saw a lot of Iowa license plates and the way up here I'm I'm actually in Minneapolis already that does seem to be a lot of ... traveling north so I think they'll probably be about forty percent a hawk I found the best stadium tomorrow\nAs you prepared to cover the game ... get uncovered anything else about this Minnesota team under coach PJ Black you know the whole roll the vote thing how's that playing out what what have you picked up on a on what's going on under his leadership of of Minnesota golden Gulf or football\nYeah he's still trying to establish something here I mean he he even said a summer that you consider this to be kind of the first year of his rebuilt because you actually inherit some pretty good players last year\nIn the previous regime they had a decent season or about this this team is just gotten really really young in a hurry I mean all those all that turnover off that roster plus a couple of injuries 'em up it's like but nobody really knows quite well this team is yet because uh you know they won three non conference games but the the play\nGreat competition and then one of the road and just got absolutely hammered by by Maryland so I think he's kind of trying to temper some expectations I Believe his comments like I I think he really wants to go for Spanish but not too down on this team because\nThey may go foreign aid\nThat airs that possibility marketing that'd be something that the Minneapolis media would not appreciate that that's for sure but when you look at the ... team what kind of problems could they ties Iowa this weekend\nYeah I think it starts with what they do have the three ... wide receivers and and they go to them are quite a bit I should do about your freshman and not a a junior um [noise] so that's probably I think well they will try to explain muscle they're starting a freshman running back now who was shot to okay games you know typically Minnesota kind of on the ball\nAnd the one thing that's interesting about them as our second the big ... actually I'm all up and kill the Maryland game sort of that they have a unit to control the clock\nWhich will be big for them that they that are in society has a more power to him the some really tough tough mash up for them with a\nReally young offense against what has been a pretty good defense for Iowa one thing I was going to do that was at a pretty good summer Congress that does that can accept the quarterback because that's one thing that's lacking so far this year for the ... and\nUm that's not I mean that one in one year ago so uh that's what they're going to try to ah in this game I was actually much of I'm kind of last year I was going to be those wide receivers against Iowa's quarterbacks because men have news is limited this week with injuries so apply but we don't know how much so that means to true freshman for Iowa makes you feel it cornerback in this game\nYeah I was just gonna ask you about the freshman with the new red shirt rule are there any freshmen on the Iowa hockey team that Kirk parents is definitely not going to be ...\nYeah it's a two guys that just mentioned actually that Julie sprints them in Raleigh moss a bill to freshmen quarterbacks right in last place a lot of special teams also has these time with these guys do this ... third best quarterback right now I got kind of see a lotta time tomorrow what they've already said they voted for games so far and they're Catholic plan and this one so there's no way they're red shirt\nOr are there are a couple of guys that with this new red shirt ruled that they're they're kind of spread out throughout the season that are true freshmen that they may only use them three or four games and and then not playing them anymore and use it as a red shirt year yeah\nI think they want to do that with um Henry guy all the running back he's played two games so far I think they would rather not using the ... swimming that might be killing Martin you always back a hundred percent health which he says he is\nOne guy we heard of this week's will Parker pillows on Wednesday that the ... Johnson and other true freshman defensive back and actually it was some kind of injury Oregon capsule yeah later this year but they really like him and I think he's a guy that might be able to play for games in November ... because he's worked his way kind of into that rotation which I think is\nKind of interesting because that way you know he could still say was Richard and also get a kid you know ...

upset of the number one ranked team in the country tomorrow in the ... in that one o'clock kickoff I I've been on a number of sports talk shows this week talking you when I North Dakota state football including a number of media outlets\nIn the Fargo area that covered the base it and that's that's one of the things that they ask a lot of you know how do you what's it going to take how how would you and I possibly be able to beat this\nPowerful North Dakota state team what the what can they do he like does not that mobile of a quarterback\nWell well here here's what a here's what\nA couple of their ... a a a a radio sports director down is ... and Jeff ... who is a a sportswriter for the Fargo forum this is what this is their feelings on the panther quarterback Eli done\nHow he lived on his back for his third year as a starting quarterback for Northern Ireland he's had done his worst teams I think it's the worst games against NDSU as first started to thousands sixteen last year Jeff Levi Jordyn Titus school record if three follow recoveries\nHe was picked off four times one was a term for a touchdown Robin grizzly that want to re hear that changed all met them in the game or eastern state got picked off twice in the first had done this had to miserable days against the ... and why is that the case\nSouth Dakota state and tearing Christian and NDSU in east mistake they were two quarterbacks down who were like are like they're both Ron passing all threat they have good arms like seasons ... get up a little bit but that can also make plays with her feet\nNow here comes Mr done and it was a good thrower he's throwing quarterback completing fifty nine percent of ... passes I think you'd probably want that all the more but the guy had minus Fifteen yards rushing season and that's not going to cut it when you're playing a team with I guess good at all of all of a defensive line as North Dakota state has\nEastern stick on the other hand he needs to turn a Seventy one yards to become the all time rushing leader for a quarterback in Missouri Valley for Congress has has while you know I've done as as anything by house or if it's a thriller contrast quarterbacks this week\nAt you and I didn't have to overcome the fact that you are done just cannot run they're gonna have to find their running game they're they're running back why mailers guy I Know there's a big news have average more than three points they had to carry that even that he's doing right now so they're gonna have to find a running game somehow some way\nI Hope he liked Denis heard this that this is how he is a critique assessed as the when I paint their quarterback because I I I Know he liked ... not a true running quarterback\nA but I ... don't be afraid to to throw a little trickery in this one tomorrow to open it up why not Exxon\nI said to coach Farley too and he was talking about how how he likes the progress of the often see blind so far this season I said coach that means you also have to be please with your new often the blind coach Ryan client and\nA very places Ryan Ryan Ryan has has done a great job force [noise] uh I watch them on the sideline I listen to him on the field\nAnd I always love to see how players respond\nAnd get them to respond to and get them to play has a great demeanor and yet he can get on the field and actually show them how to do it as much as tell them how to do it and I think we really needed that in the office of wine because I see a great connection there from what I've seen even as I'm watching him on at Indiana State the sideline [laughter]\nThose things are all invisible to me I'm I'm always taken no to my head of what we need to do better and was going very well and have compliment him out of that I thought that we have those guys during the game is just an important now handles among practiced\nLet's talk a little bit more to about the quarterbacks Here's Mark barley the panther head coach when he was asked about east than stick the starting quarterback for North Dakota state and what makes him so good what makes him so effect deep [noise]\nUh he's he's a winter I have a nice place when ... too I mean that's [noise]\nIt's very similar to our quarterbacks have had their when you go back and look at it is [noise]\nIs there often is that most of the chains and and and faced in is he's a he has the capability of getting out of the\nAnd be with his feet and I think that's what makes him the most dangerous [laughter] for a long running the office they often says what you're trying to [laughter] when you place to stick to the office I think he has a\nDisability they get loose [laughter] when you do have everything covered while that he can get away and even when you get a regime get away and I think that's what makes him\nA dynamic and successful\n[noise] ah Chris climbing the head football coach for North Dakota state was asked are you anticipating seeing both he like done in ... in the house tomorrow you think the Panthers used to quarterbacks in this one\nNo I think we'll probably see done I think that's the that's who will end up saying I'm sure we'll see a bunch of wild cat as well um but uh I Will be ready for both but I think it's probably ... or a game to handle\nExcessive out and he's not a ... a guy by wars why you think that that is a successful match for you guys have had the last two years against him\nWhat we've played really well the last couple of years against him in the first time I think when we were down there may have been as first started I don't remember him and uh and so that would be an advantage to us um it was probably difficult for him in the in the Fargo don't be in the first time in here or he's much improved ah I I think\nYou know he throws out really well these last couple of games that he's playing with a tremendous amount of confidence um I knew him coming out of high school I'm a big fan of his I think he throws the ball really well he reads coverages and stuff well um and he's now into a senior year and I think the game slowed down for him so much ah\nI Know it will be a big challenge for defense of guys because they have really good weapons at tight end and it wide receiver and we have to a great job recovering\nYeah I think it's pretty fair assessment from from coach climate talking about you and I pick up their quarterback Eli done are showing him a lot of respect in in ... ill I got some good targets to throw to Bradley more that tied in spite I I I look for him to\nTo have a good game tomorrow we need him to make some big plays Eli is missing another capable tight end\nI think we're seeing some of our wide receivers now come into their own uh it's it's gonna\nDepend on protection up front in the past in game ... has to have time to to get the football out and uh if if the often the wind gives him time the passing game will be there also as we said\nGoing to have to be able to run the football\nYeah and you know you're talking about Bradley more that man if he gets the ball and he has a chance to go out of bounds or run over someone or get in and out of ten times is going to run over someone ya so amped up for this game he loves this type of stuff and he's that guy out there who has just that swagger too it's not cocky\nHe's got the swag to him he loves playing a big football games he'll be a huge target allies missing is really coming to his own the past couple seasons the receivers are starting to really show it forever Allen's threat out of the backfield to catch the ball so there's a lot of weapons gotta use them got to show up to play into it can be a lot of fun\nCoach Farley was asked at his press conference what what will be important for your quarterback Eli done to to do heading into this one on Saturday\nThroat to the guys with our jerseys on\nA [laughter] a\nBrace at places [noise] now he doesn't [noise] you know I just need to [noise]\nStay within the

again we played every day in the afternoon\nDo anything extraordinary I've always said you can make every cell has just go go play the game and we played every day in the afternoon and don't worry about your player where he plays\nAnd a plan I think he's done that's the last few weeks so he's been much more consistent much more calm but this will be tested because they'll turn to hate upon it [laughter] they always do so you know his his approach at the same way\nCoach Farley showing a little bit of sense of humor there hey he like just throw it to the guys with the same color Jersey on as you throw it to the guys with the purple shirt on and will be just fine nice to nice to hear coached by laugh a little ... and the pressure week yeah like\nThis week we'll talk more about it stay with

weren't focused before we got to wrap up here and go to Chris Klein on shows and talks of you and I paint their ... you you've played in this game before you've been on the field with this panther team you've traveled to Fargo you've been at home when North Dakota state came into the unique don't just\nGive us a kind of your final thought a\nOn what you and I have to do the keys the things that\nThat this panther team needs to do if they want to pull off the upset tomorrow the number one ranked team in the country will\nNever wanted it's a huge game everybody knows that we all know this is the number one team and that's yes football the sixth time national champion in the last seven years which is absolutely ridiculous to think of the success that they've had\nBut this this week at practice was probably very intense and they were very locked in you're probably using all twenty hours available to you um they're probably getting ready to go to their team meal right now where oftentimes you to show a little bit of the past games with North Dakota state and how hard hitting it it and how intense it isn't it it's it's a different level\nOf hitting it really is and if you want I Want you to be successful in this game they have to match the physicality\nThey have to somehow some way slow down the north Dakota state running game which is really hard to do but you gotta do it you gotta stay disciplined don't let ... be the winner he has some way somehow we always finds a way to get things done don't let him run for twenty two yards on a third and Twenty one see things like that\nAnd it's they have a six don't turn the ... last year in North Dakota state it was seven to seven and half time\nIt was like fourteen to seven there for a little bit and what happened six X. three ... two interceptions things like that\nOr just killers it killed ... kill the drive kills the game and you see what happens to just take care of the football that's the biggest things take care of the football do your job don't let it get any bigger than it is and just see what happens at the end of the day but I leave it all out on the field\nThis'll be the third time you've been close to this matchup you and I North Dakota state two years ago in the dome last year at the Fargo dome how do you light the match up this year in the Panthers chances to win the game this year this time around how do you feel about\nNumber one I Love it that they're at home that's a big advantage especially if you and I can't come out you don't come out then it's really not a home field advantage so you need to come out support get louder I'm number two I like the way that that you and I defense is playing right now they have a lot of confidence critical Arabic slipped great Giovanni ... really come to his own is free safety Corby done a nice job there too\nThat front that front of Enron and and the defense the lines of lines been incredible ... pops and a great job and they're huge tomorrow the absence of lying looks good if it's going to be one in the trenches it really is they got one in the trenches\nIt's going to be a tight game I think there's going to be some ... ... so so make your field goals adult be yourself I don't think northern Iowa beats themselves tomorrow got the one thing I don't think they beat themselves I just don't\nYou got to win the special teams game ... it was ... goals with the return game no no mistakes in the age of ... during his coat back tomorrow\nWe'll have to wait and see if he back there or not I ... I I Do think I Do think there's a chance but the ... I think it's a game time decision and I think he's close ... ready to go um well we will find out\nThe first time the Panthers have to try a punter out there and it may have to do with where the right on the field to great point but we'll see should be fun should be fun again catch the play by play right here on this station the flagship station for you and I paint their foot ball\nAll season long news talk Fifteen forty ...

crap [noise]\nYeah you're [laughter]\nYou're thinking of the folks who uh stepped up in a surprise is awake Lindsey Graham at the Atlantic and been in the DC on Wednesday we'll\nBlow yourself after he is funny because here you had Cory Booker ... and and he told us he was having his four to ...\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like actually was born and gives up the hearing and he's continued it's kinda like Lindsey Graham is like the Grinch in a difference and you know the Grinch is hard grew three ... three times a day at let's say that ah Lindsey Graham's intestinal fortitude grew three times\nOver the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\nBuildings I Am very much based on information on the arguments the information that provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always tracked on Supreme Court nominees and you you may be a bit whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd what was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination but President Trump we had four percent more Americans\nSay that he should be confirmed the not the case of that the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus do what they did\nComing out of that four percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months when by the by the fact that they uh you know what else forgets on them and then change public opinion at all not at all\nNow is interesting because as consistent as I was we did see with Christine forwards allegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning not yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory on Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw about what's in the mid shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be again prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media\nAnd the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh where are we today that's kind of interesting by a forty six forty five margin\nAmericans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed now they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first is public opinion despite all the emotions oh the emotions the old enough and throw sport it gets to Christine for two gang raping\nWhatever public opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom asset in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounced back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen near\nBy a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance to the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is it's like a graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably allows people in your life that oppose you right how's that work out for you and let me ask you for the\nAngry leftist but you argue politics worth you ever get anywhere or you just get angry do you think they're one of the folks just pour that seven percent that was ever persuadable and the first place [noise]\nNow I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they're in their lives and our universe\nBut he wants to be open minded person\nComing up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive\nAnd who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy I Am Brian mud man\nThe gray one more glue them around\nFor Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nAnd I have not blame them right along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah and you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change Obama probably made sense because hey that was one of our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it\nRight now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people especially younger adults that\nNow do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right there is getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this ... situation to articulate walk down the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of the sexual assault without the awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad\nRight I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know Kevin all anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience so that tells me why mark what attracts you to do is show\nThe three of you and I wanted to say that uh I live in a very carefully to the uh [noise] there was a a a colon senator Collins is a [noise] a\nDissertation about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite impressed by it she laid it out very precisely [laughter] she was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and build the what they do or do you all the time [laughter]\nThan getting a\nComing of her up a conclusion with all the interviews he did and all all the meetings he wanted to and so I found it very at applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me [noise]\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this process I mean she\nWas on ... ...\nAnd point by point by point from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations who are going to oppose\nRegardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations and even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned that even senators got out of hand and one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that they were opposed all the way through\nBy point by point wind Christine Ford was not credible in terms of her allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been\nThe top attorney in the country the way that she laid out\nThe details as she found them\nIt was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must have you if you missed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing gay was captivating and again I have\nNever heard a senator deliver a better speech not ever I didn't agree with absolutely everything she said money was principles it was details it was well thought out and almost everything there was inarguable I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWhom goes down to money to go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nHey Brian thanks a quarter to a premature echo what the last caller showed up about my respect and admiration for senator callers I mean it's increased by water or cold after work who are on her out of work for about ten minutes after that I knew her vote was going to be a fair trial sticker driving down the road\nYou know the only other thing bigger than what Susan call hosted a today was when the twentieth from Maine Josh what Chamberlain protected their luck ... your your army Gettysburg little round top costs preserving the junior so am I really admire her and I'm Glad she do what you did\nWell that's a pretty big moment uh in the history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way a how are the folks in in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] oh yeah there are other skaters are kind of a ramp butter and big bucks a a sort of the cold weather gets them down here I think er I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington\nRob over in
