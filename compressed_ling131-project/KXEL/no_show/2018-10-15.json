... press row\nNews talk being forty KFC ah\n\nAlmost every one was a winner or over the weekend in in a division one college football in the states but Drake Bulldogs who some of the bracket the colleges were projecting to be in the playoffs this year representing the pioneer league in and they're not out of contention yet\nBut they they got upset over the weekend and it was a rough\nWay to get upset sports guy who just think of this they score they go up Twenty one to Seventeen Seventy six yard touchdown pass\nEvent the winning drive for Stetson they fumble as time expired but then Stetson picks up the fumble on the drink eight yard line and carries it into the end zone after the Drake defense sop they made the game winning stop\nWhat yeah\nI it took me like twelve times read to figure out so that is driving tricks on defense time expires drink thinks they get to stop there's actually a fumble no step Harry's at the end of the end zone\nAnyone you cannot lose a game any crazier than that right there you think you've got one you get the stop but there's a fumble on the play defensively you're celebrating thinking the game's over but the balls loose in a bumble situation\nThe Stetson often picks it up and they they they pick the bubble up and go and score the game winning touchdown and when twenty three Twenty one yes that may cost Drake a playoff berth but here's what the Drake has to win out and they're going to have a big match up with San Diego\nI was on on David Montgomery and when you can't put all loving eyes on Montgomery thirty two dozen opportunity to do some special stuff and I think that's what he did on Saturday Night and\nYou know then when you've got thirty two uh\nFifteen like you mentioned he's capable of making some pretty crazy place and the guys that you throw into football to are are capable of making some pretty crazy place and uh just this kid's ability to run the football his willingness to stand in the pocket and take the hit you know it it's opening up everything for Iowa state's office and right now we've we've kind of seeing this\nAh this this box of of what we thought this team could be you know and if there was a a Pandora's box I guess maybe it's opened up now and a ... pretty lights were were kind of the key to to get it done\nThat will be granted out is the second best pass or in the nation against the against pressure I Believe it was going to pro football focused but I think the real\nWinters here in this whole week we're the ones the defense and John he kept West Virginia average forty one points per game coming into the game\nThey were held a seven point and they were wanted ten on their down there over fifty percent of the year David Montgomery had more yards and West Virginia's entire off and they pointed twelve times in the previous five games they planted eight times against the cycle how dominant how impressive was it to watch the ... defense get\nThan it was incredibly impressive West Virginia you didn't have a single drive that was a longer than five place\nYou know they score the one touched down in that one touched on same as a a product of an interception that you know set the mountaineers out deep inside of I was just their territory and the last time West Virginia reign of play inside the virus they territory\nWas the touchdown pass that ah Wilker through to David cells with about six minutes and thirty five seconds left in the first quarter so for three and a half quarters\nWest Virginia did not cross the fifty yard by\nThinking about that for a second I mean this is one of the ... have been one of the best officers in the country or to start the season I was the defense did not not only did not let them reach the end zone they did not let them crossed the fifty yard by I mean they were absolutely down from basically beginning to end seven ... nine tackles for last\nYou know we'll Greer was I'm In complete disarray for the entire game if he wasn't on his back you know he was\nRunning around just trying to find any kind of opening against our states secondary that I\nAbsolutely did not exist and the crazy thing is that they did it without perhaps their best player ray Leno who was out with a concussion and one of their starting safeties in Lawrence white but you slide and you slide the Andre pain has been you're starting quarterback for five and slide him back to safety which is where he played\nHis first season or our state and twenty sixty\nYou and then you were in ... to freshmen Richard freshman Detroit and young and arch\nExcusing a true freshman Anthony Johnson ended that other quarterbacks pot and they were absolutely terrific you know what I mean the difference was just a plate as as well as I've ever seen it which is crazy to considering what they've done over the the last year and\nUm I think that was probably the most dominant defensive performance if not in recent memory it it's up there as one of the most dominant professor performances against a really good teams in the history of our state football\nYeah as good as the officer was you gotta you gotta salute that deep and survive with state what they did against a a really good ... at the mountaineers\nTook into jak try stadium and just couldn't get anything going we're talking with Jared stansberry he's with psych loan fanatic dot com uh read their work covering not only cycle and football but cycle on sports in general do a great job psych loan\nFanatic dot com or Jared I'm just from the cycle on side of it maybe your perspective\nHow frustrating wasn't after the game to hear their head coach just not it from what I gather not be able to compliment I Will state's effort really hardly at all and and and complain about the the field storming by the excited cycle nation at the end of that when\nI'm through my words carefully ah [laughter] I think that the way they do hold her son has acted in the almost you know forty eight hours since that game drought over is\nI'm as unimpressive is I've ever seen a head coach act after losing a football game or the things that he said after the game on Saturday you know\nYou can think whatever you want but you can criticize your team you can fit your team quite as bad as you want you know if you want to think that was the worst off as a performance rather soon enough but to this credit in my eyes what I was ... that is a defense when quite clearly I think to anyone who watched that football game\nYou could say that that the mistakes a lot in the mistakes that West Virginia and made or forced they're forced into by what I've stayed ... defense and I don't think that he acknowledged that I think that um\nFrankly I think that's a little bit disrespectful to a program that has earned more respect than that in my eyes that's just my opinion but then you you talked about the fuel stoning thing\nYou know to to call it the way I Wish they handled it unprofessional ah to here you know just some of the stuff that he has said about that type of situation we already knew were big twelve with looking into it all he had to say was you know I didn't like it\nBut that's not my thing I'm going to let the ... the conference handle it and it'll move on but he didn't do that a and for a guy like that to be\nA criticizing professionalism considering that\nHis team walked out onto the field chasing a swear words at fans\nIn the state of the ... you know a hearing some of the things that were set to members of our states tuned by players on the field uh I I think that that's a living in a little bit of a glass house like that but that's just my opinion you know data hold her son\nIs a guy who has a reputation as teams have a reputation and I think that over the last few days we've been able to to come to a clear understanding of of why they hold that reputation\nWow so you're saying the west Virginia players prior to the game came onto the field together and we're seeing a explicit of a ... words at the at the cycle I'm proud\n[laughter] yeah rather water it's creating it then what I understand it\nOr not words that are obviously say for the radio but ah they start with after more\nSo than our home my goodness wow well yeah that then that makes it just that much more a special to knock them off when they go into a game or acting like like black ... drink before I let you go real quick by week this week comes at a good time you wish they were just kept on this\nMomentum ride and had to play this week how how does the by we fall and man when you look at the rest of that schedule\nLooks pretty ah opportunistic to have a great run that you've got you got seventh right in Texas that will be an extremely tough road game but I tell you what the everything winnable really the rest of the way with the way the cycles are playing Jerry\nYeah without a doubt I mean I think that this ... does come at a good time you know they've got Murray obviously missed the game last week comes back and plays that maybe the highest level we've ever seen him play but we'll give them another week to rest\nThey've got Murray obviously missed the game last week comes back in ... that maybe the highest level we've ever seen him play but we'll gives him another week to rest a ... a week to that kind of digest what's happening in his first two weeks or a store and you know the primary quarterback ... get re Lima back\nTwo weeks or two weeks from now in Texas that comes to to spur what should be a a pretty big time game and\nUh you know just let everybody feel a little bit first stretch from that's going to be really important you know you talk about all these there's been wonderful I don't know I don't know how to feel about that Texas game yet but uh I I have a feeling that our state will be assuming the way the way they have put dust bar or at least I played the last two weeks\nI feel like I said it's going to be favored or it was close to being over ... there's been outside of the animals Texas and a five and one stretch to end the seat and I think this is a is it will you know it's terrible for the cycle it came and in fact that says this could turn out to be a pretty special to you have\nThirty seconds left mark how 'bout this coming Saturday game against Maryland [noise]\nYeah Maryland a very talented team are very young but they've got a lot of good balance\nUm opposite they beat Rutgers but everybody beats Rutgers so it's hard to know what to make them so far but foreign to their their early the losses to Michigan though I think it's a pretty good test it's a it's a team I think a little bit like Indiana what they're going to your ... and if they're especially in their one

about\nPolitics fine I get up in there when you're talking about there is no middle ground we have to win that's why I keep saying the new rules are in effect and Trump gets it they have to lose and we have to when we need to exercise raw political power\nTo keep these people on the radical left for taking power because they've shown no evidence do handle it responsibly\nDon't go anywhere because later in the show me to talk about new developments on the the Spygate thing that broke this weekend representative John Ratcliffe gave a explosive interview on Maria barter robo about ... exculpatory

from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new genocide sunspot correct ... she wrote I Love the genocide sunspot correct there it is might go to products every day I have sun spots and age spots and can see a definite difference of my skin since using it as just like Rene\n\nThe top one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load than the\nBottom Ninety wiped out how is it fair share if that's not you know what I'm ... there's more of a citizen just that there's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg\nPeace again not a some right wing website here\nI mean your son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberals listening it'd be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from boomer okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the\nBottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is this so sensitive to make us liberals are fraud they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes what if we at Al Sharpton is tax debacle we have ... you know Bernie Sanders what do we find that he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example we by the pool if you believe in what you're saying there's a park or see here for Republicans we think taxes suck because we think outside of our\nMilitary and our courts you flushed down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste it which you prove us right all the time\nWe would rather donated to charity and let the free market and ... and charities handle it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big tidy ball flushed and you flush it down to ... and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise that all\nTheir share not out they don't they already paid to us cut their taxes let them put their money to work in the economy grow jobs in the economy yeah why do you like them apples how do they taste\n\nI got some more numbers we'd be maybe after Sylvia where does this come from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component with Trump how he didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment\nThis is the first year of my life that my wife and I really you've done well um my show the book things just did well they did thanks to a lot of you by the way but things just did well I mean they'll need to go into the details\nBut talking to my account and I was absolutely floored I could really couldn't believe it when we found out how much money the government\nI was astonished I really was that will be fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for we don't we don't live a frugal lifestyle at all I mean excuse me a spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda without cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot so we don't get to go out\nI'm telling you I was lord I thought he had a decimal point wrong\n\nAnd I probably have straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island play straight so whatever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law stinks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was for this was the first time my life I thought to myself I'm Serious folks\nAnd my wife is probably going to kill me for talking about this but it's okay I made it because I think this needs to get out there\nI grew up at the low\nEnd at best the middle class and I'm being generous 'cause I'm not I'm not a sob story the low end of middle class at best\nOkay like at one point the bologna for dinner kind of you know what I'm getting university where I'm getting out of their middle class like yeah we believe me steak was not I was a hot commodity mind and what it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis okay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go to\nI worked my butt off where there was that the police department it in the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service\nAnd you finally get to a point in your life and for the first time you make what could be legitimately life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them are so yummy we're going to be able to do I don't want to be traumatic about this\nBut you think to yourself I got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C to do was to do what\nAre you serious to do what I don't mind if I can I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role of government I military guys take my money [laughter] is\nWe need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but he worked flushing money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe mean we ... we need seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they're just burning it\n\nIs the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and it said I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrats in the sea to flushed down the toilet bowl\n\nThe worst unbelievable and I I think it's because I grew up\nAt the lower end the middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class later on I guess I mean I don't know\nTickets because I grew up at the lower end the middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class later on I guess I mean I don't\nKnow I don't know what the categories Arnold care making them I Try to make the story more dramatic and it needs to be [noise]\nBut I guess it's not a genuine we respect the dollar because I Know what it's like and then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over\nAnd they just mega amounts to the government for me at least probably enough for anyone else who's really rich which I'm not but I just I'm paying by every ounce of it it just sucks so bad\n\nBuild my business everything we could hire new people to write for the website ... and we can't 'cause I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C\nTo burn All right so I get off track you can tell I'm kind of hot on this topic is another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we pay\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers top fifty percent\nPay Ninety seven percent of all income taxes ... percent the top fifty percent of earners pay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar in taxes\nNinety seven Ninety nine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter it\nMatters folks because the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers logically then pay three percent if the top fifty pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than about fifty three percent of the ... so this Bloomberg\nPeace they did an interesting analysis they said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest end or is this all makes sense for the second I process what percentage or number of the highest and earners\nAlso pay an equivalent three percent of the actual like the bottom fifty percent of the errors in the country ladies and gentlemen the evil rich that the left talks about the Bernie Sanders types\nI'm using their terminology show how the pure stupidity of the comments you're never going to believe is the top ... euro zero one percent of income taxpayers in other words just fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one comma four zero zero for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top earners in the United states\nPay the same percentage of the tax load at the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in the country\nTell me again please with a straight face\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share fourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or at the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or I'm so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax or as the fifty percent at the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing now you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely you're in it for the rich no no no\nNo no no I made it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair share is\nFair shall we usually make as his doping stupid talking point rich don't pay their fair share they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of fired up
