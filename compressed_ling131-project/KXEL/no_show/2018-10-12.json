mentality with me too movement like having a mob mentality when I say that you can't you don't need evidence before you say someone has a rapist\nThen heard isn't going into the market then we'll be right back around\nAnd listen to what David as from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at

been targeted I've had to use my gun to protect myself a I've had a significant number of legitimate death threats I've had people who've come after me and my family um ... that is the intolerant and left\nThey will come after you with everything they have a and and and there are no rules anymore and and and Brett Kavanaugh's proof of that when I say there's no rules anymore what later to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh by saying\nEvery day every day it was something else well he's you know he he he didn't write me but but he planned rate so then he was he was involved and gang rights didn't game right me but he was playing the parties again rainy well then I think it was a gang rape is any drinking college any drink in college and I think the game right people in college\nI was actually it sounds to me we didn't actually sounds to me but he might have been reading when other sexually assaulted me\n... to put somebody or for traveling all who is the perfect drama I mean there's the his above a marker him Korean or a person or I'll bet on those high school or college in Ireland\nI don't think he will have to say I think he was probably a jock\nWho was the captain of teams who drink and party with his friends and that doesn't mean you're a rapist yeah you know and and and today it was interesting because on the view today they were having a conversation about this and you want to talk about mob mentality\nUh and and and I we I appreciate the phone call but they were talking about this mob mentality Abby Huntsman uh was defending Maloney as me to comment saying call for\nEvidence and and the view show exploded around her\n... a lot of the Trump talked about the me too movement and she said you know in this exclusive interview with ABC News that she stood with women and the me too movement but added quote that we need to have a really hard evidence\nThat if you're accused of something show the evidence you cannot just say to somebody you know I was sexually assaulted or you did that to me because sometimes she said the media goes too far and the way they portray some stories it's not correct It's not right and I agree with millennia\nWell you know the view of course took on Trump's comments and and sunny house and took a swipe at Trump claiming that the first lady is telling women everywhere your word is not\nEnough um that's that's not true I mean\nIt's\nCan support the me too movement while also saying that we need to make sure that the me too movement is held to a level of accountability that our court system says his is adequate incorrect that you must have\nEvidence you can't just destroy someone's life you don't believe me look at the kid whose parents are now suing a five a high school students who\nHave evidence\nYou can't just destroy someone's life you don't believe me look at the kid whose parents are now suing a five and high school students who uh\nFalsely accused their son of sexually assaulting them destroyed his live destroyed his friendships destroyed his entire\nLife they everybody's walking around saying and then they finally recanted their stories and they're suing as they should\n\nThere are people you know there was this or a football player recently there was a ... film I think it was on HBO down about him he went to prison missed out on the best years of his career because he was falsely accused of raping a girl and it came out that finally that he didn't rape or\n\nWe should believe in the presumption of innocence over guilt but the mob guilt but the mob mentality of the left is if you are a woman you must be believe no matter what and the man is guilty automatically\n\nUntil he prove his innocence if that's not a mob mentality I don't know what is\n\nYou can go out there and can accuse somebody of doing I mean Abby Huntsman said that they evidence should always matter\n\nEvidence should always matter I had no problem listening to Mrs Ford I had a problem with their story when that didn't add up\nTake emotion out of it\nThe reason why I didn't believe Mrs Ford is because she got to hand pick the people that were in the house in the room and people said the president was mocking Mrs forwarded that campaign rally when you know she said you know Brett Kavanaugh you know try to ... murder me and raped me remember that\nOne year to happen I don't know where to happen I don't know how'd you get there I Can't remember how did you leave I don't know you tell anybody know\n\nMillennia Trump said exactly what every and this is where I Believe the midterms are going to backfire on the Democrats\nI Do I really do believe that there are too many mothers out there that have sons\nThat have husbands that have nephews that have dads and they saw what they did to Brett Kavanaugh based on a political assaults and nothing else and the assault is still going\n\nThe assault is still going Democrats are saying elect us to one of the houses put\nUs in charge of houses or the Senate and we will impeach Brett Kavanaugh\n\nNot based on facts based on emotions in a mob mentality based on the fact that got nothing else around on so let's turn every Republicans into a\nRacist or sexist sexual assault individual\nTurn them into a gang rape is that's what you gotta do to turn them into that\nTurn them into that\n\nOne age seven seven three

number one hero\nOr they were the party and the KKK [noise]\nAnd er Jim Crow segregation okay those are things we're all supposed to know\n[noise] but I learned just recently that the Democratic party not one party member voted for the passage of the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments that ended slavery so what does that tell you basically they're not the party of freedom\nAnd that's been the problem for a long long time\nAnd it's time Americans just grab their bootstraps and we do something about it because it's never going to end with these people they're the plantation owners\nAnd if somebody like Kanye leaves the plantation then all hell breaks loose pardon my French\nBut uh you know they're the anti Freedom Party a\nWhile you get your kid you know search suicides in record says who's the faces Democratic Party she said the electoral college is an institution that has its roots in slavery\nSo therefore it should be abolished with the Democratic party has its roots in slavery and it certainly we already of slavery right and so shouldn't we eliminate that institution as well using her logic the\nParty still exist okay after World War two [noise] what do you think [laughter]\nWhy wasn't the Democrat Party abolished you know why because Lincoln was assassinated had Lincoln not been assassinated I'm saying things that I'm sure a million Americans are just you

I'll just genocide less it of course as always\nMr ... where do you see this court has got their President Trump on her opportunity under the sports such conduct Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed a study that second jumped are hard to justify why did\nYou see this court filing turning back she'll be out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future outs are what are your thoughts on that sir\nBut did you have two questions that that was just that was\nYour are your ... going on these justices and are you all over the future that we could turn back the tide I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very much Raj abuse or you're going in other words I Will grants or Jim Cavanaugh tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial fortitude\nYeah I actually think that this is very very hopeful\nLike ed in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kavanaugh there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower court had to defer to the to the interpretations have various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely and so\nThat that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there\nHe's a constitutional list he's a text you list just just like Gorsuch is and the other three people\nIncluding especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question and now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton\nExpected them to take when he wrote that ... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA ... it's a remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face with voters the courts don't want her to be so reluctant about\n[laughter] [laughter] I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public you know what I mean we don't even associate with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that says the areas of that but Alexander Hamilton was white and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he it out but he had been asked why are you giving the court\nThe judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nWhy shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president that's\nLifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president or Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people the courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that those decisions in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd the effort by the president and after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota denied good evening\n[noise] either thanks for taking my call sure [noise] I just mentioned just turn it on here and I didn't I haven't [noise] but uh your guests mentioned ... [noise] you know he said that uh\nWhere Republican or a democracy and I agree with that and I agree with you know kind of\nTimeframe when he says the problem started you know it's also around that time from what I've read were [noise] you'd start ... and you know people start calling us of democracy and not a Republican I soon and I heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean as long as we have a representative democracy that's why although and made me that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course we're at the point where that is technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nAnd we can even talked about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that though Peter\n[noise] no I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatives I'm afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people go running through\nThe legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nConservative should not worry about calling something that democracy\nThe democracy that the founders didn't like was democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of um Khan a conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the building I don't know we'll as a good idea that's right well we'll get we'll come back to that as time allows the right now a call from Sharon in crane Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\nYeah kinda Dan ... maybe I and my space back I'm\nVery movement can have a constitutional convention and one of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have friends that we have a ... term limits for the legislative branch and the reigning power of\nExecutive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd not legit site Cherokee not I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it when that change that balance so that the courts possibly would\nIn any stat that kid that plate a little bit more because a lot of it's like to have to take more responsibility All right\n... ... the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the courts actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for them just to pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nHave to be made for the ...

wise or unwise decision may have been\nI wouldn't be a subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nBut no not unless it was an action that was not surprised by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress has an authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress passes\nSometimes allows administrators even conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nIn that in fact that's what we're talking about and that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it ... it or a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law uh

Gary\n[noise] getting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get off on your ear I agree with almost everything your guest has said ... ... ... a minor point\nI I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of the Democratic republic but that's my my lawyers that they really were giving him some addicts federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time they ... it takes quite on your show but anyway um and then the\nThe the main thing is that I Want to call about is the constitutional convention and that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that\nWant to do this and think I think it would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to go off and right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now be a term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress be at a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally although you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as if this has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used to date Raul amendments start with Congress then we can forget about any of those things ever happening uh\nLet me add one thing there Jim I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but let's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because\nI think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these bureaucracies had\nBut how do you see the way out of you for swayed short of of of some method of of of force\nAh ah how ... how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they have gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean they're not just suddenly say gee Peter you are right so you're gonna have to arm twist these people are going to have to drag them\nAnd I don't know how you do that just by saying please read this book is a great read but I don't think I'd want to do\nLet me say this and I I I agree that it's tough but we have five members of the Supreme Court now

the people like gay west\nAnd other people that's coming out saying hey I can think for myself and I don't need to pull feeding me a narrative you're not going to bully me back in the box I can say what I Need to save for myself what you see them doing that\nThat's what we called the evolution and the people are evolving these people are evolving from what we started back in two thousand to Fifteen because we don't see a lot of people with cameras back into the fifteenth\nSpeaking their mind about anything it was just diamond said God there are so that's why I say wait that was the revolution we had the ... now what you're seeing is the evolution people are evolving into something great and we love it\nI'm Glad you mentioned that because I Want to ask Wesley before we remind

feel that Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson's I don't want\nTo speak for the black community and people have to go through these organizations like the N. double ACP and the black congressional caucus they have to go through those organizations have reached the black people I\nUnderstand why they feel like that because they've been conditioned to think that way they've been conditioned to feel like that's how we're supposed to go right to start the status quo so when diamond then silk come out to black women patriotic conservative waiting to come out and say well\nThis is what we like this is what we don't like and we gave it to you straight from the gay that's right you just turn it people are taking back about it and yet we will cause all kinds of derogatory name [laughter]\nI just heard that the fake news people on a panel of what happened to be people of color sit there and call ... was nasty names but but but but what do you know who you are\nNo one in a year die minutes so we knew who it was back in two thousand and Fifteen so no matter the names that they caught us no one could name a baby when we fight we fight but we fight what facts\nWe continue to let them fight with their

I I think everybody expected markets why Miller to be the main running back the guy that would get the majority of the yards and Trevor Alan would be as backup tremors really shine this as a running back for us this year he's really showed us some things in the running game and it just like you need\nUsually need two quarterbacks to get through the tough season you and I place you also got to
