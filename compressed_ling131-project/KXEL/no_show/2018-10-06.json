I remember it as well er and most other people we went with to do that\nWe went to I see the light show or in the dining ended a planetarium earlier first time I heard a Led Zeppelin songs they played it in a planetarium it did back in the day I don't think they do it in like a laser light show our right there to music\nWhich was again something brand new no one ever did\nAnd they would change the music like it would be different music every night\nYeah there was a Beatles night or whatever it was and so that was great fun but you're talking about ... that movie does represent a lot of the ... that some kids unfortunately even from that that was in the sixties even from a from the sixties to this day experience home life is a little difficult\nParents aren't ah maybe on the same page all the time maybe parents aren't together it leads to a lot of this teenage ... which James Dean Natalie Wood and south many oh in this movie really presented in a way that still I think universal I think in some ways\nAll the knife fights and stuff don't happen anymore too much as other stock went out in the way it was portrayed right but but I think that it it does still represent the struggles that the kids go through\nEven though Jim back as the Senate who's missing but go in there somehow the third from Africa Gilligan's Island but even he represents the father who is in that he is a different generation just not understanding\nWhat this child is going through and doing what he thinks is right the materialism thing journalistic things and I I give you support and even earlier in that scene is his his son his drunk and he's saying it's okay I did that when I was a kid too so he's trying what he can\nAnd there is no book to raising kids and so I don't I don't know that the the that the movie even as the father is still sympathetic in that movie he's right out of touch but he's trying\nThe grandmother or who made that last comment there is not so nice the wife is not so nice and so now you see what the struggle comes as your dad versus mom and my family so\nAh leaves the the kid in between so we've seen that in high school um I don't know if you have any experience has anything to share whatever if not we move on but the idea was a ... you know there's all of us have struggles\nAt that teen those teenage years that uh I don't know it's just hard because I haven't gone through it yet with my kids hard to know how to navigate through in what the right answer\nWhile the other thing is that the kids when they when your kids are in high school they don't necessarily talk to you about what they're going right on through and I didn't really talk about with my parents too much right Asian like that that [noise] but didn't express them you know one tenth of what I was really\nTo if it ever got to the point was really bad something ... something really bad happens or you did something really you know then that was the symptom the last straw if you will that then you would release all of well I've been going\nYou see something really bad happens or you did something really you know then that was the symptom the last straw if you will that then you would release all of well I've been going through this the last month or whatever it is but even just to be in touch with your feelings what you're feeling that you're allowed to talk about it and maybe talking about it helps that was not in my world at\nAll how my neither no so so it gets it wasn't an issue and it was in because my parents wouldn't listen because it's the way I was I just didn't want to talk about it right you know I was a teenager rice was known what and what's talking going to do like that that age yeah right oh so you're talking about I Can't solve the problem but my parents are going to do right yeah exactly you\nKnow just to release that you know the steam if you will build up and you had to leave the least that vow even sure and sometimes that does help so\nYou know but also parents are paying the mortgage parents are looking to to do shopping experience of all of these you have a food all these ... these obligations that you have to run and keep the house going on fortunately sometimes\nYou know the kids in the back of the cardio asking them how school or what have you or you want to hear the answer but you've got you know three minutes before you stop at the gas station\nOr whatever so sometimes they don't feel that they want to talk to you while the sitting in the back of the car\nRight yeah it's got to be a good time for them to talk to you not just when it's convenient for you right exactly which is what I wanted to pick 'em up in between errands there after when they kinda know they're smart they are now like okay this is the window I'm getting in and screw him tell it right\nAnd they don't they don't say a lot of stuff but uh my wife smart was she'll take some time when she's you know bathing with them and all and things slow down\nAnd she she does it a lot better than I Do is she'll just talk to them and now they're into the mode of being at least my nine year old little girl was talking to my wife a lot more about things and it's great and what's going on so yeah I Hope that uh at some point in time I can slow down and and do that too is Leo I mean I think ... I don't know if it works and not\nThat was the son versus mom with a daughter I don't know whatever but I I Try what I can all the time but uh anyway so that's expressed very well\nAre you feeling better talking it out you know I feel wars I feel like honestly I feel like Mr McGregor at this point a to where the apron memory of the apron hundred back as saying\nIf you're if what if what if you haven't seen that movie you got to see that movie\nRight I mean it's it's a it's real but back to what it is trying to think outside the box have some fun do some things uh you know that you haven't done before keep an open mind don't make rules about what friends you have in and who you're going to hang out with\nCall them all up and whether she shows up shows up to to see the movie in the theater or you know the library or whatever it might be see an old movie just as the movie's black and white by the way it doesn't mean as bad movie\nI Can't watch that movie that is true that said uh anyway now\nAndy Griffith I played this previously but I Love this because this turned the tide a little bit I Want to talk about school and how sometimes school and the subject in school can actually be fun if that makes any sense\nWhat I'm\nSaying is bred codes and you know history yeah [laughter] that's crazy as good and\nThey had they had a gun and fired a shot of us are clear around the world Thursday or [noise] what kind of the last\nGuy the guy the guy that got looking fires are going to be heard around the world that was [laughter]\nWell uh there was this fell off you sure you want to hear their stories history\n[laughter] hey tell a story [laughter]\nSo we talked about his previously but you know the teacher can make a a you know a history and one of the subject is come alive for people like that or for this you know their students it's just a it's such an advantage such a great way to learn and you have any teachers like that ever are\nNot sure I had him in college up to ... even in college I had teachers like that they would you know do something different and actually made make the subject matter more interesting ... however they want her to do whether it was like acting out old\nYou know characters in history or giving scenarios from their own life about what happened just something that humanized it for you or made a big difference I remember that to this day\nYeah and I and and I do too and and uh you don't think you you would remember or that and we'll talk about this in the next section about the teachers so to speak but\nAlso the subjects them\nI Do too and and uh you don't think you would remember or that and we'll talk about this in the next section about the teachers so to speak but\nAlso the subjects themselves I Would say this sometimes in school or you don't know you know especially a high school does this pressure going to go to college what are you going to major in what's going to do what are you going to do what do you do the rest of your life you know you're sixteen Seventeen how do we know that\nBut maybe you know maybe\nThat those particular subject to to to you talk\nIs not your bag so maybe you could eliminate at least a couple of things that you know from the from the table and see what's left standing\nAs opposed to picking one out of all of a list is that makes me sent home makes total sense so at least you

the American family farmer I dug staffing here\nAgain with another overview of important things going on in the agricultural world of the family farmer this program is not about anything other than getting fair prices a fair shake for family farms especially the whole business with Gerry it's um [noise]\nAh it's the whole world has gotten nuts [laughter] as far as what I can see that people just to not get while the people get it that somehow or other ... and this is the first time visitor happen\nThere's a disconnect between government and the people\nSo we're going to talk about how that's been remedied in part by the folks that produce farm eight and a few moments we're going to meet one of the people are very closely connected and directing farm made been with it for quite a long time\nA so we'll get to the bottom line of what was created at farm made this year\nThis program is on the air because I Am a farmer\nAnd I believe that the stories of family farmers need to be told on the air at is not a program is sponsored by the big agribusiness is five seconds listening to this program and they wouldn't come near it but all the rest of this stuff that's on the air whether it's radio or television or mostly in print\nI'd been shunned by most of the big publications because they get all their money from the big agri businesses and are these companies are not connected there my future and that are connected to your future\nSpeaking of the future I think normally I started the hour with uh some news updates if you will you'll recall for the past ten years there's been a lot of their base a lot of regulatory wrangling and or the government now trying to implement\nEven though there are a number of delays and their ... their so called\nFood safety modernization act\nOr the time is coming for this thing to actually be put into place\nHad ... organizations working for you for the small family farmer\nThat it yes it is so hard to say or\nInvested are involved I think she was any way I don't know much about her husband know them and they all made a lot of money when they told the supermarket chain off a but they have been devoted to this whole idea\nOf community gardening I think they know what I mean they understand it and I do but I never understood how Willie founder added Willie Nelson finder\nOr not well they were running in the same circles are Carolyn wise and dog get a lot of organized labor ...\nOr ... all over the years I've had that Larry ... arms in Iraq how they can opt out of the um um she's always had an interest in chewed on that really it's about the people for her and making a collection so she traveled the country and that fire married stared out sure had some solution to farm crisis so far make some money behind them are all\nThey are still up and running to this day and helping farmers on the land\nWhere I think I Would like to talk about where the money goes a lot of people ask that question as you know this program is devoted to helping the family\nFarmer it's the only one of its kind all the other radio programs television shows are all sponsored by the big agribusiness is a this program is in a matter of fact we don't even have any sponsors [laughter]\nBecause I'm so independent and so devoted to the same sort of thing that really is and obviously Carolyn ... is so I Want to pursue that with you and how to spread out all the information Jennifer fate you with us here on the American family farmer show\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nReliance with today's baseball trivia questions from your friends with

master urban gardener as so you have applied Jamaica Plain new college J. P. around here has been quite well gentrified I think over the past ten twelve Fifteen Years has now Jennifer\nRetained a lot of it's character thinking\nWe're hearing a plane that's sweet area for it and you're not fail battle for sure yeah ...\nIt is a it's a it's an interesting kind of a quirky neighborhood Dorchester some of these areas around Boston\nA mad at Penn but they are changing but there's a lot of people just as an aside or one of the things we've talked about here on a number of occasions and the American family farmer program is how\nUrban areas can find or may create if you will places for their own food we grow we all know the stories about growing gardens on top of buildings in New York City but there are companies that are making projects\nOh did we grow we all know the stories about growing your gardens on top of buildings in New York City but there are companies that are making projects are finding places in the cities where you're going to have fresh fruit grown right is that is that something that\nYou look at it from ... perspective or just somebody like you who knows what's going on is aware of these these concepts in these things\nNo I mean it definitely involved in that as well um\nYou know it gets farming is not just a whirl occupation I mean can\nYou know more and more I become and or mental on as well and as we has moved me try made\nLent around the country we have often ended up in cities because that's where a lot of people are and that's where the concert venues are and uh we were in New York City and two thousand seven and people speculate why would it be a New York city and he said well\nWhy are people in the city than any other city and uh you know at that point we ... got to\nKeep our connection to our food and we can do that by growing on our\nApartment balconies urban gardens and down the right there is a lot of it has potential as well and Boston has been\nA leader and um you know changing a zoning so that urban agriculture is possible and that businesses can help 'em get folk started and and make it has that it's going to get food in cities\nDo you find that your approach to this the I'm going to ask you at some point in time as we have our conversation how the money how do you decide where the money goes but do you find through the work you're doing for example issues cause it was in Hartford\nUh them about well there's the arena between Hartford in Springfield and I watched an access TV to see who is there I I Want to see willy overseas family on a C Neil Young I as I said I've been to a couple of them are Mellencamp Dave Matthews seems to have a more and more every year more of a prominent position 'cause\nHe's the youngest of the group and probably has the most energy and any people identify with him and he identifies with the farmers\nUm the the the essence of what we're trying to do is call attention to the needs that farmers have\nA but also we're farming is taking place\nAnd I think you've just said something that was very interesting as farming changes or it happens to be an economic reality here because it's hard it's expensive to transport\nGood fresh food around so have you grow it were the people are and and so I Wonder how much you get in terms of business support\nBusiness local businesses say okay you're a local farmer here's a hundred bucks or a thousand bucks or a hundred thousand bucks to help you do what you're doing is that happened\n[noise] um there are organizations that do you like roller it's like that and\nFinally we are at a nonprofit organization and our goal is to effect change in a farming system and so we're not giving money directly to farmers to start businesses were actually not allowed to do that\nAnd we are supporting organization across the country that provides that technical assistance and ... and like all loans to fires on the poll get them started share on in there so\nThat's another one check you and you may have heard me talking about how the new that new farm safety act is being enacted and\nI mean we were talking about either trying to get there as we continue on this week's American family farmer\nGoing back to school can be annoying\nSummer's over and I have to start doing commerce and even more annoying time I'm On a link console games a lot of candy and John ... not ... gallon tank

difference my energy is back\n[noise] well typically the concert enabled ... about ... million and a half\nAnd one way that that money gets spent is throughout and grant program and show I'm just\nComing back from the concert we move in ... when we had hundreds of applications started organizations across the country are doing work with ... Amin says not at the top of the show fitting that has been um something that we have\nUm funded projects around for years and years and so we have groups on the grounds on in communities working with primaries are saying okay this is how it coming down\nBusy words you have to let us know where they don't have them and don't let somebody else tells you something else right\nAnd have been fighting for years to make sure that those regulations are not one size maybe as as you say family farmers have it how different operations that there are different ... that they should have to meet that are not as stringent as those ten thousand cow Gary's shit so what\nWe find organizations across the country who are providing hotlines to farmers in the habit of suicide epidemic right now with the marketing and agriculture ... got at putting money and resources behind that were also fighting for that and the farm bill there is a bill that is included in the Senate and house surgeon that's my bell\nSupporting farmers and ranchers jak assistance network which would put ten million dollars per year from the U.S government and queue hotlines and services that can help primary\nWow horrible ... one of 'em ridiculous statement actually that is\nWhat a comment on the state of farming we have no food we have no life we have no health and yet we're fighting it at every turn because of the ... thinking of the not so much in the ... who let these bureaucrats\nPut these everywhere to this the regulations don't come from politicians they come from Europe crash and the regulations often from people who go\nTo the industrial eggs schools where the chairs are supplied by Monsanto and that ilk or what do you think we're going to teach them and it's like me selling raw milk I used to sell us a hundred gallons or on the other day on my farm in Framingham\nCut the twelve bucks a gallon that wasn't enough to sustain the farm I even though it could have kept going there were other things that people come because they don't want you to sell raw milk because they don't think it's healthy when the local board officials called the white death\nI mean the stupidity of people who don't realize this is the natural\nFood this is the way we're supposed to bring it not processed and microwaved and whatever the hell else they do to down to like it just it than than fighting that\nAll the time because you have these people who supposedly have degrees in there the knowledge they're the experts pool then at the experts at all on the expert because they've been around cause all my life and on a milk the cow I Know how to make sure the milk is pure and I don't need somebody who's looking you pay forty six of some book that says this is what you're supposed to do\nAnd yet that's what we are confronted with all the time frankly\nRight and what we need and status for people to be helping encourage farmers to pray though is in kind of strange out there that's why they're firing so that we don't have to carry that\nYou know rely on a processor and when they get canceled their processor that would pick up their milk and they have to close their doors so we have to we have to have\nPeople in the department of agriculture and elsewhere cost the government and you believe in family farm raised that are making it easier for them to succeed rather than putting up

all we can go Thursday at Indiana State hit shutout back to back shut out to eat for this you and I put both teams nine quarters in a role in they have not\nAllow their opponent just score Panthers put it on Indiana State thirty three to nothing coming in with some confidence some momentum after that when\nNo question about it and it was a rock star but the parents are in tough schedule you know I'm going to Montana we knew that would be tough ... in Iowa in Iowa City that's always going\nTo be some place to get a victory but I've seen improvement and I think they've got more faith in in more confidence in what they're doing and they are pulling together as a as a team and we're not ... man that that really helps the you know they're getting the ball back to the ...\nThings are looking pretty good I'm now these are going to step it up level today if they're going to be I'd love to see another shutdown whether we will not I I doubt that but I Would love to see that as the parents or do you guys can do that and that will be quite a bit you know when you look\nAt this magic water some of the things that that from the un I panther side of it that concern you what would taking on North Dakota state as you've seen how the the bystander played in recent years against you and I in the valley in apps yes football what are the concerns\nWell this is what they do I mean they come out and and then they're going to run the football game or they're going to establish that Iran there's no doubt about it all fits really if you can't stop the run that you know you're not going to see much else but what it does is it gets that play actually passing game which they're so dangerous that\nFinished his tickets factor quarterback so much experience in such a good athlete running that ... limited just he's a master of it and that that's really a challenge that that the parents will have to somehow overcome and you know try and get some pressure on him\nGet rid of the ball you know I think a year ago you remember the Panthers had to first half interceptions but only ended up you know there had seven or nothing just before ap diamond then and then through ... and tied it up there is not going to stay there going into\nThen the second half the kind of got role and that's what they do to ... they wear you down there so big and physical up\nDiamond then and then through thick and thin and tied it up there is no way to go to stay there going into\nThen the second half they kinda got role and that's what they do to change they wear you down there so big and physical up front but that often said line and and you're going to seek titans and both ... not a whole lot of spreads stuff you know but they they don't want I Want to throw that got some very talented receivers that we'll talk about too but it's just a very well balanced officers\nRecorded message of course another one of those parents are graduates as those Chris crime in the head coaches the panther\nGraduate here too it's you know so it's an important they played here if this gay means extra to them I think you're I really do love you just can't help\nMatt answer because corner was was our coach Farley staff this means a lot to him to come and he's a Waterloo kitten\nYou know coming in from west Waterloo so those guys are there are Jason raised the receiver coach now he was on mark Farley staffers up they're far going out and doing a great job with the wide receiver so there's a lot of close connections here you know between the ... and the guys that have been here play here worked with coach barley that type of thing [noise]\nAnd ... and defensive here they've always been so solid evidence is they run to the football they rally to get to turn over ... this is really hard to find a weakness anywhere you know as I as I look at um try to Scott I'm In and watch some of their ... how about some of the south Dakota state gave some of the Delaware game\nYou know the Big Bend a little bit defensive they gave up some big plays against South Dakota state who not much to Delaware that was it was kind of a surprise and [noise] and that that that's the thing the Panthers somehow we're going to have to find some chump plays today some big yard is place to keep drives alive and that type\nIn North Dakota state just has a formula for a plan and they just don't bury\nRight on it but it it it just seemed looks very similar to the things we've seen with six in the last seven national title done that I mean did you just run the ball you're you're protected football you through the little play I should stuff just you'll see some screens you'll see some spread stuff you know they'll throw that got\nSome white outs that are very capable good athletes they got [noise] I mean eight for running backs Gary that really can rotate in and we'll probably see mainly the two you know that\nHave been carrying the ball for mostly at another Waterloo kitten Lance done over here that I'm sure he'll be two step to go is final a senior year up there and he's had a great career form so it is this a lot of stuff going on between the programs\nBut you're right there formula for success has written I coach bowl got started up there no question about it\nOf course climate went up there as a as a defensive coach first is the deepest aback became a coordinator he learned from him and then he's transport him in his own program now at a wedding or to national titles up their self his oppressive Gary what they do they do it well\nYou have to be better you have to out North Dakota state you have to do you have to run the football you got to put physical defense if you're going to feed them and not many things have been able to do that recently hamsters you feel like\nThey are going to have to be somewhat balanced often simply you gonna have to find a running game [noise] hard to do it but you got to the running game was really good at Indiana State [noise] gonna have to get the ball moving on the ground and then the passing games should be there to\nTry that and that's important that'd be that'd be a very important if they can protect the lie down you know that's that's the last time he'll find it open receiver there's there'll be some gaps in Marysville that a lot to say he has such a\nFierce pass rush that that that that's easier said than done so\nThat's one of those things like that will be interesting to watch you still have to try and run the football you can't just abandoned the Romney yeah you got to search it out and it and find creative ways to do it I think we'll see some wild cat stuff you know we know they know where you are done is not a running quarterback he's got a strong arm he's a typical post style quarterback even dropped back\nIn and fire that thing to get it all there are three and five step drop zero in on time he'll be fine with that if they can somehow get a little\nThat wild cat and the running game you know motion in the ... northern hours to get tied ends in their lives missing them and brought him won't\nGet them involved you know hit him in the short little passing his get them of all those two are good blockers they become like a full back really in there so they can\nGet some things are going to get to the edge gets the jump plays in the run and gave that a bold well form as the game lawyers are\nGetting off do a good start doesn't mean you're going to win the game but got to believe that he not to get behind a couple of scores early against the spice and team that they've been one of the best teams in all of that cs football in in in time management time time control of the football\nNow that said that they hang on to an end especially like Gary you know that's the thing it just wears on your wears on you or you know they might come out it might have a couple of three and all that type of thing but the pound and they're pounded the founded and may stay with that they don't they don't abandon it they don't go to a spread attack there just keep pounding that thing and\nA lot of times [noise] close game in the fourth quarter this like you did against South Dakota state they were down through scores that came back and won it in the at the end but the you know and that's been there for them and they've done that against a lot of good teams this'll be a challenge from Northern Ireland I think you know I think I Know the coaches already that extra two days of ... really does does help you but no question about it\nHoney can you grab the sacred debate for three

season that that they are the last time that's happened I was Nineteen Ninety seven previously fifty seven\nWas the only other time that that has happened so it's it's a little different\nI think for this team this year it has been a\nRight way to start and developing some of the younger Moyers\nAlso obviously mixed in with the twenty five returning seniors off of last year seem it's better quality ... starting coming off of a big win last weekend versus South Dakota state Twenty one Seventy\nAnd I know it's hard to compare teams ... if you've\nSeen this team win national championships the CFPB level this dean comparable to what you saw last year run the run the table and and when the title but there are a lot of comparisons you know you have a lot of those are rich orders that were

[noise] so that's what that's what my fans do they compare the thirteenth season I think for this year as a group\nYou talked to some of the coaches on this tab\nNorth Dakota state and they tell you that this group is still not yet a finished product a lot of work to be done so I think jumping at least in comparison to come back to the last season no\nDoubt who your leader is on our fence your senior quarterback\nWhat have you seen out of the ... how good is that unit\nWell it's it's going to be similar to watch their fans have seen from NDSU during this Missouri Valley football conference

North Dakota state you've had a couple of extra days to prepare for this one was playing a Thursday night game [noise] much of an advantage from from that standpoint going into this one\nI felt it it's it's advantageous for the players\nTheir injury healed so did he get a couple of guys back we got air Graham got back we got Christian Jake and back\nAppears will get Jared break been back in may appear that we get comments back so those are the guys that were the back we may or may not get Ellis back\nHope is we do but he's right there at that stage but have we had to play two days earlier there was no way so yes for that reason good as far as trying to get a plan and then thinking they're going to have some magic come of this note which we we roll back into town midnight we we landed back\nUh if you got to get to go to class the next day we just watched the film he must take so many days off Saturday was our day off for last week's Sunday was our day off for this week so those two days off and we're back to work on Monday just like they were so I don't know that there was advantageous in the plan was advantageous for the kids are\nA little bit of a fine line too when you have a little extra time that you make sure you don't you don't have over\nMyself sometimes you always try to figure out how to do it right and you try to make it perfect 'cause it's all about practice how many reps do I get\nAnd there was an extra day of practice being that we could practice on Monday normally that's just a film bay ice day you know not much moves around that that was actually a practice day so now we practice Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and I do all this makes parents should practice for days in a row\nTrying to get the energy that you need to be out on Saturday So there's a fine line and you never know if you cross that line and tell you laugh on Saturday to see where the energy that\nPrior to kick off today with everything's set to go\nA ... and we won't know how well it is going to work until you actually play the game but how how do you and the staff deal\nAbout the game plan about\n[noise] about what you've done to prepare for this one today\nI couldn't talk about it 'til now so now you get to that get the real\nWe're so close we're not there and we're so close I watch the film I watch this practice I see [noise]\nBelieve could be\nFlashes of any state gets a little bit more consistent hit has a show the Saturday because the big test the Saturday because there's the ... the census coming after we taught\nBecause of our quarterback play probably doesn't match up well with how they play a\nMore pocket passer and\nA more pocket could change the chef so\nThis is one of those games that were going to find a way to create an advantage for for ...\nThe like and make every throwing the board is just that they will\nWill come after him on the edges and they'll try to keep them to come in the pocket and she could get away [noise] I'd be sitting there saying that that would be a great day but\nWe're gonna have to find ways to do with it whether it's his skill set\nBecause where they really struggle is quarterbacks a scramble to get in trouble\nAll the games will beat them in all the games that were\nTo go back to arms and and\nAll different quarterbacks around real rainy all the guys that Iran and those are the guys that took 'em to task and because of the get away you have to slow down your pressure when a guy can get away and\nKind of what we're on our challenge is to get the land a good position so he can win with his skill sets paramount\n... to ... be hard to put up maybe the rushing numbers you did against Indiana State against spice and ... got to believe hugely important to get something on the ground begin today with Trevor Alan and mark is why Miller I think\nThe key is getting [noise]\nHow did you are so you're not for second intent you got to get our second attempt to it's all about for ten you're stuck in the pan here comes here comes the house and and now you're sitting there ten and that's how they win if you go back and study how they when they are always in close games\nThey get the blowouts once\nTurnover started him intercepts turnover ... that's when it becomes a route they routed Delaware I think it was thirty eight to ...\nBecause they had three touchdowns on defense alone\nJust because of the interception em em because they they\nFrustrate the quarterback and that is still\nThem so this is a fine line that's what I said for Bulger's akita's football game soldier density your\nDefense has shut down the opponent the ninth street corners this look good on the bench she'll face today led by a senior quarterback in eastern stick talk about the challenges where your deep Ben's today to just slow down this place in ...\nThe challenge for to stop these instead is when his feet here's two hundred and fifty some odd yard so mainly all time leading Russia and Missouri Valley ...\nPer hour any way for us and he ran for a while you are so [noise] um [noise] the Andre Smith played the option for Missouri state blast I looked around for a lot of yard that tells the fans and tells the coaches that they don't\nAnd yet he's almost leading Russia scramble\nGoing to go back and when they beat Iowa\nOut of empty they made the biggest way to get down to get feel position\nThat was probably the biggest things so [noise] the dangers of his arms have tremendous arm is more dangerous loosely hand\nOf pretty good running backs to hand the two two and Bruce Anderson\nIn line and tell you what last done for a while\nHe's comes from a great family\nTo highschool [noise] so\nYou know the other guy don't have any affiliation to so\nWorking I school and so\nThe other guy don't have any affiliation to so\nWith these things that can that scramble ability and just run the ability to do something special defensively you put a spy that man he's lived in a number as\nI can you can you dedicate a [noise] a defensive player to that today well I've seen guys are dedicated player to spy but then the spy can\nCatch it so you might as well have dedicate one too and so if you're if you're going to dedicate wanting better be good enough for getting [noise] and so\nWe're not delegated all they are afraid\nIt in a number of these games over the years as you
