matter please explain to me since you think this is a ...\nIt's a bow tie wearing bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me since you think this is a net good for society and you should ask this of all you're liberal friends how much money argued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government\nGo how much\nThe answer I can almost assure you with me or certain pie is Ciro matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservatives this is not a problem we are not\nWe know the government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need\nTo liberals make the exact opposite argument now the government is such a force for good to have rich people should get more money than what why please explain to me how we have been paying these anti poverty\nProgram since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and a percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member of the work has gone up knocked down\nWe have not moved the poverty rate in any significant way at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention Phil Gramm had a great piece in the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilized\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars and equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and a number of people working that are eligible family members the number of percentage of people working has gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else would've worked don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not to laugh\n\nWhile you simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hire to count points to avoid paying extra taxes to the government\nWhy did you do that why\nIf the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them don't be a phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger that you're such a fake serious that you're a fraud when you look in the mirror orange\nShe like wow I'm a real phony I Love the government do everything in my power to pay accounts to avoid giving the government money\nDoesn't that make you more fake how do you live like that serious I don't have that issue I look in the\nMirror go yeah the government really sucks patch I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts tend to be constitutional role of government where there's mass consensus based than they waste money like known them our government it's thanks it's a disaster I have no issue with that\nI look in the mirror no and yet I Do everything legally I can to pay as few tax\nDollars as possible but not you frauds\nYou don't pay extra you want me to pay more you do anything because you\nMight say well than on a couple of people to voluntarily Patrick I read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweed me I'm happy to hear it\nBut I read a report a few years ago that the record amount of money the government and brought in up until that time involuntary tax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government you're never going to believe this number\nTwelve million dollars million not billion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars\nWe have three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAre you telling me if I say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberal say there are thirty million liberals there's probably more than that probably closer to forty or fifty who would classify themselves as liberals say there's twenty five million if each of those liberals just donated a dollar to the government\nThe government they worship that they send you fly in front of that they did they almost consider an act of religion and faith if you just donated a dollar they would double the amount that voluntarily paid to the government a paltry twelve million dollars that's it\nSo lives step up stop being such frauds stop being such

and I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\n[noise] ladies and gentlemen the chances of losing your job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nAre significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of is that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented\nTo the court was not that folks was not that it was only the style alleged basically in the ... and\nHere say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right now is married to this latest narrative this is all they have\nIf the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI information the guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole ... that's why this is so critical now what's the big question\nHere the big question is what is the exculpatory evidence and I want to put to potential theories out there for you\nWhat is the exculpatory evidence the evidence indicating Papadopoulos may not be guilty that these members of Congress are saying exist that's out there in the ...\nEvidence the evidence indicating Papadopoulos may not be guilty that these members of Congress\nAre saying exist that's out there in the in the ether\nI make a suggestion the right if this meeting with down or in the Australian bar Alexander down her and the so called a you know exchange of Russians may have dirt on Hillary in town over so suspicious anybody record that meaning\nYou find that even remotely interesting that Papadopoulos himself who now that he is a he has taken a plea on this line to a federal agent charging you fight even remotely interesting that that Papadopoulos himself he's bringing up the fact that he feels he was recorded\nBy does that matter [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen what if the recordings of this meeting with down or saying\nNothing of the sword about Russian collusion or anything else oh that'd\nBe a little bit of a problem now wouldn't it have a problem that\nWe have a little bit of an issue you think maybe a ... a judge would want to know that there there may have been a recording\nOf this ... not sure there is I'm just saying that's out there it's out there that there may be something but if it's a recording of this conversation that's not exactly the way the FBI painted it oh [noise] yeah that one's things a little bit oh uh [noise]\n\nWe make another suggestion to you [noise] the guy who supposedly gave Papadopoulos this information about the Russian there at the sky miss that I call him the pusher he's pushes the information into the sphere according to multiple reports on this\nThey interviewed miss that they interviewed him the FBI in February before\nBut for the last five years of renewal before the last Pfizer renewal in front of a judge where they ... to get all Papadopoulos pay we got to get these guys\n\nWhat if ms Seward who allegedly push this information about Russian dirt into the Trump sphere that was pulled out later what if he wasn't working for the Russians at all\n[noise] what if he was working for Friendly's folks to\nThe book lays it out I think it pretty conclusive case that somebody has a lot of explaining to do about exactly who Joe submissive was\nIf this potentially exculpatory evidence that George Papadopoulos was set up the whole time he was the fall guy that he was going to be the one maybe they targeted a low level guy because he thought it would be easy oaks is is this scandal of the century and raccoons interview with me to Maria bought aroma this ... is very\nTelling it's telling for very precise reasons he's indicating that the entire case the FBI's making right now was it George Papadopoulos started this thing while there's potentially information out there saying George Papadopoulos may be innocent of the whole thing altogether\n\nOn believable unbelievable\nAll right I mean take some calls me want to get to the calls of you want to give us call she made seven seven three one create one what let's take a call from Los Angeles

you know he only played out to line you know he did more than live we know that he will eat that a felony if the in front of a grand jury ...\nThat are here here's here's what I find interesting about walls wolf is a lawyer if you read back on some of the case documents waltz lawyer at one point had um put out there that in walls defense because remember Wolff wasn't charged with leaking wolf\nWith sharks and food for folks to those those you have to understand what a shame about James multiplicity Senate staffer on the intel committee that was handling the Spygate investigation he was arrested by federal agents for\nBob lying about basically lying about leaking he wasn't arrested for leaking itself that's fascinating because in his defense his attorney was basically threatening to call who in his defense\nSenators on the Senate intel committee wire that interesting and fascinating about the wolf case because if wolf is charged with lying about leak it\nAnd his lawyer saying no no he's not lying we're going to call the senators in his defense what does that tell you folks\nThat maybe the senators on the intel committee may have had some role in this elective weakening of information from the committee to the media to make Trump look bad that's why I find most cases fascinating wolf's case on one more thing about uh two\nPaul Wolff in the tax too is uh his girlfriend there who was

myth that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians even though they've had ... application and they know it's crap does that make settle\nSo my question them take a little further um you know we haven't been term coming up Trump held back releasing the redacted material the papers the Congress the different Congress wanted released if it ... what do you think and I know this is a kind of a it's not a fair question to you the endgame on this\nAnd I'll laugh though I think they're perfectly legit perfectly sequestering\nMueller's winding down that's what they tell us anyway and compounds all the all these bullets in his holster what's the endgame is there a grand jury are they're going to\nAnd come as all the all these bullets in his holster what's the endgame is there a grand jury are they're going to\nGive you a difficult but true answer here is All right now about leverage Paul do view of the Mueller probe is a criminal investigation it's not it is yeah it has criminal authority I get that I'm not trying to be selling\nThe Mueller probe is a political investigation designed to damage Donald Trump\nDonald Trump's approval numbers are going up mothers approval numbers

forty or toll free eight hundred five eight four Seventy twenty\nFour let's bring in David Harris director of athletics at the University of northern Iowa making his a weekly appearance on press about what this to talk you and I panther athletics and David let's get right after it his homecoming weekend\nOn the un I campus always a big deal one's a big deal when it's homecoming weekend at you and I\n[noise] it is and this year is no exception from the mathematics perspective we're excited because we have the tone a ton of homey thatch\nOn this week if you look at our soccer program volleyball program in football program all having games or this week and so volleyball and soccer are actually have two games this week so there are plenty of opportunities\nFor panther fans to get out and support their team so as the loans that are coming back looking for opportunities to be able to do things and\nGet out and support student athletes and it seems as though no matter which are interested in there's something for you to do if you're coming back to campus but certainly from an athletic standpoint you have several different options to be able to get out in support our team so we're hoping to have great crowd that each of these jobs\nYeah and you're talking about supporting teams\nThat are doing really really well you and I volleyball nine and I'll start in Missouri Valley conference play at the halfway point of the season sitting on top the un I paint their football team is just a game out of first place in the valley football standings\nBruce Ericson has the the soccer team playing while at the the teams are\nNow competing but they're competing at a high level in a in a winning level David\nDefinitely and that's one of the things that we feel makes you in a special and I know that said that a lot since then here over the past two and a half years but\nWhen I looked at coming to you and I it was one of the things that stuck out to me right away\nWe have sports teams that do well across the board and so\nIf you're supporting you and I let extra support in the stock program that's all it all program the football program that basketball program [noise] softball track on down the road and that support means something it has a made up programs more successful\nIf helps our student athletes in our coaches and it's fun it's fun to be able to be in a situation where you know that no matter what the sport\nOf wherever you're at home or way\nUh you'd have enough to me to be successful and to win and to cheer are student athletes on to victory so we're excited that that tradition is continuing this year\nAre student athletes of doing a great job ah especially excited about our top to news that we have in front of us as you mentioned we have the number two teams coming in from a football standpoint with South Dakota state for homecoming weekend\nSo fast shifts a great chance to be able to set us up to be able to continue to play meaningful games for the rest of the year\n... especially when I mentioned that volleyball program just to be in the spot where we are half way through the conference scheduled to be undefeated but to be in a position where I think we've only played one game that's going to the fifth set us so we have really done well ... been down to that a lot of those games\nI Believe I read somewhere with this the first time that we have to feed it this deepest at a conference season uh since maybe twenty love and when we went Eighteen to know uh and so you don't want to say that it's ultimately what's going to have to be shipped but\nThings are certainly looking good aware and first place and all the credit for that goes to those student athletes in those coaches who come to work every day who work their tails off to be able to go out and perform in a high level and our student athletes really appreciate the support that they get from a fan so\nGetting out and watching that team will be well worth your time it's not often that you have the chance to be able to get out and see a team that's in first place as undefeated and conference play\nAnd is getting ready to have the home stand up for games or in a row so there'll be plenty of opportunities for panther volleyball fans are to be able to come out and watch an exceptional team or continue to play to work their way\nToward what we hope will be a special season and ultimately will earn a postseason bowl or a first postseason I'm a bid to be playing the is it fair to them it\nWithout a doubt just a ton of winning going on right now for all the false sports teams that you an idea of it you know there was a field storming in twenty four teenage un I your former school the Iowa State cycle and she's got fined twenty five thousand dollars per feels coming Saturday\nI Want to know does the valley have any rules about ... if the Panthers when Saturday do I need to stand in front of the students actually tried to hold for thousands of students that [laughter]\nNo normally I Would [laughter] I'm Sorry I didn't know what if if if you if you do try to stand there and hold them back but you might be the only one who stand in ... good luck with that or to be honest with you as a I have not seen with the policy is with in the valley of all\nThose lines it's something that I should actually go and look up but I think Jamie and other people who've been in this position a I'm a a Baton Rouge native and I think I saw that LSU ... find maybe a hundred thousand dollars for fuel storming and their situation\nA it's a double edged sword you you obviously don't want to pay the money but you certainly want to be in the situation\nTo have that level when that level of success so are those eighties uh probably don't complain too much about being in that situation because it means that they're doing something special or within their programs\nAh those eighties uh probably don't complain too much about being in

I just that type of sportsmanship that type of cheering is just\nI don't like it I I just in fact there I've been to a few basketball games\nThat I didn't have to broadcast at the division one level where I was able just to sit and watch it when I'm doing the game I got headphones on your broadcast in my partner's talking to you know I don't hear what the crowd is saying\nBut I I have sat in some games were I'm waiting for our gain distorted that can have the headphones off and just watch the game and and I tell you what there are some things that fans yell\nThat I just want to turn around and say what what are you talking about why that is the why are you saying that that is that it's just you know it it\nIt's unnecessary and and if that was taken place that's something that that the home team management's you got to clean that up that day is my\nQuestion never number one every division one university seems to do that sometimes especially the large shows but how do you tell ten thousand Iowa State of Iowa students to quit in ...\nI think you figure out a way to to clean it up I don't yeah I think I think I just is that is that the image you want your university ... to portray with from your ... okay you you've been in the students' section at you and I football\nFor a couple of home games ... or ... or the un I students chanting that at North Dakota state has the warming up now\nSee I mean so it doesn't happen everywhere and it doesn't have to happen in and I I I'll agree it's not going to be an easy task but you start hauling some guys out some gals out and say hey out you're out there\nJust START I know if there's ten thousand chant their four thousand students you're not going to remove all four thousand but you start removing about fifty of them the other ones will get the message I don't want to leave I Wanna watch the game will they will not stop that stupid chant there is no place for it\nTough yeah and and and in a in a Kevin appreciate the call us and and and you're probably right Chris if you go to a Wisconsin game maybe some of their students are chanting something like that to\nTo Iowa or other teams if you go to when I Will game maybe some of that's taking place at a hawk ... it's not I I don't I'm we're not picking on I was the there is not exclusive to Iowa State I got to believe any way outta but to me that's something that you\nYou've got to work to clean that up I I just can't believe that any athletic department and we talked to a lot of eighties David Harris and\nHearts fill it up right well David at you and I I gotta believe every one of those if we talked to a Gary bar to at Iowa or are we talked to Jamie powder die with state they would tell you that is not\nWhat we want our student athletes are our students are fans to be doing what I really think that they would want to stop that clean it up in in\nWell we want our student athletes are our students are fans to be doing what I really think that they would want to stop that clean it up in in\n... where were you close enough to the Iowa State students section on Saturday or when when they played West Virginia no no I was close to hear anything I'm just I'm just wondering if it may be any of that was taking place\nOn a on Saturday ah it it's just interesting that the reports are that the west Virginia players were coming out chanting that at Iowa State bans as they came out on the the I just\nMay wow we got a problem Houston we have a problem we're back after this [noise]\nHey there's a dinner bell is just about time for dinner let one of these fine eating establishment cook dinner for you tonight peppers grueling sports pub serves brush quality food made from scratch using only the finest ingredients all of the price you can afford it's been that way for Twenty years good friends and good food are always on the menu at peppers six twenty east Eighteenth street Interpol [noise]\nMake montage your destination tonight from prime pet certainly to fireworks past that they have the perfect dish for you pair it with a new favorite from their award winning wine cellar montage was open Monday through Saturday nights visit montage dashed CNN dot com [noise]\nJay's home style cooking is one of my favorites eating places in all the senior valley Jay's is open seven days a week they're open until three PM Monday through Wednesday and they're open until eight\nThirty PM Thursday through Sunday serving delicious daily lunch and dinner special breakfast is served all day long Jay Z has catering available to they put home at home style that Jay's home style cooking just south of the unique don't in Cedar falls [noise]\n\nBusiness every lions with today's baseball trivia question for instance this one [noise] my name is ...
