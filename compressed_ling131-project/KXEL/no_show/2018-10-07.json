they were going to you don't meet I mean he's starting to look\nThat up there but you're young you know\nI don't know if you don't have to pay to get started on him he can get a fan\nYou know somebody

going to say that but I don't know why they get a pending Toyotas hops\nYells no limit to what I mean I Know he bought a paid I told her that's positive in a lot of those joke I'm One of those animals all the slam lined up for general is\nAs they come to reality when they come face to face with getting a job with seeing what it's like to deal with the government wasn't having things done and they know the failures that they study anything about social they know it fails if they read about Venezuela they know that is a dismal failure\nIf they look at health care in different countries in the world people signed up for health care and they don't have to pay for it but on the other hand they also don't get medical care when they have a heart problem they have to wait nine months to get a heart surgery\nAnd they may die before they ever get treated so what kind of health care is that so when these people start looking at the real world and being part of the real world when they get out of college they find out socialism is and what they thought it was\nAnd I also think it's common I went through a phase I was raised conservative that in college I went to just like this liberal phase and you start questioning your parents police and you have to find out for yourself and then now I'm super conservative so I think that's part of the process that what that does concern me as\nThe less strategy to try to impeach president Donald Trump and they still can't accept the fact that the voters didn't want Donald Trump what do you think is going to happen about the impeachment of President Trump\nIt's going to go absolutely nowhere [laughter]\nYou know it really is and they don't want to admit it before the twenty Eighteen elections because that will tend to have people vote against them\nThe American people do not want Trump impeached he's doing a fantastic job is dealing in the north Koreans these dealing with the Chinese well he's dealing with the Russians like they haven't been dealt with before tough\nHe's dealing with Middle Eastern problems quite well\nHe's on down the Iranian deal he's renegotiating adapter to where we have a good deal now with Mexico and maybe a good deal with Canada is well it just goes on and on and on the economy is booming that GDP was stopped from Fort from one percent currently to four point two percent\nThe current quarter it looks like it's going to be even higher weren't looking not too far away from five percent growth and GDP which is absolutely phenomenal and you recall President Obama\nSaid the American people would have to get used to know growth that one percent was all the growth in GDP we could expect\nAnd they also said there's no way for people to talk about creating jobs in magically create them out of the air well guess what\nHe's been proven wrong by Trump Trump has created an enormous number of jobs we now have more jobs available than people to fill them that's incredible not long after the Democrats\nAre saying this is our wave of the future we're going to have to get used to living like this with no growth [laughter]\nWithout that socialism is big failure\nThat it's a credible get this in the past forty nine years has been only eight months were unemployment has been below three percent in ... under President Trump those eight months of really under his administration so we've seen the stock market take off since he was elected right\nIt's not quite a bit it keeps breaking records it's hard to keep up with it consumer confidence is how I ended up that came to the economy is confidence by consumers and they do because they have a president who knows what's good for the economy is doing a phenomenal job an impeachment is going to go nowhere\nBecause first of all the American people are happy with his job impeachment is a political process you get rid of somebody you don't why basically\nPeople wanted a businessman finally in the White House instead of an establishment Republican or Democrat that had never really held that job or had a business or was successful so we thank God for his intellect\nBut when you think about it literally trillions of dollars of new will has been created under President Trump with his policies\nAnd was foreign investment American corporations have come back into this country they've invested back into this American economy but don't expect the mainstream media to report all of the city can only attack President Trump I mean if Trump could walk on water they say well look I Can't swim I mean there's nothing you can do to make anything good about Trump\nYeah let me add something and what you just said you call them the mainstream media\nI think we need to get rid of that language because there are no longer the mainstream media twenty sixteen was a historic presidential election we got a new mainstream media\nIf you look at ABC NBC CBS New York times Washington Post they are largely discredited their credibility over and over again they've been found to give fake news is that a real news\nSo their credibility is lost and that's part of the reason they're no longer the mainstream media I call them the old brain stream media\nBecause they used to be let's face it their business models are broken you see layoffs UC editors getting laid off you see ABC News I don't know if you know it but their headquarters building is going to be torn down\nTo turn it into condominiums and that tells you something to lose your office building and there's another old mainstream media company\nThey've lost a lot of office space they've had to get rid of it because they can't afford to people or the space the fact that their business models are broken as a sign they're no longer mainstream they're not at the top of the heap\nThe top of the heap right now is talk radio such as yourself people listen to you all over the country\nAnd also besides talk radio some of the social media have involved for example Drudge Report people go to the Internet to get a lot of their news so that's\nWhat I was gonna say sixty seven percent of people get their information from the Internet it's phasing out people watching nightly news and if any news they watch Fox News I mean that's the number one rated news channel and it's conservative\nThat's right and not only that but people who aren't real time news they don't want to just wait until the end of the day to see the nightly news that they used to watch\nThis old mainstream media is no longer mainstream and these giant CBC CBS NBC New York times Washington Post time Newsweek\nAnd with their credibility falling so much so that they're seeing just as a propaganda machine part of the Democratic party with their revenue drops in ... ... what's gonna happen is going to be taken over just grew into business I\nThink they're just kind of kind of go out of business or kind of like a after\nThought a lot of businesses hanging on by a thumbnail you know they just barely stay in business and they have their little niche their little two percent of the market\nOr something but over time will probably go out of business that's like any other business and the people on it they're not they're just too propagandize people they're not a wing of the government and they have to show a profit\nOr else they're not meeting their customer needs and the people are mean customer needs are the ones who are providing real news not fake news\nYou predict that our whole nation is going to become more concerned\nBut the needs are the ones who are providing real news not fake news\nRight you predict that our whole nation is going to become more conservative so we might have more conservative news and even these stations that are so far a liberal left it might become more conservative people themselves might become more conservative\nYeah absolutely they'll sort of get on the bandwagon we're also going to see what I call a renaissance and the culture that's the university's turning more conservative now that's pretty radical\n'cause a lot of those professors are Marxist and socialists but on the other hand the trustees the alumni the ones who make the donations to keep the school's running they're not happy\nSeeing the lack of free speech you know conservatives being screamed off campus and not allowing them to speak that's not acceptable to a lot of people including liberal Democrats of old because\nSome of these Democrats said well I'm a Democrat 'cause that believe in government doing things but I'm not in favor of giving a free speech the they're getting upset about the lack of free speech on college campuses with kids in high school not allowing to write an essay that's pro Trump getting an app on their grade because they're pro Trump\nAnd these people are taking actions on some of them are joining school boards were getting conservative school boards there's one in the suburbs of Denver their school board has mandated\nThat the constitution taught really upsetting features there [laughter]\nBut but that's kind of thing that's part of this conservative cultural trend where people saying back to basics we've got the best constitutional world wants to teach it we've got the best country in the world was celebrated let's go ahead and get rid of corruption in government\nAnd let's let everybody speak their mind it's fine if you want to be a socialist you can say all the good things you can think if there's anything to say about socialism it's good\nIf you want to defend Venezuela Cuba good for you but that doesn't mean that me who likes a conservative country should be shut down and shut out and that's what happened on a lot of campus\nThat's a good point the left doesn't want to win the the left doesn't want to have a debate at all you said the YouTube Google Facebook Twitter and other social media giants are using their website to censor a conservative views\nIf that's just not right in addition to the erroneous reporting later shown to be false or fake news\nThe liberals are using their platforms these Internet platforms to really silence or voices so what can be done do you want legislation to regulate these social media giant\nTrump has already promised that he will not allow censorship of conservative ideas and he can do it in a number of ways like by proposing legislation let's take an\nHour I suppose you call a prize and say I I Want a new cell phone and they say fine what's your political position you say oh I'm a conservative\nPart of the effort to where North Korea

and the list goes on and on it's a huge problem\nWhat does vitamin D actually do in the body what is it used for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D

[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking for this man had a God given purpose when life is created when we are blessed\nWith such a great gift we may see it as merely inconvenient not worthy of having right now has this new life is it in a way of the plans we have made for ourselves\nThroughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not wanting to raise children with birth defects to those concede due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils lives as we are we may no longer see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting sin has caused us to become towel a sub seen life as having great value from the one who gives it\nDid as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said it\nWould do it could\nBring a disabled child into this world possibly brain what purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring chair for a long time stripping them of their ability to be active citizen\nEven though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away it isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today\nAnd until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nWe need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may have been shocked us at times\nLooking at strangers seeing how they are dressed or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own but what if we are wrong what if our sitting written reason cannot be\nAnd we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image\nOh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold cell value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness\nYou see all were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it\nAnd God loves us so much that he wants that all would be saved\nAnd if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not\nAnd as Christians we cannot be complacent about this issue\nWe cannot claim to see God by his word to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exists today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter are\nHe should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives yet using evil for good as God does all lives how purpose\nWe may not see it as crowded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils wise but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he\nIs you see God is a Serbian king\nEach action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen\nThinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYet morning none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to the bus\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserves nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how lucky you are you must see how enemies as we are God's still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him\nAll lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts maybe then we can see how his love extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect\nTo be burdens are precious in the eyes of God those who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant says to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive loved in return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he drives us into deeper understandings up his plan and purpose amidst the\nChaos now\nIf you are listening and you have gone against that which God wish for you to have taken a life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain I\nEncourage you not to hide in the shadows where the double once you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center the last the broken\nThe one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age and in that there is much to be thankful for\nThe life giver our lord and savior seats to give us life eternal in him he wants to share of his love that you would share his love with others also\nI mean we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purposes God declares us to be for the whole children our heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward me we thank the lord always for valuing our lives enough to save them\nFor there was nothing greater to be thankful for today man a father who spared not even the life of his son to save ours\nAnd trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life\nThat never ends me that piece which passes all understanding keep their hearts and minds in your lord and savior Jesus Christ in his name we pray all men\nTo learn how you can support worldwide outrage of loose or an hour ministries go

I'm a good mood like Ben Carson there you go now is a true you're going for all this talk about you end up ... are you going to go play golf with the president today\nYet and I'm not going to give him any strokes you know this third term things looking better and better then hope you when you're doing that [laughter]\nIs that maybe the [laughter] out is that may be the end of it All right and now we want to run the other side democratic senator\nBen gardening joins us like all but one of those democratic colleagues he voted against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is that at our garden welcome back to Fox News Sunday and I apologize for him to praise and you and I know that I was\nGoing to be with you and Lindsay and I work on many issues together or we certainly disagree on on this one\nOkay let's talk with the bottom line what impact do you think justice Kavanaugh will have on the Supreme Court how dramatically drastically do than he was a little bit to the right\nWell this is Justice Kennedy's seat and Justice Kennedy was a balancing that a factor on the Supreme Court we're very concerned about protecting the progress we've made on health care issues on women's constitutional rights on\nProtecting the mall or investigation so all those issues we think are at risk and it's going to put it I think more interest on the Congress in the United states to protect healthcare to protect women's rights and protect that no one's above the law\nBut doesn't a president of getting back to Capitol does what President deserved broaden deference when he chooses a justice for the Supreme Court as long as that person is in the judicial mainstream and I think we all agree that he's certainly to the right side but he's in the judicial mainstream\nI mean the fact is democratic presidents are going to appoint liberals and Republican presidents are going to point conservatives don't don't as as Senator Graham said that President Trump won this was an issue in the campaign doesn't he deserved deference when he picks a conservative justice\nI don't believe the justice Kevin ... and the mainstream of judicial thought take a look at his decisions there's a trend every one of those decisions where he was in the minority or he was deciding vote it wasn't on behalf of special interest will be half of the powerful against the individual consumer cases environmental cases labor cases one after another\nAnd then his response to Dr Ford where he showed that he was not a didn't have the judicial temperament\nAnd he wasn't impartial leaves partisan I think those issues really came out during this process and it does concern us as to whether he'll be an independent voice on the Supreme Court and the check and balance in our system\nAnd Senator Graham pointed out he had the lesson is twenty five twenty six or judges that are all members of the courts of appeal I was in the state Supreme courts now I'm not asking you but I mean my guess is the new and Chuck Schumer and a lot of Democrats who say not a single person on that list is a member of the judicial mainstream\nSo Chris the way it should go away the former presidents have done they developed a less not an outside group\nThey're the ones who developed the list and yes they do talk to the members of the Senate before they make the nomination and try to narrow the last two one that will be more acceptable or among the United states senators that that's how the process that when when ... president he talked about Democrats or Republicans on the Judiciary Committee before he made\nHis his announcement that's the way the process should go you don't take it outside list by an outside group\nBut haven't Republicans been less political about Supreme Court confirmation than Democrats I Want to put some statistics up on the screen take a look at how many ... democratic nominees have gotten since Bill Clinton\n... these are the Democrats appointed by Clinton and Obama from Ginsberg what Ninety six votes to Kagan was sixty three now take a look at the Republican nominees by Bush forty three and now President Trump from Roberts was Seventy eight to Kavanaugh\nWith fifty ... Senate Democrats have been much less likely to cross the island vote for a Republican nominee than Republicans have been developed for democratic nominee\nBut let me also point out that even though some of those ... sixty ... the filibuster was not used until Judge Gorsuch to change the number from sixty to fifty that put us in different quarter so the change that Senator McConnell made to rules when the Supreme Court really caused us to be much more partisan in this sense within us aren't as\nYou guys did at first and twenty Thirteen not for the Supreme Court but for lower court judges and we may not know\nHands on an airplane I agree but you go back and forth of course the Republicans blocked President Obama or putting anyone on the court of appeals in the district so we can go back and forth here my point is is\nWe need to have a president who will consult with Congress the United States Senate before he makes those nominations have an open process reconsidering nominees not restrict himself to the federal side\nShould how big an issue do you think this will be in the midterms if Democrats have already been mobilized Republicans are saying you gave him a political gift fire opposition and that this was going to energize Republican\nI think it's going to a boil down to our concerns about whether we are going to protect against we've made in healthcare on preexisting conditions where we are concerned about the more investigation being interfering with I think yes\nWho are concerned about when we were going to protect the gangs we've made in health care or preexisting conditions where we are concerned about the more investigation being interfering with I think yes a constitutional right to women are those issues are going to be on the ballot in mid term and judge Kavanaugh underscores those issues\nSenator carton thank you thanks for coming in always a pleasure to talk with you sir but up next Kavanaugh's confirmation as a big victory for conservatives but will there be a lasting costs to Congress in the court will bring in our Sunday group to discuss the fallout packaged [noise]\nHere's a special message for those of you who owe the

as well right now [laughter]\n\nUse as it happens it happens now [noise]\n\n[noise] before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our\nEnergized Republican voters I Want to take a look at a polling let's put it up\nYou know pulling July Seventy eight percent of Democrats said the November elections are quote very important compared to sixty percent of Republicans but in a new poll that ten point intensity or enthusiasm gap as now shrunk to a to point to eighty two percent for Democrats eighty percent for Republicans what is it\nAbout the Kavanaugh confirmation process that you can cause mobilize your voters\nI think it's been a combination of things that Democrats have doubled down on ... to the earth but that's has brought all of that to the forefront with the ... the cats of interruptions during the hearings and now\nWith that we're campaigner judge Kavanaugh holding these allegations back towards to the eleventh hour I think Republicans have woken up and said reckon that's a very clear choice do we want reside with is strapped to lay\nA dysfunctional Washington and and there are putting the result three point seven percent unemployment ... new jobs in this country so it's a pretty clear choice between which parties delivering and which party distracted\nSome analysts say that this new energy ah what other comical to political gift of the capping off case or it will help you more in Senate races in state races statewide races\nThan it will in house races particularly in suburban districts let me put this up on the screen in a recent Quinnipiac poll when voters were out the generic ballot question who do you back in your house district\nForty nine percent said the Democratic candidate while forty two percent said the Republican so it's still plots seven for the Democrats is\nIn your house district forty nine percent said the Democratic candidate while forty two percent said the Republican so it's still plot southern for the Democrats is the Kavanaugh bump if there is any plane differently in house and Senate races\nIt's not it's helping across the board and house and Senate races were saying that in that generic ballot has narrowed it was double digits now it's at seven but I'm looking at every race across the country about thirty that are within the margin of error certainly districts where Hillary Clinton won or we have Republican incumbents\nAre jumped to turn out our base first army base is completely energized right now and the Kavanaugh hearings had just highlighted how important this election is for them\nBut in a house races we also see a big gender gap and again let's put up the numbers men diaper Republicans to control Congress by three points forty seven percent a forty four women back the Democratic candidates to control Congress by twenty five points fifty eight percent\nTo thirty three and won't the capping off site where Republican uh sided with the male accused over the female accuser only add to that gender gap\nRepublican sided with the process and the rule of law and the presumption of innocence it had nothing to do with male versus female they said this is our standard for our country\nA doctor for did not produce any evidence that added to allegations nobody that she named at that party has backed up that story and Republicans have said we're not going to change the way we conduct the law in this country suburban white women which I happened\nTo be one of them educated women we look at that and said we agree with their profits and I was out to be a Nissan right after the Kavanaugh hearings and suburban Detroit where I live one of these battleground districts and everyone was talking about it and they agreed with the important but I mean the old\nShows that there is a gender gap\nThere and there was an twenty sixteen with women at especially college educated women I'm going to these Trump rallies I've noticed in the past three I get the demographics more women are showing up than men ah we have seen and insurgents have new online donors it's coming from women and men I\nWe have to do I work with women but ... Democrats ... lemon a single issue voters we treat women as the whole voter they care about health care they care about the economy they recognize that for a million jobs have come back to this country they recognize\nYou and I never had a twenty five percent a gap twenty five point gap between ... ... women do Democrats versus Republicans but well they're just being fooled by the Democrats and ... and what it was a single issue be\nWell the thing unless you with the cat and I always abortion rights I mean Democrats tried to mobilize women by saying\nA ... ... if Kavanaugh to the bench and women are going to die I mean that's the type of hyperbole in rhetoric they're putting forward Susan Collins highlighted that and in their speech they want to make it about abortion rights were talking to women about the economy about health care about results that are happening that could be making people's lives better to wait his are up\nUnemployment at a record low women our whole issue voters\nThen there is President Trump who this week went after ... lousy for it at a rally let's let's do something about\nDo you think it was it was one of them I'll do it how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago and I don't\nThink that's helpful was suburban Republican women you know I was with the president that day it was more about the media the media was printing stories about Brett Kavanaugh and vibrant and then I ... in\nThe media was focusing on an ice fight with Brett Kavanaugh that they were focusing on everything he had done it in the sixteen and Seventeen year old boy and they were not being fair\nAbout recognizing the inconsistencies in her testimony and to say yes she doesn't know where it was when it was who was that ... who drove for their who drove her home that is fair and why didn't the media give that the same attention that they gave to Brett Kavanaugh as they destroyed his character\nEven without the ... confirmation which is obviously a big victory for the president this was one of the best weeks of the Trump presidency finalized a big trade deal with it gives me with Mexico and Canada are at and we also saw those unemployment numbers come out on forty three point seven percent the lowest\nSince Nineteen sixty nine is the economy still the strongest issue you have going into these midterms\nYeah we'll be putting forward I Try to voters a\nResult first resistance are you better off than you were two years ago our jobs coming back to this country have we had to turn around is our military being funded as I said sounded like all those things we can say yes because Republicans have delivered it was all\nDemocrats are running under this obstruct they're not being shy about it they want to bring more to function you already talking about more hearings that they want to put in place that they get the house impeachment hearing it is a very clear choice for voters and I think the economy is a driving factor\nThat will help us keep the majority\nMisery dentist IQ thanks for your time especially during this very busy home stretch of the campaign

Republicans there is a division in the Republican Party between conservatives who are maybe not Trump voters probe skeptic at least\nA and Trump's pocket a populist base who do voted for him in spite of him being a Republican not because he was one of the coalition was afraid they agree on this one because of the conservatives care of the most about the Supreme Court than any other issues that

C. dot com\nThat's premier advisors L. L. C. dot com you can also give him a ... for for\nFor two for plant that's the easiest way to get a hold of them eight for for for two for playing call that number get yourself on the appointment counter for a new costs no obligation consultation talking about your own situation and what that guys will come in how are you\nGoing to be here Mark I'm looking forward to the show and ah so what's your your force they always great to be here mark\nThat gets pretty should you have enough time for me this week as we tried to talk about the world of finance and investing in retirement yeah we got some interesting conversations to have today I Want to talk a little bit kick things off about some irreversible decisions you know we could certainly go all sorts of direction that the year made a decision your life that you wish you could take\nBack [laughter] I think they were talking last hour\nSure it it's just today alone right so there's plenty of decisions we faced with and then the retirement planning processes you guys clearly no there are some decisions you really can't undo\nNow maybe you can maybe there's going to be some people out there listening to this they wait a minute I think we couldn't do that and you're probably right there's a few technical caviar will probably costs so that as well but for the most part these decisions really can't be done so\nThey're really important to get 'em right the first time so we'd have to you know we have to obviously start with Social Security\nEveryone kind of knows that you know once you activate it you kind of set it you're kind of done it's on there are some caviar narrow let's talk about why it's important to get it right the first time\nSure absolutely one of the main reasons why you want to make sure you get it done right the first gardeners that if you make a mistake or or change your mind with Social Security or give you one year and where are you can have a redo you can\nMake a mistake so you know or change your mind with Social Security they give you one year in which uh you can have a redo you can kinda cancel your decision\nCaviar ideas you have to give the money back with us you know find all areas probably meant it right right right so if you've if you've already started to use it to pay the bills are recover dead or anything like that that's where it can get a little if he is if you change your mind\nWe don't want you to have to go back into debt in order to pay the Social Security administration back but\nPart of the reason why you might consider that why somebody might change your mind is that may turn out that they don't really need the money to live off of or if they weren't really aware that you know there's a a roughly thirty percent reduction if you take it at age sixty two verses full retirement age\nWhere we didn't realize that ah every year past full retirement age you can get an eight percent permanent bump up in your benefit all the way up until late seventies so if somebody didn't really explore their Social Security decisions that maybe what gives him pause for a thought maybe making a change when you say soldiers\nYeah the other thing about Social Security and and being irreversible decision would be you want to make sure that you're getting it right the first time because again you only get that one chance to\nTo change it in that first year but you got to understand how ... going to work and what you're trying to accomplish with it\nHe had to find out you know are you going there'll be working and they're going to be before full retirement age because then it can actually\nThat income to start eating into your benefits find out what it's going to do tea tax wise as well so it's always very important to look at the different ways to turn on your Social Security and the different times turn on your Social Security\nEspecially if you have a spouse that there's an age difference between you and your spouse there's a lot of factors that go into it\nAnd uh you need to talk to somebody that works with it every day whether it be a Social Security officer or somebody like us that I can sit there and look at all the different options are available to you to make sure that it's fitting what you want it to do and I'm making sure that your maximizing your benefit at the most\nDreary some he made some good points and you actually sparked a in my head something that ah neither of us covered that may be important to our listeners out there\nIs that you know starting your Social Security there may be as Jason mentioned some tax ramifications there's what's called a provisional income calculation\nThat if somebody doesn't know what that is it's something we can go through in our office or or you may be able to look it up online as well but also with people don't realize is that if you start Social Security and you're still working Social Security may reduce your benefit depending on how much money you make if you go over some certain threshold so that may play into the decision as well\nYeah and obviously you know Jason mentioned as well you know consider this for just you're not just yourself but yourself and your spouse sometimes I think we get so wrapped up and getting things going that we kind of forget to look at the the whole team picture if you will and of course as a couple\nYou know when you're hitting retirement you want to make sure you're having those conversations with your advisor about what's going to be best for both of you a short long term sometimes there's the strategy of\nOn the person who maybe makes less trying to hold off as long as they can things of that nature so always have a conversation with your financial advice and if you'd like a second opinion that's one of the reasons we do the show to give you some things to think about the team can certainly help you out there\nAnother place guys for the decision that I really can't undo is electing the spousal benefits if you're lucky enough to have a pinch and whether you take it or not you've got to make sure that it's going to be the right choice before you get it done\nYeah you're absolutely right mark this is one of those ... things and I'll give you an unfortunate event that occurred that I had to deal with and that is I had a client who previous before I met them actually had their pension on and and they're working and he passed away and\nThe wife was expecting that income to continue and it didn't and we really had to make some adjustments and it was all because you know they saw the flashy biggest number for for the single life benefit\nAnd that's one thing that you got to look at when you do go into our time if you're fortunate enough to have a pension\nThat sometimes that you'll see that first benefit and you'll see that larger amount of a monthly benefit and you won't even think twice about it\nAnd you had to choose that one when again you have to kind of considered the whole team and that would be your spouse as well\nEspecially if you're spouses younger and has maybe a better history of health and their family there's a lot of different factors that go into it again\nBut once you turn that on a it's permanent and so you want to make sure that again what you want to achieve it set up correctly the first time and again can't reiterate there's enough\nSit down with somebody that deals with this everyday knows the different options that are available how it's going to affect your overall outcome and then choose the plan is going to ditch your needs\nThe America and also like to point out you know every pensions a little bit different than the max in terms of\nThe options they offer they may offer similar calculations but a lot of times they'll explain it or have a name listed for it's a little bit different when you look at a pension some will offer a lump sum option also uh outside of just selecting a spouse or benefit\nMost pensions oh we'll have a single life calculation just on the the one employee and the other calculations that they'll have if there is a spouse will benefit will either be\nAnywhere between fifty to a hundred percent spouse will benefit usually in twenty five percent increments and Jason pointed out you want to look at your pension statement to find out what are the options and\nWhat are you really need for your family and what do you want to have covered in the event something happens you your your spouse's is taking care of so\nGoing through that checklist understanding what options are they're individuals have ... for example there are some spouse benefits there but they come with\nSome life insurance carriers on on some of the options you know and so there's a lot of different variables there sometimes divers will also offer a lump sum benefit and it may or may not be the best option for you to maximize what you can get out of the system\nSome people will name a lump sum of cash that they can manage other people will need for lack of better term a cup of gets filled up each month and that they can spend that no that don't get refilled each month and that's what keeps them on budget but really going through the checklist of things that you need goals income wise when you're doing retirement planning\nPension options really factor in as well and if Jason mentioned you really should look into finding the professional to help you manage through all those choices and make the best one for\nYou also want to look at you know on the other side of things if you choose a retirement date and it turns out look I I probably shouldn't retired you may have lost some health benefits to yeah especially if this happens before age sixty five and you're no not yet old too old for\nMedicare so there's a lot of things that go into retirement date not just\nPicking at but realizing the ramifications pros and cons of when you choose to a kind of hang up your hat and are going to retirement\nYeah I'd say the one thing I'd have to add to that as we were talking you know most of the stuff that that Tony was talking about was retiring a little bit earlier than anticipated and having to go back to work but it goes the exact opposite way too and that's where it's more irreversible because\nMaybe you want it to retire you just never thought you could any wait it out for five ten years and then finally retired and turned out oh we got way more income coming in than we ever will need I should retire ten years ago you can never make that time back into\nThe biggest thing that it comes down to is just putting a plan together taking a few moments a couple of hours out of the day\nGetting all of your information put together and having somebody go through with you and put together a sound financial retirement plan for you or it's really simple to do find out what your expenses are\nHow much does it take for you to live every month how much income will be coming in you know when you really truly want to retire\nWhenever that date is\nYou know inside okay is it better to turn on income now through Social Security is it better to maybe pull money out of some my investments maybe we can live off savings for a couple of months and pro long you know turning something on there is a lot of different factors that go into it but if you take the time to put the plan together\nThen you can have a better idea of when you should retire\nSo that you're not missing out on the opportunity of retiring early or if that's what you want to do and also making sure that you're working long enough\nTo sustain your retirement throughout your life\nAnd it's real simple to do like I said we need some information we need your expenses we need what income streams potentially could be coming in and what's your investment accounts are and how they're invested and we can put together what's called a retirement analysis which is going to project our retirement looks like for you\nUsually takes about an hour to go through all that information and then after about a week of putting everything together\nWell how come back in sit down review everything with you and find out if when you want to retire is going to work for you and if it's not what are the steps that you need to take to make sure that it does or when is a better time to retire\nAnd the best way to do that is to come in the U.S for about an hour will have something here for you to drink while half price and cookies or some candies as well but we want to get to know you get to know what your situation is so that we can help you out\nReally great offer from Jason in the team here on a new retirement reality from premier advisors you\nKnow Jason when you're saying that kind of stuff there and you're saying get some of these things together and bring him in some people all play devil's advocate might be like oh I got to find all of this but you guys actually help them out you send out some information and\nSome things to help get them started in that correct to kind of so they know what they're looking for\nAbsolutely you know when you call into a number you'll have somebody to talk to they will send out a packet that gives you all the information that you'll need to bring in yeah and again not to daunting no it's not too daunting and it's yeah it's as much as you want to bring in as well the only cabinet I'd say to that is\nThe better information we have\nTo clear the pictures are going to look good point so yeah if you only bring in bits and pieces it's really difficult for us to put that plan together but you know most people understand how much it takes for them to live each month it might take you know Fifteen minutes to sit down and saying okay this is what our utilities are this is how much food and gas\nThings like that but they're going to know that the other information we can gather through statements we can gather through Social Security statement finding out if you have a pension there's a lot of different things that we can do to figure that information now that said the biggest thing that you've got to bring in\nIs one of those expenses in one of the goals and dreams that you wanted to achieve in retirement so that we can add that to the plant as well as\nWell so to get started folks Cali for for for to for a plan\nThat date for for for two for planets Jason mentioned leader contact information name and phone number\nAnd there are a great team will call your baggage is scheduled to get that information out till you get that pack it out to you so that you know what to kind of pulled together and bring in and get on the counter for that consultation no cost around ... them to do this so get started now eight four four four to four plan aid for for for for planned this this new retirement reality\nMore to come right after this because of [noise]\n\nTime for some Cedar Rapids trivia did you notice it once and Johnson and asked him what you have all called Cedar Rapids home that's some serious things keep listening to the new retirement ... we'll make sure your retirement plans of stars [noise] hello and welcome into the shows this is a new\nRetirement reality because it's more than just investments mark kill you and your host alongside my co host today\nWell Anne welcome into the shows this is a new retirement reality because it's more than just investments mark Killian their host alongside my co host today from premier advisors joining me on the program is Jason will on board and Tony gave\nCertified financial planner they're both financial advisors that premier advisors serving us here in Cedar Rapids area but of course they also service Cedar Falls Iowa City Waterloo an all points in between people like to reach out to them online you can find them at premier advisors L. C. dot com\nThat's from your advisors L. L. C. dot com or you can just give them a jingle get yourself on the calendar and come in for consultation and a four four four to four planner and his eight four four four to four plan get yourself on the counter for no cause no obligation consultation\nWith the team let's discuss some easy way that we can ruin our retirement now that sounds a little funny at first to say that because this is a show about retirement but as you guys know proper planning you know for retirement often requires changing your mindset sometimes I Know you've got to see a lot of people come in\nAnd their minds that maybe as in the wrong place as they need to shift gears in to\nA vet retirement mode so I'll give you some some behaviors that you guys have seen in us it's talk us through how these are quick ways that we can kind of mess ourselves up if we don't you know get ourselves on the right path working with\nA good coach like yourselves to get ourselves two and three retirement so for example first one treating retirement more like a destination rather than the beginning of another part or another phase of our life\nYou know markets important to look at retirement as just another phase of life that's all we do when we put together plans we have three phases to retirement itself a go go phase a\nNo go phrase is logo phrase it's go go slow go no go you know if you look at the stages of life but\nYou really have to look at it as another adventure another aspect of what you're doing in life uh you know great savers typically make horrible spenders and sometimes people get in their own way of enjoying what they've accumulated to retirement\nYou know if you're still working it's easy to think of retirement as the end goal but you shouldn't think of it as the finish line\nYou know after all retirement could end up being longer than you're working career ... depending on your circumstances\nSo what you want to do was enact a plan that's going to make sure that your assets last instead of simply trying to reach a certain number and then assuming that you could coast through life or just\nYou know there are many things out there on certainty wise taxes medical expenses\nYou might even changed the goals or what you want to do and retirement so you don't want to look at it as a you know the end lights out that said I've got money and now you know you when you want to put a lot more emphasis in the planning what it is that you want to do and how they're going to get there\nYeah and mark I can easily see how people think that you know getting through the work for getting through my job to get to retirement isn't in game\nBecause you are you're drastically changing fundamentally what you're doing in your life are no longer do you have that nine to five job that you're going to and you're able to have a little bit more time or do you think a\nLot of people I talked to in our time and say that their life get busier and retirement especially that are going to be here for sure yeah hey exactly but the biggest changes you're going from an investment point of view or retirement portfolio point of view\nIs you're changing from the accumulation phase of your life where you've been contributing into plants trying to grow your assets and grow that nest egg as much as possible to get to retirement to the distribution phase of your life\nSo even though one part of your life is ending at that time a whole another part of your life is starting up and\nFor most people are for a lot of people you could potentially be in retirement longer than you are actually working because we're living much longer than we have in the past ...\nAnd so that's a big part of your life that you know if you quit your planning when you retire because you think that's the end ah you got a long ways to go\nYeah no for sure and I think you know how we graduate high school or college I think we should add that new term to it because now we have commencement\nA woman or we move from one face to the next and it's the beginning of one thing and it started something new so maybe we should have retirement commencement [laughter] to where we might have even move into the next one but I think it's a good point you know you you don't want to treat it necessarily at the finish line I mean you could have that as a\nKind of a milestone goal if you will but I think some people and that's the kind of the point here is\nYou got to really look at it and compare apples to apples or you could begin to integrate very low rate without realizing ten Fifteen Twenty years down the line that rate's gonna increase and that's really where the fine print on these types of things comes into play\nOkay so definitely want to make sure that you're having those conversations understanding and having those expectations set as this hold true Jason as well for maybe the annuity side where the fees wind up being altered I guess it's probably not an all types of annuities maybe more the variable\nWell yeah you're absolutely correct in that that variable annuity typically have higher fees and any other types of annuities that are out there but it can go across the spectrum of investments as well for higher fees than what you're anticipating you know perception doesn't quite always need expectations and that's\nOne of the things that kind of irks me when when we sit down with people and uh they have other investments somewhere else and they didn't fully understand how those investment worked or what the expense is worth to it or what the fees word to assert rider on certain things\nBecause what you want to do is you don't want to just show the flashy parts of what an investment is going to do you want to work through the goods and the bad because there is now one golden egg investment out there\nEvery time you get a benefit from an investment you're taking away something else and so\nYou got to set up expectations to understand what the fees are going to be inside of the investment because there might be a really good reason why you're using something that has a little bit higher fees\nBut typically when it comes to annuities the variable annuity you will have higher expenses inside of there because you have a mortality expense ratio\nThat's in there that kind of protects the the principle that you put into the variable annuity contract but you also might have some additional riders that you didn't or were unaware of when you first set it up and those can add to those fees that you're going to be paying every single year\nOn top of that variable annuity typically use what are called sub accounts which basically come down to being mutual funds and those mutual funds will also have expenses involved with them as well\nAnd so if you're going to use a variable annuity you want to make sure that your understanding what those expenses are and having a financial advisor talked through each and every level of the to see if you're comfortable with it for the benefits that you're going to receive\nYou want to make sure when it comes to the fine print that you are having those conversations asking questions if you're unclear and saying okay I'm not sure about this explain this to me or point that out to me and of course having a good team on your side like the team it from your advisors can always help you with that aid for for\nFor two for planned this is new retirement reality again eight four four four to four plan a couple of more here I wanted to ask you guys real fast so another place to check on the fine print Tony would be probably mutual funds Jason kind of mentioned that a little bit\nOf a moment ago I've heard people say before this sometimes you know like a mutual fund did really well and then I got into it and it started tanking ... you know is that because they're not looking at the fine print or what can we take from that\nWell there's actually several variables there could be potentially work okay you know and and anybody who's investing whether it's a stock mutual fund a new any anything investment related there's always the ... and then hopefully people have heard of before you know the past performance doesn't guarantee future results\nAnd it's important because what happens in the future may not be an identical scenario to what happened in the past\nMost people looking into you know the early in a two thousand Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand we're looking at mutual funds that had\nA lot of technologies stuffed in them that weren't designed to be technology mutual funds it affected a particular company out there that almost one entirely out of business as a result and what they were doing was because tech companies tech stocks are going up\nThey overloaded and overweight or does have the ability to do so\nBut people then read the fine print about what the objective of the fun was and the the effect of it was they got great returns in Ninety nine and then fell a good chunk of the downside in March of two thousand one dot com bubble burst and you know the the performance\nTanked people looked at that and said wow that was you know that was just the dotcom era that was just the Internet coming out that can't happen again and then fast forward and there's another bubble that burst than it was a heavy burst in two thousand and eight\nFail so that's just a a a market timing type of thing but when you get into a fund that has done well in the past what you want to do is not look at just the average of what it's done over the last\nTen or Fifteen ears look at what it did in the year by year return so you can see how the management was impacted in March of two thousand now the the performance was impacted in two thousand and eight and that may give you a better gauge of of what they're really risk adjusted return as for the future and that type of thing\nWell you know the final piece ahead on this list guys was the life insurance or some people get really surprised when it you know balloons up when they turn sixty five Jason you kind of mentioned it earlier is this something to be expected that we need to be paying more attention here\nWell there's a couple of reasons why that could potentially happen one of them might be that you have term insurance at the Germans coming up and now it just goes of a year by year basis and so it can get really expensive\nThe other way as if um if you're older and you don't have a lot of cash value in an account potentially that cash value run down now your premiums go up because of the cost of insurance goes up\nAgain when we're talking about all of these different types of subjects with the fine print it really boils down to basically understanding it before you get into it so that you can set up your expectations that's one of the real reasons we really truly believe that everybody should come in sit down\nTake a look at their information take a look at their expectations and find out exactly what they want to do\nWhat I'd like to do today I'd like to offer you the opportunity to come in for a complete financial review well offer this review for free were really passionate

Silicon Valley in California Welcome back to the business news our congressmen great to have you with us again\nGreat to be back on the program well\nThis has been a busy week congressman inside and outside of politics and Amazon of course made headlines and and you've been a part of that Amazon made headlines that they're increasing their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour that's something that the un Senator Bernie Sanders have been pushing for for some time so\nWhy do you think Jeff Bezos made that call\nWell as you pointed out Senator Sanders and on about a month they could use the data set\nAnd it was a very simple port is that if you work for a billion dollar company in Amazon's case there are ... dollar that companies should pay you enough or that you make a decent wage so you don't have to rely on food stamps or public benefit but it's with Dick you'll us\nTaxpayers are having to pay for the public benefits of employees are working at one of the richest ... of the world\nWhile others argue that actually started resonating not just about Democrats but most Republicans I went on\nFox News and Tucker Carlson was supportive of it so why should taxpayers is subsidizing employees in one of the richest couple of days so I think ed Jeff they heard\nSome of that criticism is also heard of course the stories of Amazon workers we're talking about working conditions wages\nAnd I gave him credit for let's say get raising wages to Fifteen dollars which is a pay raise but if we added at fifty thousand at Amazon workers\nYou know and and congressman real kind of ladies and gentlemen from California is what this what you don't ... that might be good for some it's Fifteen dollars an hour really a living wage because that amounts to about thirty one thousand dollars a year before taxes if you're working\nThat might be good for some it's Fifteen dollars an hour really a living wage because that amounts to about thirty one thousand dollars a year before taxes if you're working full time is is that a livable wage and all sectors of America\nWell it's certainly not livable and like it said that I still get valley you put it up for it but I'm certainly couldn't afford to buy a house or and so I don't think Fifteen dollars as a the end of it but it's a step in the right direction and if you combine it with\nAn earned income tax credit the wage tax credit for the federal government or you could get up to thirty five forty thousand which allows a person or to to that kind of a standard of living but uh it's a step in the right direction that hopefully raises wages aren't generally\nWell in the old story of what some give us some take us away also this week Amazon announced just the day after they announced that Fifteen dollar an hour an increase in wages they said they're seizing a offering bonuses and stock to their workers the company said they're doing simply because of the decision to increase\nPay it kinda [laughter] I\nThat was just really interesting to me they say okay we're going to give you a Fifteen dollars an hour but by the way we're going to take away any bonuses that you might have made it\nYeah I was disappointed that guy just said that I had praise Jeff Bezos that\nThat that that he had stepped up and I said look forward to fork to you at least were\nDoubled wages for two dollars at fifty cents a day the five dollars a day five dollars a day but that would be a hundred and twenty dollars today is if the dawn wage at Ford was half the country want to work to run for president you know and for it turned out to be right uh and we thought days those was taking a Sable that staff but\nThen they come out a lot of people that take it was ... but they're not going to be talking about it's taking away the stock five adults and the boat that says ah for the very very top of that stuff's problem uh and they could easily afford that so uh I've\nStill praise Jeff Bezos has decision but I think it short sighted to take away the bonuses of some of these workers\nI Want to put this into another context if I can congressman you\nDon't have the same time that a a Jeff Bezos has been listed as the most wealthy person on the planet and then just yesterday\nFed chair Jerome Powell said that we are living in what he called unprecedented times in the the surging economy his historical that we've not seen anything like this in modern history\nYet All right and and and and\n... all of this stuff comes together we couldn't make this up if we want to do\nJust this week a study by the end he Casey foundation found that over thirty seven percent of children and families headed by young people Eighteen to twenty four were living in poverty and but it gets worse here in Iowa that number is an astounding sixty seven percent\nOf children living in low income families in other words a family to making under thirty two thousand nine hundred dollars a year comment\nBut shameful that the challenge of our time\nThe moral challenge of the economic challenge is intimate equality from a moral perspective there's no reason that a country that is producing as much wealth as many billionaires can't make sure that every working American every working American family has a decent paycheck\nAnd that's why I Believe instead of the one place for currently a dollar\nTax cuts that we gave\nTo the richest one percent we ought to have given that as a tax credit\nIn the form of a child tax credit or working tax credits to help exactly the families that what you're talking about the folks making twenty five thirty thirty five thousand dollars folks were hard by the way it had a pay raise and that's why we need to\nIncrease the minimum wage as an economic perspective the biggest challenge for economic growth is we need people to buy stakes\nAmazon is it going to succeed if they don't let people buy dad lives on packages we need people to get enough to be able to buy steaks and this growing in Tempe disparity that threat to the middle class really threat the bedrock of what made America great I get all the superpower\nOn our news make a line rope Connor ladies and gentlemen he's a congressman from the seventeenth district of California is is a return visit for the congressmen and we certainly do appreciate your time sir final question if I can I you coming back to Iowa anytime soon\nWell that that in the near future where they have been working on that is a great project in Jefferson, Iowa or there is is unbelievable project at Jefferson where they've got twenty five kids learning to dance computer science\nAnd in high school and the the the double in college and a link Kroger from pillar technology came out to visit ... Silicon Valley\nI connected with a number of tech companies were cried together that they should have of Silicon Valley\nThat hire some of these kids\nAre and create jobs a partnership between Silicon Valley Jeffress said if that comes together that are coming out of it that's the type of partnership or we needed our country between places like Silicon Valley in rural America to create jobs and wages and opportunities for people everywhere in this country\nYou know I I just I just told them to miss truth a congressman I so I was the last question but I Do have one other when you're talking about the tax cut it in jobs bill that was signed into law back in December or coming up we have the mid term elections so is there I mean is there if\nDemocrats wreak take the house at any rate is there an opportunity to review that law and others\nI think there is a and I think there is a place where we can have a bipartisan that's as I wrote it off the wall Street Journal of all places and I said you want to talk about tax cuts\nLet's talk about tax cuts tax credits for working families in expanding the child tax credit that expanding the earned income tax credit that's money that goes into the pockets of the\nLeft behind and even people like Rubio and coal rioted the past have praised those programs led to repeal the tax cuts that way for the one percent but let's start\nDirecting the tax cuts at working Americans who need it was a that's what I Will push for a if we're fortunate enough to take back the majority\nWell thank you very much again congressman bore spending some time with this year in the business news hour appreciate that\nYou'll hear the entire story from an amazing young woman who was beat back the odds that is coming right up\nInside on business the news hour has made possible through the support of Aryan look your business needs you to focus on your business so why not leave the age are duties to experts like are you on a jar from on boarding to compliance to payroll and anything in between\nLearn more at a U.

through we're going to be talking about something you may or may not have heard about\nBefore it's called the guardian scholars foundation now what the heck did they do and why we got to find out our\nGuest is Nicole ... and she's been working with the guardian scholars foundation for some time she's also interestingly enough latest ... with a plug in she's also a pod cast her in her own ride living in Waterloo welcome to the businesses are nice to have you here\nThank you thank you for having me\nAll right let's dig into this a little bit what is the guardian scholars foundation what are you guys do\n[noise] so what we do is really empower foster youth to argue that have been through foster care during their life experience we help them through education mentorship three star says really provide kind of that safety net for them to be able to go through school and you know have that support\nBehind them you know okay and that that that's a great thirty seconds elevators thanks yeah practice that before and I haven't actually I'm just so familiar and passionate about it that it's easy to talk about what is it that you do [noise]\nIn reality in reality I got help those kids learn\nYeah said really to help them learn I'd say the biggest part is that mentorship he is you know having that accountability uh checking in with them making sure our program is running\nProgram that's running smoothly\nWhere the coffee shop blade it\n'cause I'm going to work at this um but yeah you know the biggest part in a lot of these the if they don't have\nParents for financial compensation to help them through school or you know maybe the government assistance they get is not going to put them through to a bachelor's degree so that's where we ... we have that extra funding per student to say hey if you want to go on towards your bachelors we're going to help you get there\nWhat about the trade schools and things like that or are you strictly into the four year program just\nFour year program as of now you know who knows what could happen but um how do you find this\nHighly find it so really it's through generous donation um our\nFounder Craig ... just passed away this last coming here and fortunately and he did leave us you know really generous\nA chunk of change so to say that really now it's people donating you know so we actually have a ball and then coming up which is a fundraiser and it's really kind of it's like the old thing it takes a village you know it really does take the community support to make\nThis nonprofit happen when does it fall event so that's October twenty third coming up here soon we'll make sure this could solve with Enron what do you what are you what do you plant\nThat's what we're doing at breakfast theme really excited about that myself will be speaking along with a senator jak hatchet and a couple other board members we have right now\nJack ... yeah well he actually stepped on our board\nJackass is a good friend I'll hear them congratulations you've got a good one yeah he is he's wonderful I'm\nVery steep interestingly enough jak hatches her former senator jak hatch very steeped in health care issues and or could be or or what a great opportunity to have him on your board\nSo who gives to the guardian scholarship foundation I've yeah corporate donors as well as individuals\nBlah blah yeah you know and that's part of rate really raising awareness and getting the message out there because people don't know about it they're not able to donate of cars so\nYeah I'm really hoping that that ... me coming on board and really just advocating for the ... and we'll get large donors and more support you know it's not all about the money but it does take the money to find the scholars\nLook let's talk a little bit about the young people to cheer help how long have you been doing [noise]\nI'm just shy of a year now I came on the board of directors a but a cool part of the story I was actually a recipient of the scholarship when I was in college so that's why it's very near and dear to my heart of course\nAnd this has been going on for how long the program at south oh goodness I should have rushed up unless I'm not shy in ten years around there the reason I'm asking\nAnd this has been going on for how long the program at south oh goodness I should have rushed up on this um I'd say shy in ten years around there\nThe reason I'm asking that is I'm Wondering do you do any longitudinal studies or follow some of these young people that have been scholarship recipients\nFollowing their successful education\nYes our alumni is that do come out yet we have him on our Facebook page and our website so we do keep track kind of what they're up to now and follow through with their six sects and\nWell it sounds like a great falls and and I and and that should be really interesting for people to attend ... ... what else are you doing are you sure you're working on the guardian trawlers foundation got a compelling story what what else what\nI guess\nI Do ... cats yes yep so there's a couple of shows right now I produce\nActually allowed ... cats I think it's a great way for people to learn for free now mind you there are so many just resources at our fingertips so huge believer in pi casting and radios and all that stuff but\nAside from that I did write my book last year so February fix that last year I published my book foster that fosters and then it ended up hitting a best seller actually so I was really proud of that in my book really was kind of highlighting my Journey Through foster caring adoption the little preview we shared now\nAbbott going more in depth of all the different components that you know made me who I Am so I interviewed my biological dad which was amazing [noise]\nFirst time I heard his voice on the phone and talk to him about our story\nI really got a better perspective of you know what was going on in his mind and my biological mom mind you know all the drugs they were doing all those different things that led us into foster care because I never knew those things really you know we we knew enough\nThat they weren't suitable at the time but it was pretty amazing to be able to really interview and put some pieces together\nUm I also had my younger sister write a chapter in there uh my adoptive mom and dad so it was really cool just to be able to time I started together and kind of just have a as a visual hey everybody this is what happened to me I made it through here some inspiration for you kind of things\nSoap and inspiration for bed I\nNow know and there's so many people that I Know can benefit from my story and just having that voice and being able to speak out and being vulnerable at so many people can relate to and I just I Know that I was supposed to help people so that was kind of the driving force behind the book\nWill talk a little bit about your life\nYou were a recipient of fish I can understand why you're so passionate about it yeah what does this do for you [noise]\nSo it really allowed me more time to focus on my studies that allowed me to even go get a bachelor's degree because I was kind of on my own schooling I'm I kind of fell on a special category since I was in foster care then adopted and then back into foster care that age [laughter] and we can go over that too\nBut the age range is I didn't line up to meet the requirements where I Would be considered independent so I still had to go off of my adopted parents income\nAnd at that time they weren't you know they didn't really want to help me through school so I was kind of on my own so to say and unfortunately I didn't get many grants I didn't get you know what normal kids would in my situation\nSo the guardian scholar Sunday show how did you find out about\nOh yeah it was really kind of a strange circumstance I was at a coffee shop coincidentally\nWith my older sister and a social worker we were talking about placement with my younger brothers at that time and just kind of getting a by I have a very crazy story um but yeah we're getting some advice from her and I was telling her at the time I was going to school fulltime working fulltime\nAnd she just stopped me and asked how it was doing that and I just didn't know any better I knew I had to pay for my college and my bills so I thought that was normal I had to and she let me know about the program I applied and generously enough they gave me a scholarship so\nAll right I you know this is ... and we will talk more about the guardian scholarship foundation but the you've opened up a door here then I got to walk through for just a moment um and and I don't want to necessarily know your personal story although I imagine is probably found just from what I've heard so far\nWhat about the whole foster system and the adoption system\nI understand that there are numerous families out there willing to adopt the system picks for ever to get through\nA sometimes the foster system doesn't work as well as with has there's been a news stories about all kinds of negative issues and I know we don't hear about the positive things often but negative issues what was your experience through that whole issue\nA whole array wow yeah and again mine was unique which most cases are but I was initially in foster care it two years old\nI really stemming from my biological parents just not being sent to parent you know they really struggled with addiction the lifestyle\nPhone number is five one five three three one\nThirty two seven or get a hold of our

Texas a town of a couple of thousand people\nBut was instilled in him early on in life things like loyalty and giving back and and some of the principles in life as he said a growing up his parents strengths were ... was home port knew him\nWhen he was growing up read I mean today here well placed on the Forbes of four hundred year recognize as one of America's billionaires will you grow up it wasn't like that did you see yourself as different did you stay different did you visualize it OK I'm here temporarily but I'll be out of here one day\nNo not at all as a matter of fact I enjoy the environment that I was raised in and I enjoyed the growing up in what I'm going to have a perfect situation uh we realized that the countries in the depths of the depression a lot of people do they have jobs and that there were problems are\nAlways a was a was a just instilled in me with with every sense of the fiber\nIn my family for my mom and my dad was\nThat education was a key to the the\nOf good alive for the benefits of your life would be that would benefit you and then you could pass on a benefit to others so education was always a big thing we were fortunate we had very good public schools in our little town\nThat I was fortunate I got to go to college football scholarship and then that the bill from army service so I was able to get an education then uh it uh it was very important it's very important\nYeah Bill from army service so I was able to get an education then uh it uh it was very important it's very important to\nAll of us I've talked to a lot of kids groups are these days and try to instill in them the importance of this thing and school another week ... whatever it is if you get out you don't feel like you can spend four or five years in college to spin one years she can't do that span one semester\nBut goes every day will pay off for you every day that you can get the more formal education you can get the better you'll be\nSo uh yes we add obstacles we really didn't see them as as much a a as I guess that they might have been and maybe that kind of positive outlook a play the role in what we're able to do\nWell it's it's a it's obviously affected you in some positive laying many positive ways you are as as a young man a young boy you are on ... entrepreneurial almost from the beginning once you've\nGot a half hours I didn't even know how to spell the word was much less a\nA a understand what he was but I was always fascinated about how things work out as a\nOut of the Gabby a bank or how do you get to how how does this happen um how's it going to get on his own business or whatever the businesses I was always fascinated by it always tried to to watch him understand as much about it as I could and I still have that same fascination\nUh today is approach the age of Seventy eight or I'm fascinated about how things work I'm fascinated about how doll how Mr del up Marco Nell up and often or a a ... a\nBuilding computers and found a way to a new everybody in the world it's fascinating and I still try to learn about all those things\nYou know it's interesting to read because a lot of people say here this all the time they say well you know what they did before you can duplicate or replicate today my mind opinion is you can make a much bigger fortunes much faster ... in today's world ...\nWell I totally agree and and then there's another key element that [noise]\nThat use has such a such a premium these days are being young uh gives you an advantage\nNot a disadvantage and that is just another thing I think that spells are just so positively uh for all of the young people that are that are coming in and tackling the various elements of of careers in one way or another\nBecause there is a premium on youth and and ah it shows so I think that\nI think we're living in the very best of times uh we should understand that and we should we should see that we enjoy we enjoy a good share of it\nAbsolutely you know going back to when you were about age ten you had a very simple entrepreneurial jobs you created I'm I'm selling peanuts but I think he learned a couple of valuable lessons to not talk about that I did\nI learn a lesson that or if you put too many peanuts in the sack when you get a lot of Nichols but there's not enough to pay for all your peanuts [laughter] so what happened so what happened was convinced that they go by me another hundred pound bag of peanuts and he said well you've already tried that and he said it didn't work very well\nBut yeah I said well give me a chance I'll make it work\nSo I have as many peanuts and the second ever had any complaints from my customers and I made some money so [noise] I Know you learn a lot of lessons as you as you move through laugh I learned a lot of lessons early ages and I was still around today\nYou know you also said I mean from that experience I had a quote from your book called the red zone you said if you like he's he's in the first rule of private enterprise you identify in need and you know or the buyers are ... missing is the product and I think that you you mentioned that's what you learned I guess from that peanut business that is correct\nYour mom is quoted as also saying or your mother say I gave birth to them and raise them but I've never known what made that boy check [laughter] [laughter] you you were unlike the rest of the family will take it\nWell yeah well I I was a little bit more passionate about about the the things that I wanted to do and and I'm a that was so\nThat that's just been a part of all I have always been passionate about the things I Do and I've always enjoyed the things\nThat I Do not that there haven't been problems and issues that come up as they always do but um [noise] uh the the the right and this is a God created all of us equal certainly in one respect and that is that he gives all of us this twenty four hours of today\nIs a gift within earn it slapped and we deserve it it's God's Gift or so the issue is\nNobody else gets any more than twenty four hours today I get the same as you do everyone else gets the same issue is what we do with it and that's that's what's kind of driven my life\nAnd uh it's it's it's worked very well for me\nI get so many people like you were saying the you know you there's a premium on youth because unfortunately many people don't realize how valuable that head start that advantages if they have now until maybe it's too late or are they wasting a lot of that but that's just typical isn't arrest\nWhat it is you know we're always going to find people who who who I'm more concerned about things than others and [noise] and uh they're always going to be some people it will finish the hand of others and that doesn't mean though that you can still do well in the race of the big thing is is to get in the race and be a part of it\n[noise] rent you originally going to be a lawyer one happened\nWell I found out in a house if finishing my second year in law school I found out\nThat the that profession in Nineteen fifty\nA really didn't pay much and uh I was I was working two or three jobs on the campus and I was doing I found out that I was making more money than than starting lawyers or at that time an old it discouraging anyone from the\nFrom the field of law it's a fantastic field and we all know that but in my world I was in a hurry and uh I I just felt like I needed to to move away from la and move over to the business side\nRed isn't that one of the um a common denominator ... most successful entrepreneur is what you really alluding to hear you a sense of urgency to get out and earn a living to ...\nAnd and that made a big difference in other words you didn't at that point have the patience you said you know I can calculate going forward on this track or I can get out and get into business and what did you do you quit law school you left law school where did you know would you do rent\nI got a corporate job through the University of placements service and I had about six weeks before it open form a training class open in the meantime I had a friend or a\nIn a Corpus Christi Texas rose my parents were living at the time that was selling new foreign Jamaican Vince really come down and and the work with them\nA for a few weeks before I'm a corporate job opened up but I found out real early own within two or three weeks I really enjoyed selling cars a so called in and checked out of um a corporate job\nBill early own within two or three weeks I really enjoyed selling cars are so a a goal in the checked out of a corporate job and um but yeah we're selling cars and I like selling cars of it very well at it uh within\nThree years about able to save some money and the conventional banker that I was a was worthy of a bank loan at age twenty five I got into the used car business and then I got into\nMore used car businesses and then I got into the franchise business and and the automobile business has really been the basis of a lot of other things that have been apart um a lot of\nAnd obviously you were very successful from the beginning again in your book the red zone you stated that back then the average unit some months maybe sold by salesman were ten after you were in the business three weeks you set a goal and you hit thirty one car sales in the next thirty days which is pretty incredible starting out as much\nAnd the in the event that I Can't do that but in a a map to get discouraged with southern pretty quickly so I'm not one to stay in keep trying to make something work this law working\nAgain I think I have a plan routes I got to have the right approach to it I give it my best and most of the time it works if it does it well then I Move away and let somebody else tried\nInteresting we've had a number a guest on a who also attained high levels of success and number of them said when you're going into business plan for it to take twice as long and twice as much money than you ever initially\nThought yeah\nI don't really plan that what you have a plan that a plan that we are going to have a a almost immediately cash flow and again most of the times that make it work out you know sometimes I don't\nHave you sold any business I'm sure you have you had no soul opportunities that you're not handled\nA lot of businesses that didn't work well for me that the other guy they got it made it work very well absolutely I Can't\nSay that that I have any matters touch I Can't say that everything that I Do does work well it doesn't but when it does uh uh I'm Out of using them with a very long\nBut that's pretty cool but you fit into your own format and you're not going to deviate or that's\nCorrect that's very interesting um winters are two or three

doctors in this\nCase today and actually with Larry nor is because of doctors are out there were they were going to be having fun fun fun I Love today's topic is about taking control bipolar disorder we got a special guest coming on with us Michael pitch he\nHas a book owning bipolar and uh you know this book and it's just been released and it's something you definitely want to pick up owning bipolar it's great for the patient and the families but it's also good for practitioners\nBut before I bring him on Larry I thought we talk a little bit amongst ourselves about our own experience with people with bipolar\nWell I've been pretty open about my upbringing and your suicide so high note I mean it's a tragedy I I've had two friends whose children have taken their own lives there were ... adult children early twenties yeah\nMy both my parents had attempted suicide on multiple occasions sounds so it was in and then it occurred to me as I was in my twenties and thirties am I going to get this McGarry depressed am I going to have bipolar [noise]\nI'm pretty sure my father was bipolar\nAnd I think that we we encounter certain people he had a gambling addiction to write a gambling addiction but she had a personality disorder more than anything and so and again when the doctor comes on and he'll talk about the mood swings so er visits a track he's in a good mood is gambling her by her dad or my dad\nBut then when the losses come or used broker he has to do something to get money\nThan than the anger and the behavior pretty rough\nBut also I think in our daily lives we can do this probably people that I've grown up with it were my childhood friends that were my friends I Love them\nBut I've noticed some shift says they've gotten older some negative attitudes and behaviors that I didn't notice when I was maybe a kid or in my maybe recognize it made any harder than they do to recognize how about yourself\nYou know I had a I have a family member with bipolar and then that this particular family member also struggled with alcohol addiction\nAnd she sent that when he called a recovering alcoholic I don't recall drawing they're recovering\nAnd um she would call me like in the middle of the night and go on these ran and I have to go to work the next day while and so I had to you know it's tough because it was the ... block her number but then I always had in the back of my head what if something happened to her and I need to go there and I've lost her number\nSo I was always it I'm afraid to block or number on now she's so much better she thought he should I'm no she's she's not drinking and and life is so much better we have a really good relationship but he was really rocky\nHe was getting sky high quotes from other companies because you take ... to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found that ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select agent dams and believe me you select quarters and shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nFor your frequent calls me number advice over three Ninety five to eight hundred and five seven three Ninety five to eight hundred

shout out to all our affiliates coast to coast or on the nine stations around the country and it wasn't for our stations\nWe definitely wouldn't have a show so if you love listening to the seeing young show let your local station now to keep us on and that you love the show and if you want to come on and play medical mania trivia with us we love having our guest from all across the states come on and play with the number is eight for for well one hundred\nScientists are searching for the secrets of immortality probably first grass concept of time for the immortal\nUsually Dr Anderson's

us as always tell people people ask me do I file as I said yeah I go to sleep till nine or ten and I asked him play wake up in the morning my breakfast right [laughter]\nSo we got a great guess on with us Michael pitch he actually hold the master of science degree in clinical community psychology from California State University and he has a bachelor of science and psychology from Layla\nMarymount University and he's a great book owning bipolar how patients and families can take control of bipolar disorder and you know if you are a listener and you either have bipolar he has a family member of bipolar or maybe you work with somebody and bipolar oh my gosh this is the guy you want to talk to because he\nHas such great stop and Michael thank you for coming on and and talking to us about your book owning bipolar\nYou so much for\n... years Thirty years you light done like marriage counseling and family therapy so why bipolar why did you pick misspoke ask\nFor over Thirty years and during the course\nOf a number of political problems relationship issue for adult years ago or whatever we did I get a lot of sort of your patients referred by August\nLet that be sort of a flood of people cutting it important for me to get my hands around for a family\nStation formula going forward would treat a particular I never get my company could get parents more about how little\nThey can support for what they could make the line and a brother and I mentioned it was one particular area\nOf the nation and repeating it actually is somebody who\nDon't you for it by port of Harry on children and um\nParents expect going forward for children that are spouses caregivers family members of all kinds of specter what do we go forward struggling with disorder treatment or prior treatments [noise]\nSo it was something of the cold for me to\nDo further into it research and began to come up with a concept and ideas to help people and not just be a transitional a professional life living in\nA guy to trigger entire process\nAs it went through the research I found some what I found very interesting it's disturbing statistics\nBipolar and [noise] the surgical people with bipolar disorder or diagnosed and among those about two thirds of that\nThose people are usually diagnosed depression a lot of depression that we've seen in bipolar disorder that's very important distinction that we can talk about life but he\nWanted to point up people usually wait an average about ten years before they're treated properly but that is from the beginning of the first symptoms of bipolar disorder to where they're treated properly for bipolar disorder weighted average of nearly ... years so you can imagine that only gives me\nWhy ... why do you think that is why do you think that they wait so long and then and oftentimes they refuse treatment so\nThere's actually several reasons for that when you talk about if you treat 'em certainly\nDenial and fears treatment with bipolar diagnosed um provided or suspected and the idea is to individual we can expect that there is some element of denial lot of like\nHow people the substance abuse disorders may first denied that they have a problem a church similar sort of that perhaps for slightly different regions here there\nBut it can look very similar to that took you will recover you probably know what that looks like\nMichael ... theory to it as well\nAnd I also think that because bipolar disorder over the years I'm frankly not Danny I'm\nPart to like myself I'm which has a unique kind of characteristics of what to look for diagnostic treated\nDifferently I think a lot of people kind of fall through the cracks of the mental health system even when they're searching for answers and searching for the way he ... his libertarian\nMight Michael let me ask you a question because I find a lot of people throw the term around rather loosely the iron wrong that they don't even though like the water cooler at work or someone gets out of a relationship or has a he was a guy who are you sure that a lot and so\nSo so I think some people are probably labeled incorrectly where others might be labeled correctly but what is bipolar and how we\nCan go to a break I'm going to I Want to end on on that and I want you to be ready to answer that when we come back\nI'm Michael I you know what is it and then how do we now because I think that's real important and I got to let everybody know you're Facebooking bipolar network and yelled to have a website bipolar network dot com oh great stuff\nGot to give a shout out to our military we love you guys and gals thanks for listening we can see them downloads on the ... version of the show which is saying young so to point out we can see those across the globe so we know we have a strong military\nFollowing and we thank you for your service and don't forget to follow us on Twitter at stay young media when we come back we're going to be talking more about bipolar so if you want to know the difference\nBetween what say you know loosely used term as Larry said and what a true bipolar diagnosis well Michael ... uh the guy to tell us because he's the author of the book owning bipolar and a\nHome that night because when we come back Mary I'm going to talk to a little bit more about ... what we spoke about this first segment in the south\nThey do

[noise]\nWith people all\nThe work we got along with a family member to it because it's so critical going forward and that's really focused on creating bipolar talked about how media can be enjoyable\nShe waited till enjoyable so that people can start thinking oh I\nDon't you go through the introduction of medications that can be very trying to get a second\nYou may not get right rain a lot of these people I notice a bipolar they go they go to a solution who's not familiar with bipolar and they get put on antidepressants and then they get worse\nBecause they're not on the the writer there on the wrong medication let me just say in it because they were on the wrong combination of manager or whatever they go they go down the wrong road but it's it's kind of a trial and error with patients wouldn't you say\nAbsolutely trial and error or just a few people get it right the first time so to speak but\nIt's a struggle and particularly when\nI go to like you said they may receive adequate law which can be very agitated and often when I was lucky I get a site where\nThey get more medication because they are not\nGetting any better let me double it reacts with real problems yeah and there are no go ahead\nOh well we get the medications correct to compete and then you can look at the end hopefully very launched stabilization and that's really what you treat the person the bipolar integrate the family work as well\nFor one thing that ... that we found it you know executive medicine to Texas where people flying from all over the globe to see us for these half day physicals and sometimes we find people\nThat um it really they're doing a little bit better somewhat better and they're seen a therapist or psychiatrist and\nAnd then we find out that they have some micro nutrient deficiency is maybe their hormones are out of whack and and it's really looking at all of that together you know how do you get this patient to the to the optimal\nA health all the way around because it's real easy when you see somebody with a diagnosis of severe depression and bipolar or something has to do with you know from the neck up\nAnd you think they don't need anything else and the rest of their body\nAnd I think that's a big mistake to make a fool over\n... you know I just want to thank you Michael for coming on that and the show I Want to give everybody a website it's

[noise] your mind if I Try to slam the door and my face don't buy everything you want a bicycle you'll die every little thing no no we love and affection don't lay all then\nYou'll by many things we love and affection don't lay all then when\n\nYou say why did they tell you\nI got to have your cake\nAnd the lady at the end just runs a chill up by ... by God I get somebody's going to make that comment about me and stuff all the time I was asked um what do you say you remember\nOh vinegar like what do you remember about oh just ruined just doing it would just it was cool that we were doing something like that I thought it was really cool it was probably your idea yeah and um so I Love the idea and the movie was so great\nLike I had no idea I didn't know James Dean was a I kind of had an idea but when you actually see the movie on a relatively big screen and you and I were teenagers a good time to see that movie\n'cause he kinda connected to it in certain ways and just the idea that we did something out of the norm itself would just was really great and I remember it to this day\nYeah that that's what's amazing 'cause that's for forty ... whatever amount of years ago and like that and and it's close to forty years and I remember it as well er and most other people we went with to do that\nWe went to I see the light show or in the dining ended a planetarium earlier first time I heard a Led Zeppelin songs they played it in a planetarium ... back in the day I don't think they do it in like a ... to like show al right there to music\nWhich was again something brand new no one ever did\nAnd they would change the music like there would be different music every night\nYeah that was the Beatles night or whatever it was and so that was great fun but you're talking about ... that movie does represent a lot of the banks that some kids unfortunately even from the that was in the sixties even from a from the sixties to this day experience home life is a little difficult\nParents aren't or maybe on the same page all the time maybe parents aren't together it leads to a lot of this teenage banks which James Dean Natalie Wood and sell many oh in this movie really presented in a way that still I think universal I think in some ways\nAll the knife fights and stuff don't happen anymore too much other stuff going on in the way it was portrayed right but but I think that it it does still represent the struggles that the kids go through\nEven though Jim back as the Senate who's missing but go in there somehow the third from Africa Gilligan's Island but even he represents the father who is in that he is different generation just not understanding\nWhat this child is going through and doing what he thinks is right the materialism thing journalistic things and I I give you support and even earlier in that scene is\nHis his son his drunk and he's saying it's okay I did that when I was a kid too so he's trying what he can and there is no book to raising kids and so I don't I don't know that the the that the movie even as the father is still sympathetic in that movie he's right out of touch but he's trying\nThe grandmother or who made that last comment there's not so nice the wife is not so nice and so now you see what the struggle comes as your dad versus mom and my family so ah leaves the the kid in between so we've seen that in high school\nUm I don't know if you have any experience has anything to share whatever if not we move on but the idea is that you know there's all of us have struggles\nAt that teen those teenage years that uh I don't know it's just hard because I haven't gone through it yet with my kids hard to know how to navigate through in what the right answer\nWell the other thing is that the kids when they when your kids are in high school they don't necessarily talk to you about what they're going running through because I didn't really talk about with my parents too much ... at that [noise] but didn't express them you know one tenth of what I was really going holding\nTo if it ever got to the port was really bad something ... something really bad happens or you did something really you know then that was the symptom the last straw if you will that then you would release all of well I've been going through this the last month or whatever it is\nBut even just to be in touch with your feelings of what you're feeling into you're allowed to talk about it and it may be talking about it helps that was not in my world at all how mine\nEither no so so it gets it wasn't I was in because my parents wouldn't listen because it's the way I was I just didn't want to talk\nAbout it right and I was a teenager rice was and what and what's talking going to do like that yeah that age yeah ... ... you're talking about I Can't solve the problem by my parents are going to do right yeah exactly you know I'm\nJust a release that you know the steam if you build up and you had to leave release that vow even sure and sometimes that does help so\nYou know but also parents are paying the mortgage parents are looking to to do shopping variance of all of these if a food all these ... these obligations that you have to run and keep the house going on fortunately sometimes\nYou know the kids in the back of the cardio asking them how school or what have you or you want to hear the answer but you've got you know three minutes before you stop at the gas station\nOr whatever so sometimes they don't feel that they want to talk to you while the sitting in the back of the car\nRight yeah I've got to be a good time for them to talk to you not just when it's convenient for you right\nExactly which is what I Try to do with a big I'm up in between errands thereafter\nWhen they kinda know they're smart they are now like okay this is a window I'm getting in and screw him on that\nTalented right they don't they don't say a lot of stuff\nBut uh my wife smart wasn't she'll take some time when she's you know bathing with them and all and things slow down\nAnd she she does it a lot better than I Do is she'll just talk to them and now they're into the mode of being at least my nine year old little girl was talking to my wife a lot more about things it's great and what's going on so yeah I Hope that uh at some point in time I could slow down and and do that too with Leo I mean I think I don't know if it works and not\nThat was the son versus mom with a daughter I don't know whatever but I I Try what I can all the time but uh anyway so that's expressed very well\nAre you feeling better talking it out and you know I feel wars I feel like honestly I feel I've missed them go at this point us where the apron memory of the ... back in that scene\nIf you're if what if what if you haven't seen that movie you've got to see that movie\nRight I mean it's it's a it's real but back to what it is trying to think outside the box have some fun do some things uh you know that you haven't done before keep an open mind don't make rules about what friends you have in ... and who you're going to hang out with\nCall them all up and what was she shows up shows up to to see the movie in the theater or you know the library or whatever it might be say an old movie just as a movie's black and white by the way it doesn't mean as bad movie\nJust saying there's only better exactly how it will be back right at this ... again\nMovie that has tried to set a anyway now Andy Griffith I've\nPlayed this previously but I Love this because this now turned the tide a little bit of one of our school and how sometimes school and the subject in school can actually be fun if that makes any sense\nFor gas [laughter]\nSay ... and Brad codes and you know history for the craziest girl and [laughter]\nOh they had they had a gun and fired a shot at was her play around the world Thursday or for for what kind of the last\nOne guy that got a guy that got shot that can be heard around the world that was [laughter]\nWell uh there was this fell off you sure you want to hear their stories history\n[laughter] hey tell a story [laughter]\nSo he thought that was previously but you know the teacher can make a a you know a history and one of the subject is come alive for people like that or for this you know the students it's just a it's such an advantage such a great way to learn and you have any teachers like that ever are\nNot sure I had him in college up to ... even in college I had teachers like that they would you know\nDo something different and actually made make the subject matter more interesting ... however they want her to do whether it was like acting out old you know characters in history or giving scenarios from their own life about what happened just something that humanized it for you or made a big difference I remember that to this day\nYeah and and and I do too and and uh you don't think you you would remember or that and we'll talk about this in the next section about teachers so to speak but also the subjects themselves\nI Would say this sometimes in school or you don't know you know such a high school does this pressure going to go to college what are you going to major in what's going to do what are you going to do what do you do the rest of your life you know you're sixteen Seventeen I don't really know that\nBut maybe you know maybe that those particular subject to the talk is not your bag so maybe you could have limited at least a couple of things\nThat you know from the from the table and see what's left standing as opposed to picking one out of all of a list is that makes me sent home makes total sense so at least you know if I had any advice to give anyone possibly would listen to me for advice that that would be something at least knocks them stuff off\nFor ... and not just I don't like it or not good at it now for a real reason as you know you really not after the owner the aptitude\nFor the desire or whatever\nBut um you know the other side of things to do some things you you have skills for that you you don't like doing right next to\nYou know you you been one of the planet to to do math let's say and do the math related you don't like it but you're really great at it\nYou know that ... definitely happens so in that way you got to struggle with somebody going to go down that path and I were all given certain cards to play and it's um it's not easy to figure out how to bluff Ford or to go all in that mix center exactly so that's a it's hard so anyway ah we we took a turn\nTo the serious here and everything will just do it given our back to school and our looked back to school or is there something Mr Cohen that uh you want to add to any of these stories that we've we've we've jumped over any of these stories as there were more section left in one minute here\nNo wild run on the spot yeah put me on the spot um well I Do I remember I'm\nThinking back now you and I had gone with the whole group of people to see a movie called\nThe warriors remember the warriors I don't know if you remember seeing that movie yes and every one we went way of just love the movie and we spent and I didn't really know you that well time but we sat next to each other we spend a lot of the movie\nJust like looking each other in laughing at the movie was so ridiculous and I knew like okay I like it was like on my wavelength right you know and I think that's I don't know why it just hit me now but maybe we're talking about the James Dean moving\nWhen we went to see that but that was a connection that I I remember maybe it wasn't the first one but it was a connection I remember I had with you at the beginning where it's like ah here's somebody on my wavelength\nI agree and it was ... healthy or what would you say to me it was a a nice to see someone that's able to step out and actually not\nGo along with the crowd right because the crowd says they love this movie it was a not a good movie and it was a poor message and I was not into it at all\nAnd and I was thinking to myself am I the only person here and I for so all stand up and you know somebody has to tell them is terrible but it was nice to be able to share it with you to say you know what this is this now what's going on here and and I'm not going\nTo we're not going to be that person that goes along with the crowd brightest because the crowd says it's good to do something you know\nI appreciate that that's exactly what I I I Would basically say the same exact thing uh at this point that that's important to find some of the journal on the same wavelength with as well\nThat's exactly what I I I Would basically say the same exact thing a ... at this point that that's important to find some of the journal on the same wavelength with as well as you can't force friends you know you really don't know if you don't have that chemistry exactly I\n\nMean\nI think everything old no\n[laughter] no [laughter]\nNo [laughter] Korean War Raman from TV
