I think common sense tells you the Saudis would have produced who did it how they did it [noise] I think we're seeing the worst and we'll see\nHow they are pretty straightforward Marco Rubio kind of laying it\nSo uh where's Waldo\nOr a\nBrand formerly known as a jumble cause soggy alright so as the situation plays out I laid the groundwork by saying\nProbably the greatest accomplishment of all of the Trump Administration is actually the one we think about the least day to day because we're not dealing with the problems you every day we see the benefit of the economy we got in front of us\nBut we can't forget that yeah you know what we didn't used to have all those domestic radicalized terrorists all the time we haven't had this problem supplied\nBy the way I'm not superstitious I'm not trying to jinx anybody here but guess what that doesn't mean that they don't happen around the world at referenced ... we got some problems here there was a real education that I undertook after we went into Iraq\nSo I uh I went along with the narrative that hey you know uh yeah I mean Afghanistan to target the outcome of bin Laden but hey we we know that ah\nWe know that we've got problems there Saddam Hussein bad dude if he goes down I mean yeah that that that makes sense in the people that could be afraid they're gonna want to be free not understanding all the complications\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to and we're kind of led to believe that they would I decided I was going to go straight to the source and read the corrupt\nStarts out by the way and they'll give you the Reader's Digest if you're not familiar starts out like sunshine law\nBob's in by the end it's kinda like hey if\nYou don't see the world the way we do a you die and by\nWhatever means necessary the groundwork ultimately the groundwork ... now you have\nIs our practice obviously many different sects some of which are ...\n... not ... in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way if you want to argue that Sheree laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to demand that if a woman is raped for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the rapists\nDangerous detail to do that if you're homosexual that's why I always liked about the ... come out don't understand ... ... ...\nIf you are a homosexual against what he gets down because you are homosexual or a you know these days they they they just got a ways sometimes they don't get the whole formal stoning thing together they they just all show buildings or whatever to support the problem\nIn us means somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attacks you think of happened that have been documented around the world so far in twenty eight team\nSay about it for a second got number ... try one thousand five hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than what you thought to get today for example in Mali you had a terror attack a woman writing\nHer donkey blown up by\nIslamic terrorists earlier today in Afghanistan you at ...\nWriting her donkey blown up\nIslamic terrorists earlier today in Afghanistan U.S forces citizens that were bombed by Taliban\nYou probably didn't even know that yesterday in France you had a man attack somebody with a chisel raising all probably didn't know about that\nSee even sometimes in countries like France it doesn't get recorded every year [noise]\nThere's a lot more to that story\nShort he is at the root of it I guess one\nStill tenets of that in Saudi Arabia\nOr the situation becomes that much more complicated\nBecause of the conversation was just getting going on my mother in law was a\nThat\nListen to what David as from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nAnd ah [noise] I was calling them you know I think that these people or the Democrats are ... are trying to do here is basically turn this country to Mexico or or even print in swat I'm someone who I Am here in the United states under the ACA program [noise]\nAnd I think I think it really sucks you know that there is that these people have the nerve to actually put themselves make themselves look like oh we're wondering when are you guys just to try to get from ... from anybody and anybody who actually cares [noise]\nHow long have you on a ... ... how long have you been here ...\nI have been here since I was ah about eight years old\nOkay and how old you are now or ...\nRight now I'm thirty three\nOkay so your view of the United states as a child and an adolescent to to today what what's changed in and what's your perspective\nYou know what I'm like in any any like any race there are good people there are bad people I've had good experiences and really bad ones too but overall work what people will have in this country if you're like oh let me let me just say this\nBut the privileges the everything that people have in this country a lot a lot a lot of the most if not everybody in the Democratic party picks up for grabs her you know\nI ... to me it's frustrating because\nWhat I what I remember when it first all trouble going for president all everybody all the celebrities saying oh we're going to leave this country is fighting never knew they always say and\nThey never do it soon is how\nI Would love to take my recovery has power ... or ... or what's his name ... [noise] if you if you saw on unhappy [noise] I'd like to try to spark\nWell Colin Kaepernick is wait making way too much money being a the the role the victim who who sacrifice everything making what about asked me to a hundred million dollars oh just a little bit more they would have made as a backup quarterback in the NFL so yeah I mean he he fully has a capitalized on his victims status\nAnd Isaac I appreciate the call and the\nPerspective you know it's interesting I'm Aaron ... filling in for more close in by the way and in in South Florida\nHispanic means about thirty different things\nAnd people always over simplify it is part of the reason why the way you have a lot of folks that get Florida elections wrong because you'll have some of these are pollsters oriental is out there who will say you know hey nationally Hispanics break X percent for Democrats and they see that hey we have a very large\nHispanic contingent in Florida\nAnd then you go all those people are going to pray for Democrats have this present\nWell hold on hold on\nFor just a minute [laughter] you have to figure out all the different interest in all the various different groups that are here all the Caribbean islands that are represented Mexico yes you do have\nSouth and Central America this also represented one of the things that I found to be most interesting kind of like a Isaac was indicating there you're on DACA\nFor many on the right there are stereotypes and assumptions for example if someone's here on DACA you'd they probably are and Obama type a Democrat is they don't like Donald Trump ... well\nNo not necessarily a big misconception that white kind of like hey you know X number of Hispanics will break this way regardless of where they're from or what their interests are you've got to get to know the people\nAnd I've found far more often than not\nPeople who really sought out the United states true immigrants\nBoy and I found more and more often than not\nThat people who really sought out the United states true immigrants they'll wanted a better life overwhelmingly overwhelmingly are more conservative than not certainly socially more conservative than the Democrats have been in a very long time\nBut even in terms of economics I mentioned earlier this hour\nYou have a lot of the younger folks have millennials for example are starting to have their eyes open to why this economy can do what the United States economy is capable of\nThey didn't know before because they became adults during the recession and then the Obama economy so now they're just starting to go wow you know things can be different\nI've seen it even around radio with some folks that have been here over the years like wow you know I really can't get better yeah get you can same deal with a lot of Hispanics\nA lot of different backgrounds\nA lot of folks that want a better life if they can obtain that they're going to want more of that and so what we've actually been seen increasingly ... is a trend towards the\nTwo of the most watched districts in the country did a a BBC special on the midterm elections they wanted to highlight six different regions of the country and the ... elections\nAs the case may be in South Florida here we have the two most heavily democratic districts currently represented by Republicans and the United States House their districts twenty six and twenty seven Florida\nAnd district twenty six you had Hillary Clinton win in that district in twenty sixteen my sixteen points\nBut you had Carlos Curbelo the curtain representative it was a Republican win by five or six points\nYou know how does that happen\nThat wouldn't happen in other parts of the country right\nI mean the the there are too many people will just both the ticket if you're voting for Hillary Clinton how could you vote for any Republican\nCongressionally again when I was just mentioning\nNot as a conventional as the not so ... a conventional wisdom or or why use thought ... would have you think there's a lot more to the story when you start talking about Hispanics and immigrants they'll want a better life\nAnd disparate twenty seven you have Hillary Clinton had been one that district by twenty points when he points\nAnd you had media retiring early in the ... when that district by\nTen\n... that's the difference here and that's why it's important\nTo break the odds with these stereotypes to really understand some of the dynamics many folks do not support the left in what they've been doing from the immigration today or in in many folks that are here on ... got a disproportionate number one in South Florida I've talked to a lot of them over the years\nThey might surprise you politically so anyway you just a little food for thought as we're three weeks away from election day let's go to Ryan who wants to take me to task Ryan in San Francisco go\nTo a a you you mentioned that you know people who smoke\nPot or all of them do whatever it or not or are not educated or\nNot is why you lose you kind of\nCame across that I made a stereotype about a yes but you're you're here to tell me that's not the case you and your ball on are are are on the right to do with it\nI I work my ass off I actually got a good um\nYou know I got my crime is back for a minute [laughter] [laughter]\nThere you are the land and Nancy ...\n... exactly right and I'm going to read up and down ticket amen brother\nI'm actually going to look into all night city council people now and me and asked them because I only got Twenty one days left so go or\nGod Bless

right wing guy in there and do that because the point I feel that I have a better chance of converting them over to my value booming we hear everything we can go against everything my deathbed\nSeeking their favorite who were coming from the ... party and what they him he only had no family mean\nTo them why they may have ... the next thing you know I mean come on and my eyes the as my idea is that I Believe that\nWell then you are you raise a number of interesting points and it sounds like you have been very much politically involved in the bowl leaned over a long window of time\nThat you're not a typical for all a lot of likely Trump voters and even the ... is typical because I'm not sure if the delineation between conservatives versus Republicans versus moderate it's really hard anymore with labels\nAbove what I Will say and I say there's a lot with especially younger Republican ask voters\nWe're basically describing is that you are a social liberal but fiscally conservative and ultimately it's how do you want your government to be run and\nThe grand scheme of things if we're talking about the values that you just represented as Donald Trump likely to strip the any of those potential rights\n... from any of the the aforementioned now is Donald Trump going to be the guy to to try to to push for the elimination of of gay marriage you know he's not\nOr for that matter he's even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement you know there he's not the most conservative guy I mean take a look at his own personal life it tells us much so you do have a fiscal conservatism gave me an idea you know I'm I'm a little bit of a quandary\nPolitically myself I you know don't generally talk about it quite this way but\nI personally am quite conservative and when it comes to social values I live my life as kind of like a half as Catholic and I said I was a good Catholic wouldn't be true so I Want to be honest so they're going to have as Catholic but I you know I Am here to that that kind of value system for so for example you know personally I'm pro life\nBut I Believe in a libertarian form of government so when it comes to social issues I Am more inclined to get the government the way for example I don't think the government should be involved at all in marriage why is it that the government dictates marriage why is it that the tax code has ever delineated\nBased upon one marital status we've created so many issues so many issues that way\nThey didn't have to be created because we put government into the mix\nSo I Am inclined or you know it's like with marijuana a lot of people think that uh you know because I I Will rail against it like we have ... you know medical marijuana legalized in Florida which a lot of states do and you had the recreational use and several more said I'll rail against it and and people are just anti marijuana what no one not\nBut I don't care about your crap as long as you keep it away from me and don't hurt anybody my issue is that it's not legal you know I I Believe again and the premise and so in the case of something like marijuana well\nNeeds to be either legalize rather minimum decriminalized by the federal government otherwise all we're doing and all these states\nLike mine is I mean our nose of the United States Constitution it doesn't work that way and that's the reason that we got all this kind of horse crap stuff going on where you can use the financial system and it creates a whole host of problems under that and you have doctors that will go\nYou know given like a wink and a not because you can't actually issue a prescription because by the way you're trying to issue guidance on a schedule one drug\nSo again that is I I think where you're coming from\nMore of a position that is prevalent within a Trump supporter but even maybe even a young younger\nA is a Republican ask again voters for the lack of a better label and certainly I think people who are constitutional is so anyway ah my my heart goes out to you for having been a victim best to you and your family or and may God Bless\nThem by the way for a high camp in North Dakota I mean come on\nYou or the high camp in North Dakota ... you're talking about the state that Trump won by thirty six points and her she's voted with Donald Trump approximately forty percent of the time I mean it doesn't exactly line up with the north Dakota and values\nI mean I I don't know what Taylor Swift per se but just like ... mud and for the great one month\nVisitors news talk ... ... ... um\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead for the [noise]\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right

up\nAnd down employment rates are down and you say we want people to make more money I couldn't agree more as one of the reasons I ran for the middle class we can increase their wages now you'd probably want to do that through government dependency I Want to do it through the miracle of the free market and guess what\nThe pay raises in late last quarter April May June we're the largest in ten years and in fact the end you'll pay raises an Iowa or five point one percent so you're entitled to your own opinion but you're not into your own facts and the facts do not support your attack it\nWhen I'm In a remote and elsewhere if on well let me ask the robot will question and I think you can probably of complicit in thirty seconds you've used the phrase working families a couple of times tonight defined what that is you also mentioned corporations paying their fair share to find that so we have some parameters please\nYes so first of all let me be very clear your eyes when he's talking about\nFolks getting ... there was just pull out the other day which supports what I'm hearing out there in the district where folks are working their tails off right now and they're not seeing an increase in their take home pay folks making Ninety thousand dollars a year or less\nAre not seeing an increase in their take home pay and that happening all across our country right now and you've got folks who are you know working forty hours a week I work in their tails off sometimes multifamily homes not able to make it\nAnd let me ask you congressman representative Finkenauer in her remarks talked about the tax bill is talked about percentages address that uh is that the way things first of all do you agree with the numbers and second is that the way things should be of course\nPercentage of tax relief did go to the middle class if you look at percentages here's another factor that is not as your other factors that didn't interrupt an inner ear up you got me finish please\nLook at percentages here's another fact and I and other factors that didn't interrupt an inner ear up you know let me finish please\nBottom fifty percent in this country play pay three percent of the federal income tax bottom fifty percent of wage earners so it's hard unless you want to take people off of the income tax rolls completely to give tax relief or to the bottom fifty percent when they're only paying three percent of the total federal income taxes\nUh when we talk about workers an increase wages their wages are going up the largest increases in ten years that's effect from the nonpartisan congressional budget office in from the department of labor that's a fact in fact they are going up faster and Iowa than the rest of the country to go on a five point one percent\nRight Nick thanks very much a congressman blown economic growth has accelerated during the Trump Administration but the fed is now raising rates in order to try and stave off inflation what steps to Congress need to take in the coming year to prevent an economic slowdown\nWhile I Am concerned as a president is about the Federal Reserve\nOr increasing the interest rates to quickly uh part one of their jobs is to make sure that the value of our currencies not devalued which means we need to try to keep inflation under control I've seen very few reports of inflationary pressure\nLook there is no doubt right now is that right that ... or is that this administration took working families took folks are farmers here and use them as poker chips that they were willing to that and lose on a trade war there's no question that China's a bad actor\nBut there has been no strategy and I do think it's something that we have to get together talk to our corn growers talk to our soybean farmers and make sure that they know that we have their backs here\nUh you know right now you got Brazil and China and making new contract with those soybeans and these are contracts that us farmers have made for a decade and I've worked for for decades and they're seeing going to go away I mean this is again now how this is supposed to work and we deserve better\nSo much for this round we are going to be speaking about health care and related issues which include Medicare and Social Security so the question the representative think an hour in Ninety seconds if you were to address and I'm going to focus on the Affordable CARE Act\nOr if as a member of Congress what would you take to modify amend change what is currently on books\nYeah thank you looked at that is something we've got effects I I was out there within the first couple of months of my campaign and I met a woman who had oxygen\nAnd she came up to me and she said that ah if that bill that Congress and blonde voted for eight CIA what'd you think has become law passed the Senate be somebody signed by the president said her doctor told her that she wasn't going to be able to afford her oxygen all twenty four hours and she was going to have\nTo pick whether she reads at night or during the day and she looked at me and said you don't pick when you've read why should I have to\nI went well we've got to do something here we've got to stop playing politics with health care and get serious about fixing that's in our country\nAnd so what we've got to do is add a public option to the APA\nOr something that quite frankly should've been done to begin with when cracking the CIA sleds loudly self up to the age of sixty five to buy into that I care essentially\nLowering those premiums adding competition into the marketplace you can keep your own insurance and drive down those premiums and you know we've got folks Democrats or Republicans no party doesn't matter where you live in this country right now\nYou're struggling with your healthcare coverage and we've got to get serious stop playing politics and what we don't do it vote for a bill that's going through a player repeal something not replace it with anything and at the same time allow insurance companies that charge more ah for folks who praises the conditions and older Americans that's not how this again is supposed to work\nAnd uh we we we've got to fix it and get serious here\nCongressman sixty seconds with regard to the current law and what if you were returned to Washington you would advocate doing with regard to Affordable Care act or replacement\nW attacking me with more what's more Kim lines from your uh ads on TV attacking me is not policy I haven't heard policy yet saying there shouldn't be political Boston this is political Washington DC is very political very political\nI haven't heard policy yet saying there shouldn't be political bulletin this is political Washington D. C. is very political\nVery political so I haven't heard policies from you I'll I'll gladly you'll my time to listen to your health actual policy now but what we need to do the supposed to keep it simple at the sixty thousand foot level Jeff we need to help people who need help financially government is good at taxing and sending out checks and let's do that\nPeople on Social Security Medicare are veterans particularly our special needs\nFolks out there and our veterans we made promises to people and we need to keep him and we need to help them on the other end of the equation when it comes to health care less unleash the miracle of the private sector of the free market this is an over regulated market place and the key here isn't cost shifting the kids to bring down the cost of health care\nAnd you don't do that by having your neighbor pay your health insurance we need to actually decrease the cost of health care through the private market\nIn thirty seconds representative Finkenauer let's talk specifically about how we keep Medicare Social security solvent going forward\nYet how well we don't do it again and say we're we care about Medicare and Social Security and at one point nine traveling to the death of that in fact today you just heard Mitch McConnell said that he's worried about the deficit so they're gonna have to look at entitlements and let the let the very clear that by entitlements he needs Social Security and Medicare\nWhich are a prominent we made to each other and at the problem is that we better be able to keep and so we've got to get serious here as well what we should do\nIs taxes Social Security income over a million dollars and at the same time when we are when we're talking about Medicare we shouldn't be allowing drug companies to negotiate directly with Medicare lower those drive that\nCongressman thirty seconds specifically on Medicare and Social Security\nThere you go again this is not going to cost the federal government a sense but I guess if you repeat a lie often enough some people will believe that\nWe need to have a bipartisan solution when it comes to Medicare and Social Security Medicare is going to go book an eight years\nSocial Security is going to go broke at sixteen years so it needs to be a bipartisan solution I've always said Republicans don't have a corner on great ideas and neither do Democrats a couple of the Democratic ideas that to help protect these two programs that I like is lifting the cap on the income that you pay into Social Security and also perhaps a means test Social Security we should look at those ideas\nAs well as some of our ideas that were in a kind of delve into the the health care a little bit more here and then we're going to take a quick break I'm\nOn the issue of opiates congressman there's been some legislative efforts on this growing problem but the epidemic has taken more live every day both here in Iowa and across the country how can Congress not only tackle this issue from a legislative standpoint\nBut hold those responsible for this accountable\nYes we have a when you say some legislative a action has been taken we passed over sixty six old bills in the house of this year when the session or to do with opioids\nAre everyone I think now in the medical community recognizes how powerful these drugs are and they also recognize that people can be addicted to them in as little\nAs five days I've even heard sometimes three days so we need to look at I I spent six hours in them with emergency room physicians that Alan hospital in Waterloo when you and it is very evident when I was in there with them we need to look at\nMaking sure we don't over prescribe opioids to people who have pain\nBecause a lot of some folks came in that six hours as emergency room and wanted\nYou could they want and pain pills and they weren't in pain so they were shopping or emergency rooms for opioids secondly or we need to do a good job of a better job of prescribing things that are not addictive to control pain nobody wants their patients in pain but we all understand that we'd all agree with that so there are alternative methods\nTo deal with pain that are that are not so addicting as an opioid does so we need to look at that but we passed over sixty a built in the house this year to help fund decimation of dissemination of information you know amongst the healthcare community and also to research and help you have access to those types of things that are not as addicting as ...\nAnd represent affected our same question what what does Congress need to do moving forward to address the issue\nWell I think that there is one of these issues where I really believe that Democrats and Republicans can get together on and get something done and we saw that on the state house level or there's always more to do I know Congress\nHas attempted to do something here and I know you know the president's through for that six million dollars toward that it needs more funding we need to actually make sure that we're supporting our local agencies as well that are you know fighting that fight on ... on the frontlines here on at the same time\nWhat we have to do as well and make sure that we released the grid that they find him I had\nOver Washington DC right now\nI'll tell ya I've never taken a dying from ... I never well\nCarson's on them I think you can say the fame and in fact conversations on actually has a investment\nAnd pharmaceutical companies you know if you're looking at getting serious about that we've got to take those influences out of that care about the people here in the district and find something that's going to work and I really believe that we're thinking of our local folks like can have that on the frontline give them what they need\nCongressman did what'd you care to respond to that do\nDo you take money from those girls that were you in this this is one of the things the swamp doesn't politics when selection near a look at a person that has a stock portfolio and start picking on the fact that you own so beyond Exxon Mobil well then you're against renewable fuels if you own a pharmaceutical company which might be a good investment well then you're in the pocket of pharmaceutical Abby\nI don't vote a certain direction no matter how much money or a company gives me never have and never will at sixty three years old I didn't go to Washington to be for sale\nAnd and I and I do agree with you though that big pharma we need to look at big pharma I'm One that supports a Democrat idea\nA which is having Medicare Medicaid negotiate\nThe prices for a pharmaceutical and also the importation of drugs across country lines\nThank you very much alright well with that we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back with more of the final first congressional district debate in just sixty seconds so don't go away\n[noise]\nElection in the race for governor of Iowa the Republican Kim Reynolds is facing democratic businessman Fred Hubble Reynolds is trying for her first full term as governor she took the job after former Governor Terry Branstad was named ambassador to China\nDuring their debate put on by the Des Moines register Reynolds says she's running on her record of job training and low unemployment I\nAnd we're just getting started\nThey figured out hiring\nZip recruiter did the work for me they're powerful matching technology game thousands of resume to find people with the right skill education and the Syrian there my job and actively invited them to a bar\nSo high got qualified candidates fast march [noise]\nThe way the recruiters rated number one by employers in the U.S for eight different could are now for free and sleep recruiter dot com slash free\nThat the recruiter dot com slash free once again zip recruiter dot com slash free zip recruiter [noise]\nThe smartest way to hire based on trust pilot rating of hiring side to that but when I was a review\nUsed to be forty K.

four thirty five today it's a Waterloo\nBlackhawks Wednesday segment on old PR job green the vice president of Waterloo Black Hawk hockey will join us live in Studio to talk about this year's Waterloo Blackhawks team there ought to wait too old and the restart\nHow 'bout that uh two wins\nNo losses and then three either over time uh last time I saw a two or three record or in their first by a games first by the matches the uh there there were home tomorrow night to in a\nAs we do every year or the processes about putting together a ...\nAs we do every year or the processes about putting together a championship level team and this years this year is processed is is no different two and a half weeks what a what has happened and and what have we learned so far a couple of things individually are\nNot white little house is in tremendous shape he's healthy and you know he had spent the better part of the last two years where he's been banged up with with a couple of different injuries and he is healthy right now um 'cause I mentioned he is in great shape he is practiced very well\nUh one of the areas where he has taken some steps forward is in terms of his communication and as our most experienced player\nHis voice is is a very important to who we are now it's very important to what we do on the practice for it will be very important to how we develop our team as his why it's a continued communication and his leadership [noise]\nHi Jay green a tribe or all be Goldman three of our new guys I tell you age age a green has got a tremendous work ethic competitiveness is discipline his determination uh those things are all at a\nAn extremely high level than a and he is a terrific lawyer\nBut I what I've I'm for it I found out and obviously known him for a long long time but what I found out being around them every day is he has earned every bit of that the success he's had in high school the level of player that he is right now\nHe has earned every single bit of that and it uh it's been fun to be around that had a positive impact on on his teammates already I'm just love is competitiveness\nUh train biggie are both great fits for what we're doing for what we want to do I think as we all know that the college game has changed the game of basketball has changed uh you know the the versatile undersized guys that are playing small for power forward center those positions um as\nAs made for a very different game and a biggie and and Trey fit into that for us and uh so both those guys have been a bit of port and I'm trying to get a lot of versatility now he's got he's got good size a\nBiggie is almost six ten very skilled uh and both of those guys I'm I'm as I mentioned going to be I'm going to be important to what we do and I\nYou know the the thing about all three of those guys that got us excited is is they're playing out a fairly high level they don't know a lot right now but they're playing at a fairly high level but\nThere'll be like in two weeks what there'll be like and for weeks I'll walk there'll be like six weeks from now I'm just feel like all three of those guys are going to get better and better the early on in their careers ... you know guys at a point for quite a bit a ready to increase their roles are ready to take on more responsibility\nSpencer has been important in terms of scoring the basketball forest but\nThat he's got he's got a little bit of an edge to one and uh for the group that we've got right now a Spencer letting that be part of what he's doing it every day I'm allowing that to have an impact on our team and also his personality and the ads that he plays with a um [noise] he'll filters through our team and now we've got a team that can reflect some of that\nSpencer has gotten to the point now has a red shirt junior now that's something that we're going to need out of hand and\nSay and I've I've talked about quite a bit at at times in the past and\nYou know he showed a year ago his ability defensively and then in particular late in the year and and I think everybody probably remembers the performance jihad against the Evansville defensively I'm as some of the games that I've watched recently that was that was one of them and\nI'm kind of the impact that he had on that basketball game the job that he did on Ryan Taylor in that game\nOr something that has a and I've talked about a lot and uh he's looking forward to that challenge as we head into this year of being our best defensive player you know we've talked to him about\nA finding a way to be on the defensive team and our league I'm getting in contention for defensive player of the year ... those are things that he should be thinking about um we also feel like it's important that he doesn't limit his\nImprovement his development his next step if you will that he he doesn't limit it to the defense of an to the floor or he's a very talented young man and so he can\nI'm expanding his game off as of late um\nAlong his versatility to impact what we're doing as a team or so we've got a you know we've got a lot of things on his plate right now but feel like he's ready to to take those things on [noise]\nA Luke McDonnell Justin ... miles one scene I'm clicking Connery all four of those guys are to return or is if they have gotten better um all four of 'em are playing as well as they have played in their time here\nA little ... as a as a skilled inside guy force and we've seen some of the past couple of years I Know he's excited to to earn some more time to be a bigger part of the rotation and um he is playing right now as well he is as he has played in his time with us adjusting to all\nYou know it just brings a different a different field thinks he's got he's got a a size that you don't see very often at seven foot and and two hundred and fifty five pounds is here's a guy that simply\nUm with that size able to make make a difference in how the game feels and um he is in the best shape that he's been in um he said his best practices here in the last four or five days and done is really made some good strides\nMiles is now I Do I think all the guys would tell you if you ask them when you go down there I think they would all tell you that he is a favorite of all there's um\nAnd he's a he's and he's he got ... and he's a guy to to root for a works extremely hard and and I'd be surprised if he doesn't find a way into into our rotation in some way shape or form and then\nAnd then Lincoln Connery as he may be they\nCould be the most improved guy from a year ago into right now his athleticism it's changed a tremendously I'm shooting the ball very well uh just putting a lot of time a lot of work he's worked hard on his body and they're really proud of Lincoln for for changes he's made a couple of team observations with a with a roster that we've got\nOur office is going to look different or\nWe will ah um the pace to play for us uh we'll look different will be different this roster is better built to do that or make some of the changes that I briefly referred to in terms of the the game I think we've all seen it [noise] um\nWhere you've got a lot of times you've got four guards on the floor and and and you've got a center on the floor more times than not right now that center is pretty skilled this are you able to do more things and transition able to do more things are moving the ball side to side um\nWe've got a number of guys on this roster that fit that are so offensively which practiced differently or we feel like we're going to look different at the end of the four terms increasing the increasing the pace applied\nDefensively will get a lot to learn 'em anytime you've got a number of new guys on your roster boy it uh uh there's there's a lot of things that are um that go into being a good defensive team and so there's a lot of learning going on right now at the defense of men to the floor [noise] um\n[noise] they don't as much as as much as the game is changing and we've had we've had some difference that stretches in practice where we've seen it\n[noise] and an almost gets going up and down so fast it feels a little bit like a pick up game and a and are going to pull my hair out just a little bit but but so far um ... it's the the\nYes it feels a little bit like a pick up game and and are going to pull my hair out just a little bit but but so far um\n[noise] it's the the change in the office of ed has been good um but but what we can tell you from our staff standpoint\nAt the defensive end of the floors or championships are more than just because of the game has changed a lot in the last Twenty years ten years in the last three years even though we don't feel like I'm\nThe road to a championship has changed in in terms of being a team at the defense of end of the floor that can hold down to four and a so we'll continue to hammer away at a at a defensive end of the floor\n[noise]\nOr the other uh just a couple of more things other three things we're talking to to this group a lot about and I and\nI think in large part because this roster is made up of guys a fellow term tremendously skilled than guys that are easy to like and guys that are working extremely hard um\nThere's a there's a lot of reasons for us to just have to look forward to getting to practice and being on the practice for with these guys and um but three things that we are talking to him quite a bit about is is the process and when you're\nYou know when you're young or when you're new and there's so many things that you've gotta learn sometimes that gets in the way of playing really hard and we are at the point yet where we've been able to combine the two are being able to be where we're supposed to be having a great understanding of how to do that individually and as a team and competing at the highest level that we are capable of a\nKey hope to get to that point as soon as you can\nWhen you get to that point now you then have an opportunity it as an individual to impact your teammates and impact what's going on around you\nSo the sooner you can get guys to that point the better and right now we're still with ah with quite a few guys were still in that first part of the process where a lot of things are new and it it interrupts sometimes just playing as hard as you can possibly foie gras or we're going to keep working on a part of it [noise]\nAccountability is another area that we stress a lot um [noise]\nAnd really narrow and all the way down to to to personal accountability um you know when something doesn't go quite right which is going to happen quite a bit um when you're new and when you're learning\nWhen it doesn't go quite right or working to move on to what a what the solution is in figuring out how we're going to do it better next time and are not having your first thought be\nIt was someone else's fault or am I to blame who's to blame for what happened I'm\nFrom an accountability standpoint we want our guys to you're going to make mistakes and we want him to understand that it doesn't have to be anyone's fault that we need to figure out what the solution is we need to figure it out fast we need to move on to the next play and that can be difficult when you're younger and there's so many things being thrown at you [noise]\nUh the Blackhawks starting with the the game tomorrow night at home\nHome opener was last Saturday Night and we we've talked about it before on this show talked about it even with Tim Harwood when he was in here last Wednesday doesn't matter what the sport is there's nothing quite like opening night you're home opening game for your team whatever the sport is and it was that last Saturday Night a young arena for the blackout\nIt it was a it was ... really special atmosphere\nOn opening night and you know we we build all summer long you know leading up to that it's almost like kind of a movie premier right there's a lot of build up and promotion and\nAnd you finally get there and and I thought overall our staff that a tremendous job with putting on a great show for fans and the energy and younger Reno was a you know we've had some sold out crowd network that weren't nearly as into it and as as loud and energetic as that crowd was Saturday So very pleased with\nWith our opening night went overall um and and great hockey game physical back and forth a overtime now he fell short in overtime but I mean overall couldn't really have gotten off to a better started other than in in the wind column but still picked up a crucial point\nDrop to a banner too didn't you absolutely out of the interesting banner was unveiled a pre game we had a special video highlighting last year's organization and um you know it was a again it was a very special\nUh I think a lot of people you know that's a memory they'll remember a is being being there for that and ah and then obviously you know walk to the banner gets unveiled in its next next next ... next chapter write it's time to move forward new team new roster and here we go again\nI I can just hear a head coach peek a oh handily when the banner drops looking at his coaches in his guys and saying oh All right guys is this the new year now turn the page we yeah\nA ... pizza slices and a soft drinks so really affordable opportunity for families to come out\nOr get ready for the weekend on a Thursday night we got posters schedules available for the first one thousand fans courtesy of parents ... writes them are nine or ... you know we're expecting a hopefully a good crowd and they also get a lot of kids out support the guys and again the support so far this season's been great\nFall in that you go right to sue Falls South Dakota then to Sioux City they got that Danny Sanford premier center and that is quite the theory ended up playing they claim to have some home ice advantage how's ... handling the guys getting ready to handle a rowdy crowd out in Sioux Falls\nWell it'll certainly be a large crowd you know the the Sioux Falls stampede continue um every season to put big numbers on the board when it comes to attend to send\n'em you know who it is it is a challenging place to play although I Will say we've had some pretty good success there over the past few years uh\nEyes who falls and uh and then we get right on the bus and had the Sioux City on Saturday which is a team that obviously knocked us out of the playoffs two years ago we've had some good rivalries with Sioux City over the years so you know three games in three days not as the guy in charge of building the schedule\nHome at young arena you've got you and I volleyball nine and old in the valley hosting in state rival Drake seven o'clock Friday nights in a cloud you got you and I

be at that level and that\nAnd I get to take a day I got the coach against Pat Summit that was one of her in the lake and then they went on and when the national championship or that one of those really cool moments\nBut then I decided to leave home in a solid my dream is in a college coach to Utah State university and was able to\nLearn how to plant roots somewhere else and and make\nCoaching

understand that we we haven't we haven't had to meet about that we haven't had to talk about that so AJ I'm coming out of today is probably going to get talked about a lot and going to get a lot of interviews and he's going to be in the paper and that\nShould be because he's worked really hard and he'd already earned it even though he has and play the game as I mentioned um\nBuddies to see my ... year that he wants to win and he wants to be part of a championship team and do everything that he can to help us do that as soon as possible\nSpecifically on the floor of a re a high level

your uh uh you're expected and held accountable for things that you haven't been held accountable for and sometimes a very good reason there's no reason that AJ or Taiwan or\nSome of the other

isn't doesn't get that those guys don't play hard defensively um that doesn't understand how important defense was to winning the state championship bud individually um you know being held accountable and I am the expectation of of how you have to defend at this level to to have success it's different than that takes time\nUm stuff that's the way you just you know he puts immediate pressure on the other team\nYou know when he's coming as soon as he crosses half core and he's come with that basketball there's immediate pressure on the other team and that's one of the reasons why we feel like he can have success early because of the amount of pressure you can put on the defense\nAnd then he can do it in different ways you can do it off the job or you can do it going left or right um he can run off screens um [noise] you know the catch in shoot a\nIs in between game he's worked hard at getting to the to the basket but he's got so many things about his office of game right now that are

just better young men they're going to turn out to be very successful or whatever they choose to do and to get some recognition down the line into work and that they put it really a really a special group\nIn class one aid but also in many other classes it's so important to have guys who can go both ways can you talk about the players that rely on down and down out regardless of whether it's

hold on Cape assuming those things happen and I certainly except they're true or not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by illegal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and now it's happening inside of our own country\nBecause we as far as President Trump I voted for his planet down he's trying to change the\nCourse\nOf course when the jets coach Jeff

does that mean complex it what does that mean while still but was it for the sides to kill them in that fashion almost on videotape that was stupid that was real stupid and I hope we're not stupid but even if it happened the way we think it happened\nFrankly my dear I don't give a damn compared to what's happening in this country every year\nHow many times are killed two hundred times or murdered every year in this country there's CNN go into the murder of police officers and why that's a horrible thing how come CNN when I covered the murder cops but they're covering some sun citizen in Turkey

Dodgers lose this afternoon but let's continue is more aware of let's go to Chris in Atlanta Georgia Chris in Atlanta Welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead Chris how are you\nHow are you\nGreat day to be an American please go ahead\nAmen to that so just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um [noise] I don't I Can't paraphrase what you said about the specifically about everything\nSo just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um [noise] I Can't bear phrase but you said about the specifically about it being a crisis or you'd have a problem with a meeting with Michael repair yeah\nOkay well I mean I just I mean I'm just some sort of playing devil's advocate with this issue with it too but um if if we believe that I'm I'm Catholic so I Believe everybody in the vicar of Christ justice Christ ... centers um [noise] what is your what is your what\nDo I go to Chris but the difficulty\nI don't think Michael Moore went there to get the pope on video talking to him as if he was a center wanting to be confessing to and receiving grazed from the pope I think Michael Moore went there has this huge to capture the pope\nIn a moment that he could use for his own political purposes against the Trump and\nIt Michael Moore has had some ... sources like Paul and the road to Damascus and said okay I've seen the air waves I've seen the damage that cause the police officers in American Soldiers\nI see the damages caused by three thousand innocent babies killed every day in this country and I'm going to the pope for forgiveness for what I've done I'm with you but I think Michael Moore probably went there with the pope today in order to get a photo opt to use politically against him that's what I think\nI I agree with you just feel that maybe he already knows Michael Moore is maybe a personal agenda background\nWell you know Chris a pope is given interviews in which he says he does not read newspapers is not watch TV\nAnd he came from Argentina now in Rome and we'd like to think in America we're the only country that matters but I guess if you spend your life in Argentina Brazil and Central America South America and now you live in Rome you probably don't read newspapers or watch TV\nCount how would you know Michael Morris and so I you know I guess I could work my way to the front of the line and get a picture with the pope but I Would like to think that Michael Moore is not one of those characters the pope would be familiar with and if he was I Would hope Michael Moore was able to convince to confess as many sense\nSure not solely\nI think more about people that may be given credit or by just 'cause I I they're they're a little bit about him that strikes me as on and\nYou know I like to be supportive of the pope says there's there are there are a lot of things that really struck me about him and to me it's not it's not surprising when when it says is really\nHarsh love question he he's not the last pope now he's not Benedict he's France's and he's a socialist he's left wing er and er\nAnd this whole uh precisely scandal or something that I Hope it's not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but do what he did with Medicare and what do you deal with the world didn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I I just hope there is no there there were Chris we gotta go thanks for your
