a reporter he's a buffoon nobody can seriously argue that Brian ... out there is any kind of reporter or journalist he's a buffoon and you go right down the list\n\nRight down the list nine things you need to know about illegal immigration and crime this was two years ago the daily wire Byron\n... number one federal state local governments keep data involving illegal immigration and crime out of the public purview\nFox News reported in twenty Fifteen that a source from immigration and Customs Enforcement ice and I love ice\nI've said that quote that comprehensive statistics on a legal immigrant crime are not available from the federal government that suggested contacting county state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally a process that would encompass thousands of local government so in other words\nIt's the official position of the federal government not to provide you with the crime statistics not to track\nIt they track everything except that\nNumber two available evidence suggests that illegals are in fact more likely to commit crimes and the rest of the population\nFox News sorted through myriad local state and federal statistics and found that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than the three point five percent share of the U.S population would suggest now why isn't this information\nReported today on good morning America on the today show by Shepard Smith Bible Blitzer what\n\nThe percentage of illegals committing the number of crimes are as follows according to Fox Thirteen points six percent of those sentence for all committed crimes in the country ... percent of murder sentences sixteen percent of trafficking sentences\nNumber three this is a deli wire almost fifty percent of federal crimes committed near the Mexico border\nA report from the department of justice in twenty fourteen found the following via judicial watch\nAnd it gives the specific statistics\nNumber for illegal immigrants account for nearly Seventy five percent of federal drug sentences and twenty four again this is according to the United states sentencing commission which also found that illegals were involved in nearly Seventeen percent of drug trafficking sentences and over thirty three percent of federal sentences overall\nPark how do you know these people are committing crimes while I don't know about specific individuals but these are the statistics\nI thought big government left his wife statistics\nNumber five a disproportionate amount\nOf illegals are in state prisons Peter curse and now it remember the U.S commission on civil rights lawyer review statistics from the government Accountability Office and pure Research Center\nAnd compared the number of illegals and not illegal in prison for murder related offenses any twenty Fifteen National Review piece some of the findings\nThey're almost Seventy thousand illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona\nLet me correct that there were sixty eight point five seven\nAre illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand a legal to an Arizona compared to fifty four point oh six citizens and legal non citizens\nAnd it goes on but you can imagine what the statistics\nAre\nPersonnel knowledge that while comparing murder incarceration rates as an imperfect measurement it's difficult to contend that illegal aliens or more are law abiding then legal residence at least when it comes to a major crimes\nBut the more disturbing fact was the approximately two thousand four hundred and thirty illegal aliens who are in prison Jess for homicide related offenses in California alone\n\nNumber six tens of thousands of criminal illegals have been released by ice and are at large in the country\nAnd twenty Fifteen ice released almost twenty thousand illegals that committed sixty four thousand crimes that are involved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidnappings and more than two hundred homicide or man slurry convictions\nSeventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidnappings and more than two hundred homicide or manslaughter convictions\nAnd this is why when you have a fool like the mayor of Tallahassee Gillum who says that they will not turn over\nConvicted\nIncarcerated and then three illegal aliens to be deported by ice they will not turn them over to I Do understand that part of you understand what I'm Talking about\nHe's got a radical\nWho wants to be your governor I've got more when I returned\n\nAnd not to mention the shedding I went back in the car that three times a week Freda with scratching all night long bouncing on the side of the day keeping me awake the whole entire night from scratch and and chili kind of makes you never\nBut you wouldn't know that because when the president raises it\nAnd he's done a lot of work on this says you're them as Thirteen so it was attorney general Jeff Sessions ... the U.S attorneys all across the country when you raise it they blow it off well everyone is not MSN I watched the Baghdad well it's only a small number you're everybody's not I'm not certain these insane and they in arguments\n[laughter] [noise]\nThe hearts of MS Thirteen of extended Brentwood community the Long Island New York\nAnd they've committed horrendous crimes in Virginia on Long Island and in other cities the west coast around LA\nNumber a century cities have hampered law enforcement and cracking down on gangs the great Heather McDonald documented the frustrations of Los Angeles law enforcement officers all the way back in two thousand for when they couldn't touch known gang members because of their status as well eagles we can't even\nTalk about it says are frustrated LAPD captain people are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics and other LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals\nThe issue is that these gang members\nTended to sneak back into the country even after they were deported for heinous crimes and police officers couldn't enforce immigration laws against them what I have to resort to surveilling these gang members until they committed a\nCrime number nine\nClimate was also increased among major cities that are immigration hubs\nDeli wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro's written quote David from the Atlantic\nNo hard core and immigration opponent and a kind of a code but anyway\nI wrote in twenty Fifteen that as I'm twenty eleven there were twenty five thousand illegal immigrants\nServing murder sentences and nearly three million offenses committed by illegal immigrants between two thousand three and two thousand nine including Seventy thousand sex crimes and hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes\nAfter years of welcome declined from pointed out crime rates are rising in immigration Hobbs including Houston\nMalarkey Phoenix San Diego you got that Gloria border you idiot\nAnd New York it was thirty four percent Arizona seventeenth birthday present during those years criminal aliens accounted for thirty eight percent of all murder convictions and the five states have California Texas\nArizona Florida and New York well illegal aliens constituted only five point six percent of the total population in those states\nNow there's no denying the fact is\n\nYou've got a guy running for governor Gillum in Florida but the other problem with this\nOnce a criminal illegal alien is released from prison rather than having a did painter do hold on for the feds to deport them Gillum says abolish ice and no we're not gonna work to get a dead painter now think about that Florida\n\nThing about that ladies and gentlemen this is the official position of the United states the Democratic party the Democratic party it's the official position to abolish ice age the official position that localities in states local and state law enforcement should not work with ice\nThey've smeared ice\nIce isn't even the border patrol ice protects the interior of the ...\nIs smeared ice\nIce isn't even the border patrol ice protects\nThe interior of the United states\nFrom illegal than criminal immigrants and you're supposed to hate them\nNow you know actual facts if you're watching cable TV is the news parts of cable TV so calm\nYou didn't hear any of this instead all your herd all day today and yesterday were trashing Trump\nThat's what you've heard you've heard\nReportage yell at the ... do you know for sure there are terrorists among the seven thousand what kind of a stupid question is that my response to the reporter is do you know that every one of the seven thousand haven't committed crimes that none of them are terrorists\nThe whole point is there a legal allies are not going through the vetting process well the president said they're criminals among them they're terrorists among them well I have no doubt they're\n\nCriminals know what they're doing parents know what they're doing what we have to wait for them to do something but that's not even the point they're not allowed in our country as a matter of federal law\n\nThe media do not have the same compassion for American citizens who violate federal law they don't have that same passion for American citizens\nWho may get their taxes\nWrong or maybe violate Obamacare and so forth and so on\n\nWhat's happened in this country is the Democratic party in the media have romanticized\nIllegal immigration romanticized illegal aliens that's the propaganda that's going on in this country\nThat the illegal immigrant is no blur better more hard working then the American citizen\nAnd these fools and the Democratic party and some of the Republican Party but let's be honest really the Democrat Party is a near monopoly on this little legal immigration these foods and the Democrat part at least four in the media these fools and highly\nWhat they're doing to this country is unparalleled it's unparalleled\n\nWe have a president who calls it like it is we have a president who's trying to address his hands are tied by ridiculous loss of his hands are tied by the Democrat Party the media try to beat him down even though they fail\nThe median desperately wants the Democrats the when the electric\n\nAll the free media the Democrats get incredible they desperately want the Democrats win this election they reject the results of the twenty sixteen election to the media\n\nEven heard this Gloria Bolger on CNN's at age twenty sixteen all over again [laughter]\nShut up you idiot\n\nWe know the vast majority of these people are Democrats and liberals poll after poll has shown and they can no longer conceal their ideology\n\nBut what kind of people what kind of citizens root for illegal aliens that come into your country and they don't know if there's any

very expensive because it took a long time to develop them there's an enormous amount of money that pours into them and they're not widely used in other words there for very specific types of cancer very specific types of diseases and so forth and so\nIf\nYou can show any pharmaceutical company any\n\nYour tax returns where you'd be don't maybe you don't even have tax returns or that poor they will provide you with the prescriptions for free board and enormously reduce costs but often for free\nThey have programs where they specifically do that\n\nSince you truly cannot afford met foreman

China over this thirty year period from the late seventies or into the earlier part of this decade\nFor those those who don't have that background documents for us want different what happened in the eighties and nineties that revolutionized the China economic system and its rule in the global economy\nThat's a great question and I think um if if that was the complex ... which uh\nI I tell you need to try to try to kind of make pretty straightforward\nBut um I think it's the opposite from me it's kind of best captured by a U.S saying that's attributed to a shopping when he became the leader of China are really in ... the very end of the Nineteen seventies and until his death in a in a at the beginning of the nineties in Ninety two\nAnd um he is a ...\nIt's attributed to him that he said to a one of the big Communist Party Congress is a very very early on in his political career that he said he didn't care where it was a black cat or a yellow cat so long as it was a cat but cool mice\nAnd I'm ... people kind of meant by that reveal what they think that he meant by that was that\nAlthough China was a a different sort of a country with a different kind of political system from I'm much of the rest of the world of the time other than maybe the Soviet Union as was\nThat China needed to change it needed to [noise] he wants to become prosperous one due to improved a lot of its citizens would have\nTo be flexible and pragmatic and allow market oriented functions and systems to become part of the state system if you see what that means I was a sort of a a blended version of\nA vast socialist system with aspects of the capitalist system as well so I'm really I Would say that everything that happened do a lot of things that happened in the eighties\nUh with regards to agricultural reform and to the concept of ownership um ... things have happened in the Nineteen nineties as state enterprises were a flash back in size and scope loves companies were privatized\nUm what happened in the two thousands when China joined the world Trade Organization I'm happy to make\nEnormous changes in the way that they organized and structure that it's business environment or these things I think really lay behind the eruption of China to what has become today\nI wanted you to lay that allowed for us as you have to help us understand the cross roads in this\nBecome and today and I wanted you to lay then allow for us as you have to help us understand\nLook cross roads in essence that you believe China is that now and in the book red flags which is just coming out later this month you are identifying things that could derail\nThe success of the Chinese economy identify more or less what the trouble spots are the red flags obviously as you see it and what that would mean for those of us in this country and for the global community\nYeah I'm sure I Am so just by way of background but I think it's important to remember that a lot of China what changes have kind of become a little bit kind of worried outlaw skeptical about the sustainability if the Chinese model\nBut it's not just toss 'em so China's last premier are effectively staff or equivalent to the prime minister\nWen Jiabao I'm basically had a set in two thousand seven in two thousand eleven that we call them they have become unsustainable and cold and they feed on balanced\nAnd even last year when presidents seizing paying was de ... most of the major um Congress the nineteenth Congress over the Communist Party he described the economy is being inadequate to meet the needs of the people for a better quality of life\nOr added that needed to be changed so it's something which I think China's leaders recognize that ah that changes require the question is\nCan they do it and will they do it needs to change that this was the subject of the of the book and I kind of identified four major domestic or why coven traps\nWonder if the debt trapped which has stayed about the speed with which China has built up an unstable level of debt and um and on the instability in the financial system from stock debt not dissimilar to what happened to us in the two thousand and fleeting up to our financial crisis\nOr the written ... trap is about the currency which is under pressure\nNow and go will be will remain so a while and the debt problem is being worked out of the demographic trap is about\nChina being the ... aging country on the planet the oldest which is Japan\nUh but the first is aging country and they they claim to age that the pace of aging in China is going to happen so quickly it's had about twenty to twenty ... they will achieve a kind of an age structure which it took 'em sit in the west about eighty years to accomplish\nAnd then finally they the middle income trap is really about what it takes to grow out of\nUm a country in China's state which is a middle income country with income the head of about eleven thousand twelve thousand dollars I'm ... how do you get rich and that's really about the quality of your institutions\nAnd about ... regulations and about competitive strategies and about um a productivity basically and um so what I'm kind of clearing rarely is whether China has the the political than the government system to be able to do that\nHow successfully across a lost I should say that the the issues that we read about nowadays almost every day which has to do with the trade war between China and the United states\nAnd the er which is actually much wider than just to kind of us and China because in investment relations in technology I'm trying to run the west generally have a big issues which I think a plump it very very deep roots\nAnd these are going to aggravate ah the the existing challenges which I think a fishing brings China faces\nAnd I wanted to go down that road with you and I and I'm Glad you you mentioned what you just did because I'm curious as to whether or not the current administration ease ease are exacerbating the situation with China that you've identified\n... CDs altering the staff that China may tank\nOr are they just simply a a big enough player in the global situation than this is a minor skirmishes you will over on this side with the U.S and regardless of what the Trump Administration does he will not significantly alter the past that China is on as you identify it\nAre my view is that I think it's all great significance really um although it's very difficult for anybody to predict\n'em exactly even more ways that will be significant but let me just kind of summer eyes a little bit but it's just not um although steps would be the physical about trade it's not really about the kind of trade disputes that let's say the United states had with Japan in the Nineteen eighties\nUm or with other countries before and after that they say it's really a ... it's a stent somebody about trade but it's fundamentally about um technology the ... tree implications of that technology and about um you know an adversarial relationship about\nAh who's the kind of taught do clearly I think fundamentally about what was his mouth\nAnd um [noise] the the the the reason that it's significant perfect gift because um even though there are people who would say that Congress may not be the right way to go about\nUm uh trying to change China's policies in terms of industry and technology and so on and that we would be better off maybe engaging in a different sort of way and it is going to change the way that China thinks about\nUh itself so I think for example that I'm older charters making great strides in becoming I'm a big technology palate has its own technology giants like em Ali Baba by two and ten percent\nUm or that they are making big progress they are doing a lot of investing in hot official intelligence reports aches and they still depend a lot on foreign companies I'm On the foreign technology and so what this dispute is doing is giving them cause to reflect\nWorking families can't afford that Iran\nFred how he'll take I only in the wrong direction [noise] I'm Kim Reynolds and I approve this message paid for by the camera for Iowa\nChaotic scene alive and local continues now I'm Tim Harwood\nHalloween is just over a week away it's time now for a science of parenting update with Jim Weber humans sciences specialist expert in nutrition and wellness at the Iowa State extension service Jill our guest thanks for being with us\nI'm happy to be with you thank you\nWell one of the ubiquitous things about Halloween is of course candy treats right there in in the scene trick or treating right and that's when everyone looks for is the traits that come with Halloween and uh before we get started on air\nYou suggested that the treats aren't necessarily a bad thing even when it comes to your area of expertise in nutrition and wellness\nWell when we think about Halloween it's really one day and we say that all things can be enjoyed in moderation but I think we all would agree that Halloween has become more of a season with the candy hitting the stores really early as\nParents not being able to resist it so we certainly many people have candy around for a lot more than one day I'm so that makes it a challenge for up here it\nOn so if you think about the true uh idea of Halloween there's nothing wrong with them enjoying it up for one night and but one of the healthy things we can do is to spend that time teaching our kids moderation and so I'm not focusing just on\nA the the food candy part of the holiday that there can be parties and decorations costumes and games that children can play as well\nWhen it comes to food on Halloween I I'm not suggesting that people are probably going to start giving away healthy snacks all of a sudden or that that's going to be all that popular with the trick or treaters after doors\nBut there are some things that parents can do to make sure that kids are eating healthy on Halloween at least before the candy starts to fall into those a trick or treating banks and buckets\nAbsolutely so having it healthy family meal or snack before you go out trick or treating would be a good thing to do and then to think about the container that you're taking when you go trick or treating\nI don't take a a pillow case but you know just a nice small\nUm pumpkin or or something like that that they can carry and don't focus on um the mount a and then after Halloween spending some time talking to the children about a ... you know one tree at day\nI'm after Halloween let them enjoy the the night and and he what they want for that first night but then you know teaching a moderation one treat a day and a lot of times there will be um dentists or other places that um will have a buyback program or whether you can donate a the candy\nSo that would be another idea or the children could trade that meant to you for um another toy or something or to get rid of that there's a lot of extra that you don't want to deal with after the ... Halloween day\nWe're talking with Joe Weber during the science of parenting update and one thought that I had seen a discussed\nThat seemed really intriguing was the idea that you're out walking around through your neighborhood on Halloween during trick or treating season and maybe that's an opportunity even though we will have some cooler weather headed our way to make that part of a regular routine with the kids\nGoing to ride on a walk at the family is a great idea so spending time being active and and together is a a wonderful family activity that involves a physical activity for for everyone so what a wonderful idea\nAnd when you have that pile of candy there at home whether that's from the trick or treating hall or whether that's the leftover that may have been a still in the bowl from your own trick or treating handouts or you don't have to necessarily work through it all that quickly will of course freeze\nAbsolutely so getting it out of sight can be a good thing to do and I just enjoying one key today is a good way to teach moderation for everyone in the family\nDeal any last thoughts you'd like to leave us with here during this pre Halloween science of parenting update\nI Would encourage people to do to the Iowa State university extension science of parenting a website and sign up for our blog and look for additional resources there\nJill thanks so much happy Halloween and we'll talk with you again at some point down the road\nThank you very much happy Halloween to you as well\nJill Weber humans sciences specialist focusing on nutrition and wellness at the Iowa State extension I'm Tim hardwood on the voice of eastern Iowa news talk Fifteen forty ...\n[noise]\n... heart and mix that's who we\nIn forty ...
