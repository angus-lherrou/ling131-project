much that's Natasha ... genes in Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tank and assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor time uh comments made by a Natasha regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace of which they move\nWhile you can even think of hurricane sort of like elite and extreme and that is a you know the leaf is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a sudden it or not moving very quickly what like for instance sorted linger over the place and that given the period of time whereas a leaf enough that hoping stream like um\nLike Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUm uh it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um a window or ah area for a longer period of time and that has capability and pack likelihood of producing flooding rainfall\nUm but in terms of the wind you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving boat slow in the past\nI say so in other words the the speed at which this storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nYou know no it isn't\nVery good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remedy Sarah continue to move across a Georgia having a course of the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Brian ... tang\nUh this uh departments in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they lived at all these terms like a old lace we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ...\nAnd early know what that is but it it sounds like you folks are are totally on touch a\nWith a with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time I we used to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess you know only watch today we act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we'd go under case for that and it it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain too to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether interdict extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany that focuses on tropical psych loan formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system look start with ...\n... what is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and land tick 'em we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form a in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction of them will form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWind that time of year I Know there is a season but I'd never wipe\nOut the window water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that also when the atmosphere is is on a ... the the more most moist um and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north [laughter]\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to farm for hurricanes to far\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of what the\nOf the world at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of what this thing could do and I asked him and so is there anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers at camp ... said yeah we can get a handle on the all the factors in the environment if you got all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure and low pressure areas\nIf it you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but bad it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle\nThe the the amount of data that's out there\nAre yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day uh our satellites and in space or take many many measurements over the entire globe and that all nice to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast a lot on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get a more powerful and um we we sort of learn about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked at the tropical cycle formation of this by the way those will be three credit hours at the end of the [noise] uh but now the then the other part of the research intensification okay so the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight and and Tennessee changes is one of the grand challenges of ... predicts and that's something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly song like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong\nA tropical site found or hurricane um so what sort of ... we we generally understand kind of what feels ... that is as you as you said for kind of the warmer ocean waters that a light below the CIA flow a blow to hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of a the fuel gasoline for us to power to Windsor to store\nAll right and then that takes us do interactions with the the the climate system itself uh are there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm to do a hurricanes ah portions of the planet where a a all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\nIf the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of a number of hurricanes that formed the Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons but neither do the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing to think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess what what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in western for against life when I was just sort of generic sites on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nHairdresser yeah those are just terms of convenience we're centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes ... which is why I and the science community we just referred to everything as a tropical ... phone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nWherever the all I Will continue our discussion divided your calls welcome of course uh either as a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather ah and also in the experience as you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael

never been worse uh I think a lot of these other storms hit and getting a wrong in comparison to Camille\nI mean that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf uh there were\nTankers there were African freighters bar just on the highway Ninety and updated arrested in that area\nAnd get a didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or shellfish or anything I was wondering if you can comment on the fact that given no reference kissed far as the area of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nYou're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot a lot of people these days I don't remember a storm because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast or\nOr was absolutely tremendous um [noise] what's what's different today grasses that oh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more ... a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because a building on the coast of the very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's a choice to do that you know\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that conversation I went through the entire thing and I went to all of it so I mean I'm well I got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised ... oh I'm going to lose my electricity\nAnd I'm going to get some water in my house that came with a little not to ...\nOr ... yeah you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area\nI'm a tend to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they can take their windows and um by some buy a bag of chips and just through the event and that will be yet but\nI'm the the there is always we always stress you know before hurricane season begins you

storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago or from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now sixty mile an hour sustained winds and heading toward south\nCarolina yeah will ah ah here from Tom uh his take on on uh the\n... that this historic storm as it came ashore but also what to expect in the coming days uh as uh the people of Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of tropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nComing up and say about uh apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb for election day ... and detonated in Washington is looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device it was like two hundred pounds\nYou know uh you you go back a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul\nA talking about where the left is going and of course after his attack he knows all too well\nUh what people will do when they're politically motivated\nBut talks about the greater potential love and and he said is concerned that there will be on the SAT there might be an assassination or in another attempted assassination or we go back to the um uh the the the ball field is shooting\nOf Steve's beliefs\nAnd how that was ... as we pointed out yesterday a multiple assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast ... by video roadblock\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so\nA strength in terms of uh the when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yay yay [laughter] tomorrow so [laughter] yeah\nWell on to our friends in Europe or you know um you can have we hope you does that does that does that I'm On the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes no guy yeah wow yeah I did\nI just assume at the time we got ... probably be cool down so I'm surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up yeah\nAnd all and and and that's why we're having these storms and the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that\nExtent this is the fourth major hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so\nYeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with an October [noise] when you consider that there's been four of them total\nAnd and so and then the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said well is it gonna kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no\nI'd better get out and you were right because I I'd asked that question which brings me to another question that is just to just personal interest to me and and that is when you get it from ... you know turn or tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right\nYes All right\nSo do does that mean that a hurricane like this does it then does it as a result but it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes of boiling a which by the way is a very bad thing and feel like oysters\nAnd ah just letting you know [laughter] not a\nGood or Easter season\nRight I'd hate or the came in in Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida\nAnd and and came came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach while the same place style and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic\nAh east is going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life the span of time but Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic why we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that I ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always\nOften we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nIt is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk and that's where I Am concerned about a lot when it goes through no fault that whole area up there the Hampton\nRoads area that area just floods [laughter]\nYeah and and so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding and Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on and and and central North Carolina right and so it never really picked up in a news\nBut when this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk and Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the end of the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right\nA power outages there's a there's a huge swaths of it's going to be from power outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least to pass Wilmington and and just\nWhere you started to get into the outer banks silenced [noise] um this is widespread power outages and then we also throw in here the tornadoes now tornadoes are kind of different they are\nNormally super cells so where you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty a heading towards\nFor sale so where you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty\nA heading toward Colombia and going through a guest a well that's not the likely place where you got the heavy rain it's where the feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out\nWhere those individual cells and as we start to get in the morning hours for will have an an up tick in the [noise] uh looks called the low level jet stream and wins and we had a little sunshine we're going to see some um\nSome possible super cells developed belong in Los ... and I'm I'm John ... touchdown

tornadoes are typically week there half zero so the F ones [noise] and um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um\nThen they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm in four pieces you've got your your northeast southeast you've got your south west northwest world the [noise] the the one that is closest to the ocean and the\nFurther north than the ... or or are we seeing these individual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida I'm\nA long and near highway Seventy five as as the storm was moving its way through Panama City and northward toward Tallahassee\nInland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bans coming in and we picked up the uh the the tornado activity but ... says this entire system moves forward we've got these threats one or the winds are going to topple trees\nTrees are going to topple power lights a power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas\nAnd possibly into a southern Virginia then we have flooding\nAnd that flooding is going to be\nA long and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up and to the hill country I call it ah the Raleigh and so forth that area is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of ... and so forth hollers [noise] and that all\nCreates its own issue for the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise]\nAnd and then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that we have with this thing [noise] um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm\nAnd it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets out of here leaving Virginia Beach and had been for the uh [noise] and then for the other side of the pond while\nWhile just incredible

us at the bottom of the hour on a hunch that\nAre now down to a tropical storm last update\nWas at one am ah the ah sixty mile an hour consistent wind speed is what we had at that particular a point but it's still a a well defined tropical storm over Georgia entering the south Carolina and will through the day go move up through North Carolina\nAnd parts of uh southeastern Virginia before it heads off\nOr in the Atlantic but ah as a Tom and both the John ... told us a earlier a ... and and they predicted this was a storm that was going to stay together it wasn't going to disperse and it looks like as we talk to Tom last hour he said all the way to Ireland\nOr how it's going to it's going to remain a that there's enough heat even in the uh uh I guess central northern part of the Atlantic and there's still enough heat to keep that together\nAll the way across the big pond which by the way in a way to reach you know near Ireland and Great Britain Sunday\nYeah of out of that is a fast moving storm so we'll have the latest update coming up here in a little bit the other big story a stock market down eight hundred and almost eight hundred and thirty two points and uh yesterday looking at ... or the stocks are overnight everybody's taking a big hit\nA from a from Asia throughout Europe and and also it looks like a that uh the opening looking at the Dow futures right now will be down\nYou know maybe a couple of hundred points to start to start the morning we'll start that will start down a variety of different things\nUh it was interesting 'cause I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has hurting the wall Street Journal and said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category but just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I've talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happened to be talking about that last night\nRight and and we were looking at that at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year\nThat's just in a year it has doubled that you know\nThat means there's more money that the government has to pay out just a for interest you've got the fed now are wanting to uh raise rates history was out or did we do this on the air off the air about\nThese loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate rate it was going to be much higher than expected well when you had delinquency rates are as as they started to creep up and up\nThe forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners\nIt was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than uh than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place well\nWhat do you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework and they should review the data because to his point\nWhat do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about\nA long term effect uh you know you have the gene saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly in some part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials and freight well oil it\nBut that that Senate dimension from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they fight as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should right\nAnd therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should right\nBecause if you were saying that you're raising interest rates um and it is regimented and and\nReally has a you know but if your point is a ... in the administration that they should wait you know Jim Kramer saying it is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well\nYou are admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy\nBy any governing entity is is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be right ... regulation and\nTaxes because that's what a tear ... doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business is always going to hurt\nWell and and that will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds that they believe this has long lived if they if they're going to be long lived if\nIf they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and and the tears even in the situation with China because it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.S\nUh then then the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that that fear become the reality and the economic numbers then the market will also ... and the doorway of\nOr if you see positive news coming out of leadership in Congress or we want to get this NAFTA thing

right and you know so you're you're talking about eleven twelve hundred points\nUh and and who knows what happened the rest of the you know the the day you never know because of the people might try to buy whatever but it's it's the fact that it was as you said when you look at it it was the worry\nFrom the tech companies and a lot of that has to do with regulation ... it's about trade\nAnd as you mentioned the one company as a ... ... right and and the caterpillar\nA company is a deal and international trade their stocks were down right where did people put their money and utilities what does that mean you put it in utilities when you think there's gonna be the there's a possibility of a downturn in the economy ... or say be probably going to be using electricity they're going to be using gas that you have a market\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think the\nNext big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence between the Carolinas that over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nNow and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power\nAnd then you have the question they were staging people for power in Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area a thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nNow they're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas and George and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so now they're going to be working as hard as I possibly can but just the physical flooding and inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit\nThe time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that the landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest Bryant is going to have the longest period of time to restore power I mean [noise]\nFace it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to any more but they still have to be able to address the power line said went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and as you mentioned there may not be a customer are there any longer unfortunately but still is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be\nA half to get that power and habit to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore\nA hurricane Michael again one for the record books you and I ... I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last hour but you you actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about uh uh this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled to nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nEffect in Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it it's something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also want\nGo where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay and and that is it's it's no longer in the it's a no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regain power and that ... power is considered\nOptical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regained power is considered extra tropical but it's ... you write in in nailing it here [noise] the it it may not be the thirty\nDays storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWow it really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling for those professional drivers out there and the high profile trucks I Know that uh that uh Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that are and they know if there are seasoned driver they know\nThat those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will kind of hug I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because that is a main quarter of course between Florida and New York\nWell and um and then go head to some to some degree they're going to have this stuff that they are back in the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five or twenty\nUh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta [noise] and\nBut there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up and the Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington hands to Charlotte every one of those crossroads the ...

McCann Caesar professional basketball player one the incidentally title about Thirteen Years ago as well\nNow author of a new book called plantation education they exploitation of the modern day athletes student and Mr McCain's joins us on the news line what led you to tell your story and the story of others in this book\nWorld history and um [noise]\nThe treatment or be actually nowadays in contradiction of free education do compensation I figured\nI Would do some research and dive deep into the topic a far from clear to you to be able to give to the used in the future generations of the sport some real information inside on the ... the real deal behind as she lay in your education\nWhat is the biggest thing that people don't understand about this you mentioned that those of us on the outside we say well hey they get a free education and it's an even swap and all of that but but what do we not understand that we should\nWill um when you go to work for an employer and you're doing a service when you're producing labor in your employer is reaching all the benefits from all of your labor and you get nothing in return but a piece of paper\nThat piece of paper is not promising you any kind of\nUm future um job opportunity or anything like that so you basically just be a short changed your being cheated\nOr you're you're being corrupted over it was just a lot of things that's just not right about the situation when you could easily just a B that leads to be employed agrees universities\nNow obviously you have had a career in professional basketball but not that many student athletes are able to pursue their dream and I assume for many it is their dream to go onto the next level and and make a good living although it's hard living uh what\nAre they being are are they being not just taking advantage of the ... into thinking that\nThere's this wonderful pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and then they wind up with that piece of paper of a degree and and no hope of translating that into income\nWell I think that the power to go 'cause you'll be something that university and then she dug a lake and give you free and mess valuable information and that in that career field it's caused force education and creating scores education programs allows you\nTo yes we in the information that he was being given to them so if they're being taught how to budget manage and financially become responsible um there'll be more prepared for the professional leagues and also\nAnybody who wants to be a part of sports therapies forest management um want to be a GM or a coach or scorched education would be able to foster that information and be able to create or goes hyper certifications\nIt coach a scorched education wouldn't be able to foster that information and be able to create those type certifications those type\nThose types of valid validation and those fields so we wouldn't would have to work on the buddy system when it comes down to the NBA NFL who's buddies who's ... who can get a new job who can't\nWe have talked about the college situation for some time now that it's gotten us anywhere were really nowhere different than we were a decade or two decades ago but you're suggesting that it's it's a pretty\nThin side situation I don't want to say a dirty situation but it but it's it's a kind of a closed situation when you get to the pros as well and that may not be something that some of us have thought about\nRight [noise] and that's that's just the farm system of it all this you just throw money at the situation is ever going to get better\nAnd that seems to be the only solution that she'd have Laiki come up with but in my book we offered this elusive sports education programs with performance based requirements which you know gets rid of the academic based requirements are forced to your kids to go to classes they're not interested in\nAnd forcing them to be performance based requirements where they actually are performing for the coach and the coaches accountable for grading these players as a teacher\nNow that gives accountability to both the coach and the student to show up perform and give us results and that's how you get paid on both sides\nThe coach doesn't get paid and killed the players show result instead of this team shows results [noise] the player doesn't get paid until she shows progression he shows results this is where we have a ... of around the whole table and everywhere I could get\nPaid on our baseball based upon and perform\nAnd by performance you're not just talking about on the field of play you're talking about as you say with these different sort of educational opportunities that may be more flexible to them as opposed to classes they don't want to attend\nAbsolutely\nWe're talking with retired McCants his book is called plantation education what's been the reaction of people that you have either the ones you went to college with all the ones that you played with or are they supportive of this or are they suggesting that maybe you just don't want to hope that sick right at that part\nWell you know when I first came out um there wasn't a lot of support at all and I'm even currently art is kinda hard to\nTo push the book down anybody's throat but you just want to be able to shine a light or where there is a solution you can't say there's not information on this corruption and its fraud that's out there to every one really paying attention to write out\nNow you got ...\nYou got a ... Johnson the raw plant and bothers in this whole season was predicated towards the whole um exploitation of of athletes student so\nWe're getting a lot of attention with this right now so we just need you know continue supporting people to just really you know go out by the book read a book understand it and join the conversation\nAre you finding it hard to land a plane position because of this public stance that you're taking\nNot at all in our our mom I ... I was like ball weights or book kind of our way before my stance was um really taken [noise] but ah the book is more soldiers given information you know or pan athletes for something they\nThey would never be prepared for it because no one's within the stick their neck out on the line like I Am because of their race and I'm\nThere to lose everything for this information is something that the best Berkeley and understanding that you know you're going to be prepared to dedicate your life to basketball or football there are steps you need to take\nIt's not just a matter of making a few little changes here or there is it I mean you're suggesting a wholesale change top to bottom in how we look at collegiate sports because simply putting a band aid on this problem isn't going to be good enough is that how I hear hear it from you\nAbsolutely because it turns into more of a social issue than it does a sports issue if we continue it out the way it is because there's such a race or connotation\nTied to it when you talk about the history of college explorers and you're talking about the history of the plantation mentality in the Yes sir mentality in the way the bench letter but Saturday\nSo if we can get out of that completely by creating a whole new system that's that's surrounded by performance and surrounded by information in this field so it was just like you have law school\n... business school out there isn't and then there's and then\nYou should have at schools sports or athletes so bread were cultures are glad we're cheat ends up bread were broadcasters I've read so this is what I'm trying to create for a new generation\nWe've got about one minute left you obviously had your own personal experiences you obviously talk to people as you played in the NBA et cetera but you did as you said a lot of research for the book one surprise you as you did the research that you didn't even know about this whole topic\nOf the biggest thing is surprising you were that the news or the national editor of intent as voluntary and that was the most shocking news of of it all and the fact that we sign it\nWithout any legal representation or parental guidance guardianship some of us don't even try it with a ... around and we're Seventeen years old so this contract resigning should become void in itself among signing it\nAnd um they're penalized in these players for using now like this other New Jersey's selling your shoes and ruining their careers over something that's already fraudulent ended a contracting itself\nIs just the way to perpetuate this ownership of the destiny that otherwise should be their own\nRight absolutely\nMr McCain's thanks so much for taking the time more importantly thanks so much for writing the book plantation education the exploitation of the modern day athletes student and good luck with spreading the word on the topic\nSo this is the one to uh pay close attention to let's check the area conditions it is cloudy and

Hi I'm Jody hanky these wrote in in ... a lot of damage if they're not controlled and you're living in the country like\nWhen you are three and four and five feet above flood stage that does not affect as many people directly now as it used to because of buyout so give us a sense Joe winters that suggested we need to recalibrate what we called major flood level because things have changed\nHow high does the water half to get above flood stage for folks who don't normally notice that notice that [noise]\nWell that's that covers the gamut thrive because I'm again I'll I'll I'll speak in terms of hopefully a month and a half from now in our lab he goes to a hundred and four feet roughly as far as the two feet above five hundred year floodplain\nI'm from that point forward ... ... you know we have our emergency response I'll call it a spreadsheet if you will and so we know it Ninety four and a half certain roads are are are cut off now now that like you said is is\nMainly affecting the northern part of Cedar Falls or not as severely unfortunately because the buyouts from oh wait\nA but staff has the lawn and he goes it's it's the city and you know ... rode a ... they live with that for years and they they handle it very well but then there's the outlying streets and access as the black hawk park all those areas\nAs it goes beyond I you know I think around Ninety four is kind of went our staff gets active I might be wrong on that it's just that the numbers bounce back and forth and then you know as it was maybe a month ago or ... ... ... Ninety six to I think it got to that clearly had some some effect on folks up north\nAnd I certainly didn't mean to diminish the impact on people but you do hear folks say and not with malice\nWhen there's a certain level of flooding they say well it's just flooding that people always get flooded than I used to live on the cedar river so I understand the river gets to a certain level you deal with it because you've chosen to live in that location but there is a tipping point where it affects a lot more people and that's kind of what I was\nYou deal with it because you've chosen to live in that location but there is a tipping point where it affects a lot more people and that's kind of what I was getting at it in in the question is\nWe're now to a point because these are going higher and buyouts et cetera that you need to have a much higher level above flood stage before the community is impacted in the same way it might have been a decade or Fifteen Years\nYeah sure absolutely and you know the interesting thing about northern Cedar Falls dealing with the river as they have and and um you know the different areas where they live and um you know that a sort of the the folks who deal with it at whatever level is have dealt with it for a long time to your point and so\nThe main the main idea from the city's perspective as we get the resources out there\nA little bit to your point these folks are resilient and they know I'm you know what happens and they're prepared and it's it's very rare we have someone to get surprised didn't say I don't know what to do it there's water in my basement it's just like living in other places in in in the city if you lived in the bottom of the hill and the\nMiddle of a you know a normal neighborhood you're ... more than if you live at the top of the hill so it uh [noise]\nYou know again we want to keep an eye on it cheaper these services at a at a high level of service and uh I I don't think we'll change any of those numbers just just because it it it may not be the threat we have downtown and throughout to that court or along the river\nOn the north side excuse me this outside but uh you know we want to make sure we're at ... at the service at our resident\nThe governor this morning issued a disaster proclamation for Nineteen counties based upon severe weather that began last Thursday and that does include Black Hawk when the governor does something like that does that have\nAny impact on the municipality or is it just individuals and again if the individuals or health that helps everyone but just to clarify for\nFolks are from what I understand the when the office of the governor sends a sort of things out it it lines folks who qualify to receive whatever age is available\nAgain my understanding is if if if there is someone living in a certain area and they have some uh ability of funds or assistance I Believe it goes through the city and so that that that is how it onto it were the conduit to the state and then in essence sometimes to the fed and knocking sixteen in two thousand they\nGained brown is the mayor of the city of Cedar Falls joining us for his monthly conversation with you all here on news talk Fifteen forty K exhale there is an event tomorrow at the diamond event center called inclusion cedar valley twenty eight teen and this is something that you know you are poured out\nGive us a sense of what this is lots of folks that appears to have banded together\nThey have it's it's really a unique um program and opportunity and speaker that is coming [noise]\nUm it it may or heart and I are are I'm speaking in the morning and I think we have a a luncheon as well uh in in the later earlier afternoon you know it I I back in that to\nCome alongside a an issue that's we've been hearing about for a while now and that is a talent\nGetting talent recruiting talent and increasing the certification of vehicles for talent and this is I I I'm looking forward to the discussion tomorrow to see what that can help fill some voids or whether inclusion whatever that means to anybody out there or if that if that helps set inclusion in the in the private sector and then we can all benefit from that\nI Know there's other areas too in terms of inclusion and in a in education I'm very familiar with that data had been married to a teacher for twenty five years so you know duct seen the tide change with with those sorts of things so I'm looking forward to it it's going to be a good discussion with a lot of different stakeholders\nDiversity ... un I dot edu as a website where you can go to get more information on this and the actual name is engaged in power act economic inclusion and it's free and open to interested persons where's the diamond defense said\nThat is on um [noise] the prairie parkway road side of the western home their new facility they have out there is it not hard to find you can go down very park layer circle the western home and you'll see it\nAnd I wanted to ask because again the name is new enough that people might be that had not understand where it is but it's right off very part way in that western home area\nYes I think I Am not going to go with the direction of things in an ironically and the diamond event center is named after a wonderful capital or in our city with some real uh I'm\nNot giving in their blood they they they were very generous to to have that gift a song ... joined and I think diamond who who actually gave money for that is awesome\nInclusion cedar valley twenty Eighteen sponsored by a variety of entities including the human rights commission's of their respective cities Waterloo in Cedar falls\nTalk about the role of something like the human rights commission is it simply I think in the early days of these things it was where people would file complaints\nOr if someone was treating them badly wasn't limited to the city but it was the city to help an individual out but it's a much broader mandate though\nIt is you know like you said maybe early days and that and even now it's his first complains to be filed it's also for individuals to know their rights within the law [noise]\nUm and our group we have a wonderful staff member that that helps run that you know they they have their meetings um two wonderful group of people great volunteers for the city and in some folks may not realize I think it was last year there was an issue\nUm I think it it went up to high school in Cedar falls into these folks got together to make sure they really ironed out what was going on\nReally ironed out the options that were available and and I guess sort of sifted through things to say you know here's where we're landing on this we're on agreement with this and it's an abundance of of you are a different people so it's not you know all\nBusiness people or something like that and so they collectively got together and um I sincerely don't remember the issue but it was it was satisfied to completion by all parties when all is said and done so that's better than having it go off in different directions and down rabbit holes that don't solve the problem\nAnd so I've been really encouraged by that group and and really appreciate their service the city\nBecause again it's the sort of thing that when people have a concert and it is something that is under that category or rubric\nYou really sort of need that independent arm within the city because almost by definition there's a problem going through the normal channels and so you need that uh we would call them an ... person or somebody that is a bit detached\nTo actually have the distance necessary to give guidance to you in the city officials as to the proper steps to take\n... yeah it keeps 'em uh the elected officials staffing and other stakeholders keenly aware of of what might be happening or what the discussions currently our\nGym round is the mayor of the city of Cedar Falls will continue with him after a break for business news and weather coming up\nOn taxi alive and local here on the voice of eastern Iowa and he was dark Fifteen forty a actually ah\nGet more with McGrath cabin or affordable

my craft ... came out there you are at least that's what the ... credit twenty four Ninety nine down at a camp zero to six eight to five twenty nine Ninety nine down ...\nI'm Danny leopard with tips for today's homeowner [noise]\n\nPay actually alive and local continuing on this Thursday and we are continuing with the mayor the city of cedar\nFalls Jim Brown it's his monthly visit to the studio last month when you were here we talked about firefighters and public safety officers and some folks who had left the department\nThat issue has not gone away in fact things it would appear have escalated up dead\nSo I Want to take a step back before we dive into the present talk about the makeup of the fire department the police department public safety officers how that fits in to the city of Cedar Falls plans from your standpoint is the leader of city government\nAnd how that model is different from what people may know in Waterloo or other places\nSure so ... you know some variation of the public safety model we're currently looking at it's been around for at least Fifteen Years or assistant police chief is a police officer he has been a public safety officer I think for fourteen years so these ... there's it's been around that long\nAnd it's worked you look at the facts you which we have to do we have to remove the motion of it on I I get the motion of it all but really the goal of the highest level that I see is that\nThe next two to four years we're going to increase the police department from anywhere from forty to sixty percent meanwhile we have firefighters showing up at the scene in the range of Fifteen to Nineteen firefighters unheard of in any organization or any city our size [laughter] and so\nYou know and so many respond when there is a call that's how many are mobilized by definition and design\nYes yes and so you you know you you have to look at that and say that's a pretty good model you look at the crime nationally and we're still very fortunate in Cedar falls that's low but nationally crime is going up\nFires by definition are going down we had six to ten structure fires last year so I Would simply ask the folks where do you want that emphasis on dollars and the efficiency right now it's the police if you can imagine increasing a police force in any city by forty or sixty percent and it's still have that coverage whether it's\nA you know a a a a structure fire or a car upside down whatever the case might be to have that kind of coverage at the scene\nSo this this is a ration over the last six weeks losing five firefighters is never good there's good expertise there and now we're moving for our ... our of our current police supervisors over to a public safety roll with in the fire department\nAnd that's a natural so natural progression from where council has approved an almost unanimously that's the direction they want to go and so it is unique it's different\nUm you have ... you need to build instantly efficiencies no matter where you are because every city in Iowa we just got done through with the the roll back with the state dollars folks don't get that roll back the next few years where are they going to find the dollars to fund these these entities the public safety sectors\nAre there's nowhere else to go in Cedar falls I think is ahead of the curve\nDefined what public safety officer is and how is that job if you will different from traditional firefighter traditional peace officer\n[laughter] well it's it's it's probably more of a play on words if you will so if I go into the police station I'm Talking to police officers um majority of those police officers are also public safety officers\nSo if I go into the police station I'm Talking to police officers\nUm majority of those police officers are also public safety officers now they still say police on their badge and they still patrol and they go try to catch the bad guys\nIf there's an emergency call they are almost then up ESL a public safety officer\nAnd the same thing with fire although it's not as dramatic in the numbers the firefighters the firefight I go to the fire station which I did last week I went to all three shifts and talk to them the firefighters that the fire station or a firefighter a few of them do cross train over to the police side and so at night\nMaybe on the weekends may be at home coming for Cedar Falls we need the extra coverage and the police side\nThose folks become a police officer so it it\nGets limited number of people who have cross trained so they have their primary function mhm but they have cross trained to do some of the role of the other athletes safety division if you will and so what you're doing is you have some people who know\nOne job and you have others who knew a little bit about the other\nAbsolutely and those those same PS so they're not released to the fire station until they get their police training down police academy they they do some field training and they have some other steps they go through\nAnd they get certified firefighter one certified and so from from that point forward they get all the training that a new firefighters you call them a firefighter coming in would get\nRiver rescue hazardous material to tie quarters real life fires with some ... buyout homes we had a north all those I've been on and when they got sued up you don't know the difference you don't know the difference who's there but you know experts are there on the field assisting with whatever the incident might be\nThis is going to sound like a very flip question and I don't mean to be but you have explained the situation where you have people who are dual certified if you will and again these are my terms but I that's how I understand it the ... part is what's the problem\nBut obviously there are some people who do have a problem with it from your standpoint what is the concern that is being raised as to is it an idea that that\nThere won't be enough your people on each end or what\n[noise] it it runs the gamut time sure if you go asked uh if if you ask five different people they'd have different reasons to be upset about it um there's a rich culture and fire I get that I understand that\nThere might be some turf protection there I I get that to um the whole idea for us though for me personally is our city safe yes it is are we are we fish and absolutely get a quick idea is that we have some detectives that are public safety officers\nWhen they when they are on shift to be a fire fighter maybe is for a month maybe it's for a year who knows\nThey are still able to sit in their down time at the fire station and do their detective work it's all computer it's it's phone forensics all those things and meanwhile there is a call I guess what they are on the truck just as fast as a career individual down there so those are the efficiency that are built in there and the problem with it\nI ... I I don't know it's a it works we've been safe the last Fifteen Years five years I I guess there's nothing necessarily to point to to say that's bad in my opinion because again it's been around for about Fifteen Years some variations of it and it works\nThe career firefighters are unionized correct yes this is my ignorance is your career police force you you know absolutely have they indicated any concern the police union oh\nNo absolutely not they know are fighters union have they have the the leadership of the firefighters um it's difficult to you know they have filed six or seven grievances against the city the last probably six to nine months we haven't had six or seven grievances the last ten years\nUm it's been conveyed to staff by by the two leaders that we're not we're not looking for solutions on some of these um uh grievances are waves of communicating is through grievances\nThat costs a lot of money a lot of staff time a lot of a lot of time with the attorneys here locally and in Des Moines\nSo um yeah they're they're having difficulty with the police union or they'd been on board they're they're they're good to work with if we have some issues come in and talk to the director and an assistant chief say how how can we worked this out yet we did that wrong we're going to correct that all these different factors\nThat the police officers who are who are are cross trained and vice versa do get additional dollars\nThey probably like that for in terms of a visual duties that they're doing um [noise]\nBut it it they understand that within the next couple of ... probably the next year we will have I think roughly fifty nine\nPolice officers who are cross trained as firefighters their PS says fifty nine out of\nHow many total and the police force\nOh they're they're I think there's maybe five or six that aren't PS as well just fine you know it's it is\nNot essentially for all intents and purposes the entire police department will be ... cross train essential\nYes you know and I and I I beg your pardon I I might have that wrong I Believe will have fifty nine firefighters ready in terms of both career and public safety officers who are trying to fire fighter one status and getting additional training so\nYou know you you got to look at that those facts you got to look at um of how it's affecting the safety of our city and and I think we're on the right track especially next year when we moved into the new public safety building this can be huge\nThere was a news release issued by the firefighters association that is the union indicating that the transfer that you mention of the for public safety officers to the fire department is illegal\nOr what is your reaction to that obviously the first reaction is we didn't think it was illegal or we wouldn't have done it I mean I get that but what what's the reaction to how this is all now playing out\nYes I well I'm One of the reactions from folks I talked to a sort of here we go again\nUm you know you can eat it and and there's a process to um greed that out to see if it's legal or not legal I don't know those details I can trust that they've they've crossed teasing dotted eyes towards that in the the fact remains a those for going down to at some level supervised the fire department\nOur number one firefighters and previously before they moved to Cedar Falls there marine combat veterans some are award winning for the valor they've they've done both as a police officer and I think in the military they've had a schooling for\nCommunity planning and development director ... city staff simply made a mistake\nThat from this past Monday Waterloo city council meeting ... mark Morris preparing that report for us\nComing up tomorrow on can actually all live in local well we'll have the scouting report you expect that on Fridays\nAs well Fox News radio legal analyst and practicing attorney Wendy Patrick will join us for the reporter's notebook segment and we have a few dozen other things planned between two and four as well\nWe uh the other day we're going to tell you about highway twenty and a big commemoration this coming up next week that was preempted by tornado coverage we'll bring you that in this hour well presuming there's no tornado alley not tomorrow was well Gary rhyme it has on breast Rowan that's coming up next on TALK to you tomorrow after rush\nAnd voice of eastern Iowa\nTalk forty K.

K. U. C. L. dot com it's an email to that address we may read all or parts of it\nHe's doing some things but it's still very limited in what he can do so he won't play this week and I anticipate the ... will be the guy a ... and ... the backup right now but a capable backup who's played winning football at Iowa State so you feel good about him in that role right now but\nAh let's face it you're not going to have a guy go out and put up the numbers that product at a week ago and then not him start the game this week and it'll be as first start he didn't start that came last week it's gonna be a night game with a tremendous environment I'm sure as adrenaline will be pumping but boy you couldn't tell that it was the other day he just looked like this was just a second nature to him and\nAnd uh I again I think it comes back to how well coach he must have been has a high school football player to just step right into that kind of thing\nYou look for David Montgomery to be back in the lineup on Saturday Night against West Virginia\nYeah sure hope so Gary I'm I think he's doing better I'm I'm hopeful that he'll be out there I I Want to see what the combination of block party and David Montgomery can do you know we've yet to see that and\nUm [noise] it's exciting to think what David can do with a little bit more room to run and hopefully the threat of Brock running the football will will open up some more calls for for David\n... and we've got a credit the office of wind to they have really come on I mean that was a place that a lot of people were critical of early in the season to maybe deservedly so but I think as the seasons gone on\nThey've gotten better every single week and\nUh I thought they did a great job last weekend at Oklahoma State so that can open up some holes for David as well so uh there's some resist me excited if he can get out there I I I'm hopeful that he'll be able to go I'm not hearing anything negative on him right now so hopefully he's a good to go this weekend\nJohn West Virginia comes to Iowa State this weekend for a night kickoff jak Tyson's going to be rock and they have playoff hope they get a heightened Kennedy quarterback how does this site alone especially defense slow down this high powered West Virginia often\nWell and I think the the on paper you'd say will use the same formula that you did last week a against um Oklahoma State with a high powered passing off ... but\n... years at a different level when he gets the ball out really quickly so I don't know that you're going to have the opportunity to get as many Saxon tackles for last this week just because career as a quick release\nAnd they're off to set up for quicker throws and they have a really really good set of receivers but yeah that's ... that's ... million dollar question Ken this defense rise to the occasion now one thing West Virginia has done a little bit this season probably more than they'd like his turn the ball over\nOr not they have an trailed any football game all year they've had the lead all the way through which is hard to believe but they haven't played the super challenging schedule yeah they were scheduled to play North Carolina state at North Carolina state it got hurricane doubt that would have been a good test North Carolina states also undefeated\nUm but they haven't really played the big dogs in the big twelve yet and their their schedule unlike Iowa state's is really back loaded I states was front loaded so it'll be interesting to see how it plays out on Saturday Night but\nUh this is a West Virginia program that's really handle I stay pretty handily a in recent years they've won five out of six in the series the games I just for some reason I was state has never really played all that well against West Virginia last year they did rally\nFrom twenty to nothing down and had a chance to win that game ended up getting ... to sixteen but\nI I just never feel like we've seen the the best Iowa State against West Virginia and obviously\nA lot of that his credit to them because they played well against the cycle and so we'll see if I was there may be due to put out a good performance against these guys and a defensively um they're going to have to be really sure taxpayers are they're going to have to force West Virginia to to sustain drives\nOr maybe ... get him to commit a turnover too that's something Kansas was able to do last week\nUm but it's it's going to be a challenge ... the real deal he's averaging three hundred sixty passing yards of game he's thrown for Twenty one touchdowns in five games this season hasn't had the game yet where he's throwing for less than three touchdowns so he's definitely a guy that's being mentioned as a Heisman Trophy possibility and deservedly so\nJohn ah you you mentioned a West Virginia bring what sex than the nation and I I don't have their schedule in front of me but ... would you say I was ... at least to date would be their most formidable opponent of the teams that they played so far this year then\nYeah I think that's probably accurate Gary you know I mean they open with Tennessee in a neutral say came in Charlotte which I think a lot of people were excited about it was kind of a sexy matchup but Tennessee hasn't really\nDone a lot and so um I Do think this is probably the best test they faced especially coming on the road into jak traced stadium on a on a night game on Saturday ah it's gonna be a great environment is gonna be charged up [noise]\nUm I I think it is their best test to date but I'm sure they're excited to prove that they belong and that they're not a a flu key number six team in the country and that they're absolutely legitimate and and this is a great chance for them to start establishing that and so um I think it'll be a both teams given at their best shot on Saturday she'll be a lot of fun\nJohn Walters play by play voice I with states ... radio network on our village in VIP hotline what yeah what kind of deep dense well Brock partying and David Montgomery and that often the blind and receivers what what are they going to go up against when you look at the the mountain near defense each side of the football\nWell to date a the best defense in the big twelve at least since ... they are\nA number one in scoring defense given up buddy team points a game now again they haven't played\nSome of the teams that the other teams in the league play so I think that's part of it but you know for a team that a year ago gave up thirty one points game to be given up a teeny game this year I think that's why they've taken that big step forward their defense has really improved they brought in some transfers on that side of the ball Kenny big oil\nAh they're they're big nose guard kind of does for their defense what ray Lima does fry was states defense\nHe's a transfer grad transferred from USC they brought in grad transfer from Clemson who stepped in defense of and and uh they're corners are all a junior college guys that have stepped in and played well so they've had an influx of talent on that side of the ball and they're very aggressive a scheme although they do have a three man front um they come after\nYou and they have always been a really hard hitting team when I was state spaced him that's been one thing that's kind of been they're calling card they're very very physical so um you know I think it's a good test drives states ... and the good test for ... and\nYou know it'll be interesting to see if they can get the ball going a little bit get West Virginia back on their heels a little bit because as I mentioned dam and trailed in the game yet the season in fact you know they've been out to double digit leads\nA you know fourteen denouncing tend enough and Twenty one Twenty one nothing that's been the case every week for these guys and so if I was sick and get them back on their heels a little bit and and get a lead in this game it'd be really interesting to see how West Virginia reacts to that because they haven't been in that position yet the season\nYeah it could be one of the keys to the game right there as they get on top early and and see how uh how the mountaineers react after not trailing all season long ah is the game\nIm right there is to get on top early and and see how uh how the mountaineers react after not trailing all season long ah is the game's sold out or tickets still available sounds like a cycle nation should be pretty wrapped up and excited to just fill jak try stadium for this one on Saturday\nYou I don't I don't it's not sold out yet I'm a ... ticket sales have been good um there are still tickets available for his was forty dollars um I Would expect that if it's not sold out that it'll be close to that uh probably in the neighborhood of\nYou know fifty to sixty thousand somewhere in there um but it's going to work really full no matter what it always does and\nI'm going to be a great charged up environment I night games are fun in that stadium and and the weather shaping up a little bit better than what we've been seeing here for the last couple of weeks it's been kinda gloomy and\nDepressing almost and um [noise]\nYou know that that certainly doesn't help ticket sales when people say are we going to get a fall or not but I think now they could feel a little light at the end of the tunnel literally with the sun coming out for lunch and\nThen can get excited about the Saturday\nGreat day at tailgating leading up to that kick off against a number six rank West Virginia

Joe welcome to the show how's everything in Vermillion South Dakota\nWell believe it or not uh Gary the the sun is out um but right as I understand just for a little while it's just been\nBut really been miserable here you know the last week and a half um we had an eighty six degree day a week ago yesterday and then the the bottom fell out we haven't we haven't had that hurt breeze yet but cold rain\nCold weather I mean it's just a it's just not fair you know in the fall but uh you know that's\nThat's life in the upper Midwest as you know and I'm In a you know just as a as as was said before a good thing of both the Panthers and the coyotes have a dome otherwise it'd be a great day to run the football\nYeah thank goodness for the decoded dome no doubt about it we're not going to be snow on the ground or when we get up there this weekend is there\nNo but that that happened a little little ... little northwest them a little west of us here but uh no they're looking for some of these guys fifty seven outside the dome up or Saturday\nThere's two teams left in the Missouri valid football conference that are on beating in league play we played one of 'em this last Saturday in North Dakota state the or\nThe overwhelming favorite to win the title again this year and then you guys the coyotes you're out doing to want to start again in league play what have you seen out of out of South Dakota football so far\nWell Gary and especially uh\nIn ... play what have you seen out of out of South Dakota football so far\nWell Gary and especially in the valley a you know to a too big wins and of course uh any a game you went on the road like the coyotes data to southern Illinois and then I'm coming back home you know for the first time in a month\nAnd playing Missouri state or on Dakota day ah you know you'll take that certainly the coyotes are finding ways to win I mean it's been two different wins or in the valley is so far um you know the coyotes where one on one\nOr going into their game with a waiver state but a waiver state had an outstanding game plan on defense they they have the sense of wind up back on their heels they had Austin Simmons\nOr running for their lives so um you know a disappointing and frustrating last back in September so the coyotes had to do over that over the by week and then start the valley on the road at southern Illinois\nAnd really the first half of the southern Illinois game didn't go all that great as well although the coyotes got a great drive at the end of the first have only got a field goal out of it but that to jumpstart the off chance\nAs the coyotes who had not scored a point in the third quarter up to that southern Illinois game had a Twenty one points in the quarter and eventually uh you know came away with the wind um southern Illinois scored with about a minute to go up but the coyotes were in a ... defense\nOf them and we're able to get the un side kicked in and and get the big road when and last week against a Missouri state I'm\nIn Missouri state to is I think vastly improved I mean I think they certainly well some people up a by beating the Illinois state at home and then the week before beating up a good or northern Arizona team or from the from the big sky\nSo I mean it was two different games two different ways to win\nAnd uh you know the ... and defense is the is the name of the game for the coyotes right now the fences\nDoing its thing you know like the last couple of years with Chris Traveller uh Austin Simmons is doing a great job of running the coyote often it's\nJoe you when you're three and two overall you're tuned elite that's not a bad spot to be sitting there and you just mentioned the Austin Simms has been really good he's thrown for sixteen hundred yards ten touchdown only three interceptions it just the title off and said it's going to look to sling all over the field on Saturday\nWell it's funny that you have that chance that because of the running game a finely uh got going\nUh it's it's been kind of just a you know trying to get started and\nAh last week or ... or got his start\nAt a at running back and he made the most of his opportunity Ninety eight yard so rushing or where the coyotes had only been averaging Ninety seven yards as a team\nOr through the uh through the southern Illinois a game of and he and a random thought were were running hard and that ah that seems to take the pressure off a Austin Simmons or a little bit ah he's been getting a time to throw 'em you know after the waiver state gain the confidence of wind\nUm you know went back to the basics of you know back to a blocking schemes and also some a personnel tweaks\nA MBA line and ah you know certainly they're uh they're playing a probably their best foot ball or right now has a we're getting into the third game of the valley\nWe're talking with Joel thing Gore he is the play by play voice of the south Dakota ... radio network he's on her village in VIP hotline\nOr five games into this thing and and uh uh Chris mentioned it to Austin Simmons your quarterback\nOne thousand five hundred and Ninety nine yards passing on the year already over three hundred yards per game are quarterback we think he's a a pretty good throwing quarterback he liked done six hundred and thirty three yards are almost a thousand more yards through the air in a\nIn Europe first five games compared to you when I ...\nIt is a is it a pass first off since I I Know Ben ... got to go on running the football but a\nMan Austin ... it's got a a big stable have wide receivers it looks like the passing game is is pretty outstanding for you guys five games into this season show\nWhether there's no doubt to Gary and uh you know you mentioned it to the you know the big stable above receivers of it's been more the norm than the exception that to ten or eleven guys are getting a catches a per game uh and it's been\nSomebody different really uh every week I'm a Levi foul ...\nOf the car Allen a trust in ...\nI'm also a Randy Baker you know he's had his moments are as well but uh the coyotes or you know not only using you know the receivers you know the tight end so Brett Sampson encounter Herman Koch passes a band class and a ... Henry Epcot passes a out of the backfield\nAs well you know it's it you know the obviously the the the goal\nAnd I know you know you and I is enjoying this you know the great balance between the run a and the past but um you know it's the wave offensive coordinator ... sees it um you know for if the coyote surpass heavy um you know usually it's a a a call for a run first but\nYou got to take a what the defense gives you an to an obviously uh Austin has had um you know time to uh to check off hand you know select the passing in instead of a run with the ... the temple off into the ...\nWhen I'm really shows the complex they have in Austin Simmons which is always a good thing and when he when he's thrown for the yards and ... and he has always means he has a pretty good off its of line up front what kind of all lined the coyotes have this season\nWell it's a it's an experience wind um you know there is a lot of um you know of and especially toward the end of the year uh you know when the coyotes made the playoffs for the first time a you know the coyotes were [laughter]\nYou know really really beat up in that sense of wind but a lot of guys that were young got to play last year either in a backup rules or even starting rules and more toward the or the end of the season it's an experience\nA off sense of wine um you know a Nick Johnson who was a hometown boy I'm from Vermillion has been salad\nAt a left tackle a Tyler Sarah\nAs a move from a lifeguard to center\nMason shy dagger whose um you know from a from western Iowa has moved to a to life guard a also a Cody Jennings has been a pretty steady right tackle coyotes have had to use a somebody different that a white guard between the brain Schneider\nAnd ah and Austin Wallace the two young players\nUh but uh you know certainly they are uh you know complimenting one another um you know ones will get to start one week and the other will get it or get a start but I think you know the office of wine or even though they got you know\nYou know ones will get to start one week and the other will get a get a start but I think you know the office of wine or even though they got you know a really back on their heels against the waivers status as I mentioned playing their best foot ball right now\nOn a number of Iowa guys on this South Dakota roster not only quarterback Austin Simmons from Council Bluffs and Mason shy digger from Fonda I open a number of a former Iowa high school football players play for coach Nielsen and South Dakota we'll see um Saturday Night in the Dakota DOMA six PM kicked off\nOr when when you look at the match up with you and I are from the south Dakota side of it what's what's the thought what's the talk what's the discussion about\nFacing the human eye Panthers at at your place Saturday Night\nWell ah of course a coach deal sending coach Farley a you know they've known each other for a long long time um you know coach Nielsen even when he was at work were college\nUh you know used to you know pick the brain of coach a parlay who was an assistant you know half the half the time or or even you know I Know he played in the in the eighties for you and I but uh in successive years\nYes free housing if you don't believe me check it out for yourself visit them on Facebook or have their home builders duck or do you\nWill back taxes to the IRS you may qualify for the first George program civic tax relief can give you free information on how the program works they're professionals\nHave over twenty five years of experience negotiating with the IRS they know the proper steps to save you the most amount of money they will negotiate your ... and protect you from bank ... wage garnishment\nCalled for your free fresh start information now\nEight hundred number five five eight four OH that's eight hundred nine calling finally be for a week eight hundred and five five eight four oh wait\n[noise] our number one is in the book stay with us our two is coming up after news and whether we're back why but the old pie you after this\nVoice of eastern Iowa\n...\nCedar\n\nAnother sell off on Wall street ...

to seven or eight favored depending on where you want to work and um you know a game that Iowa has to kind of show up and take care of business again you know it's kind of a a string of the ... or the

worst is\nA veteran or a name that has been circulating for a while\nUm and I think it was this week was actually the one year anniversary of when he cracked\nThe starting lineup so a guy who are even in recognition is not exactly been a Hawkeye or for a long time and he's already kind of viewed as one of the uh I don't know veteran in the right word but one of the established pieces on that often so blind and\nYou know it's an often do blind that I was only given up five ... this year which is the top a top number in the Big Ten um and it's an office of line that you know at the beginning of the season was probably one of the\nI guess question marks based on Iowa standard province of lines I'm In that unit is really kind of come together are you getting ranger's kind of the leader there but worse is certainly a growing in a morphing into kind of a more established peace in that that line has been big in\nA you know giving they Stanley time and letting him throw for the numbers that he has especially the run game is kind of taking some time to to really heat up\nSo um you know one name that\nI think a lot of Iowa fans expect to see on Sundays at some point interest to worse still

to do is um when you think about uh going through a basketball season and then\nYou know all of a sudden having to pivot and get ready for baseball season that's already a month into play uh whenever I was basketball season ends and march\nUm and then trying to ah from all indications in the fall hop into starting line up and and you know we'll see how quickly Rick how're might need him to contribute but\nUm you know I just I just don't think people fully realized how difficult what he's trying to do is I'm ... and we'll see how it unfolds over his time in Iowa but um you know with him being sick and injured last year and didn't get to\nThe first year that he really wanted was set a decision so um you know for me that's that's going to be one of the biggest things to monitor this year I'm you know obviously the the big narrative is\nJust you know how does Iowa come back from what was a dismal season on all fronts I'm with basically the same group so I I think uh you know even though it it kind of loses\nIts spot or in the spotlight until football in I mean this Iowa basketball season is going to be pretty fascinating well whichever way it ultimately unfolds\nThey released their full schedule a awhile ago to and and what what's the thought on the the non conference schedule that they have put together is a competitive enough is it a a strong non conference schedule or ... what was the thought on that\nYeah you know I I think everybody certainly would like to see it a little better um you know that's kind of the the growing narrative among fans um but you know I think if if they take care of the opportunities they have\n'em and get some help you know that that's a big part of a schedule is is you know in determining the toughness of it at least is is how did the teams on the schedule perform or as the year goes on and um\nA schedule is is you know in determining the tightness of it at least is is how did the teams on the schedule perform a ... year goes on and um you know I think there are some opportunities for Iowa to get\nEven non conference wins and didn't have those teams go on and have it and um but you know I think\nI think as much as anyone around here with no um yeah I think most people would probably like you said a little tougher but but I think if they if they take care of business when when the opportunities that I think it should

Nick Alice and the guys up front in the trenches\nI tell you what you and I it probably in the same boat that there'll be wait and see what who walks out on the field on Saturday morning or just the one of the first times in a while but I haven't been able to get out to practice this week and even if I had seen in a a I think I Would have been sworn to secrecy until at least Saturday yeah so uh you know ... that's that's\nI don't know if that's an ethical thing again that's that's the thing that's ... that's ... hand kept him like three times this will be the third year in a row a that's a that's a recurrent injury but that'd be a tough one you know that means now your shift and people around Spencer brown moves over to the left and\nIncomes Matthew vendor slice of the right and he's he's still growing into that six seven six eight body but his he's still only like two hundred and sixty pounds so you know he's not really a full fledged right tackle but that's probably the line up and and you got pilot button you plant right guard to now with the Nick Alice out now\nI I did see I can say on Monday I saw like Alice out running on the field so you know I think he's closer closer he they were putting him through the paces so that's the guy that could potentially get back but the ... definitely I'd say that's going to be a day that's day to day it's going to be a game time decision whether he sits up on a Saturday Night it got to be\nFrustrating for the ... just when it looked like the office was catching strike catching some rhythm with the running game against north or a ... against Indiana State a lot of yards on the ground got the passing game going against\nNorth Dakota state with three hundred and sixty two yards through the air or four hundred and one four hundred and sixty six yards of total ... against North Dakota state and now all of a sudden a couple of banged up often see blind man\nYeah you know you you you are touched on it but that's the only four times since two thousand eleven that North Korea states a lot more than thirty points in the game\nSo put that perspective what you and I did there and I tell you that they were close a trigger a couple of more scores there and the fourth quarter they missed a just a couple of throws were just a little bit off when they were trying to move to get back and yeah I Know when they fell down thirty five thirty one they were there was a couple of players that they just messed if they would have gotten those that would have been [noise]\nWhile you know Katie by the door or maybe they would have you know they could have would have been a really interesting finished but uh yeah that's that's tough you know but I think you know the officers line you know they've been building a building they got about twenty bodies in there so I think they've been building Depp\nSo they've been able to absorb it how much more can they absorb of another guy goes down that's that's a key there but I think they got ...

C. F. courier dot com or in there a printed sports section on a daily basis but when you talk defense\nThe you an ID things had nine that shut out quarters in a row going back to the fourth quarter against Iowa\nHow big a concern is that on what happened to that panther defense on Saturday did North Dakota state expose something North Dakota states running game and ... just that good that you just you can't\nStop 'em well what what did you take away from the panther defensive effort on Saturday\nWell there there there's ... there's some thoughts of and think about I took a house but Johnson dumped nuts when I got here but there's a little bit about that a North Korean state the way they they they were going to come out yeah and I think they saw something where they they thought they could get to the edge and as I mean they were as a man a man and you and I didn't get off the blocks make tackle some space in a that was\nA two things that kill them because uh you know almost every first out I I\nI I didn't go back and look it up in North Korea said how do they average in seven or eight yards and first down on a rush I mean it was it was big they were going to I mean they were stuck in the short when you get second a short cut that off and wants to be tough to stop and ah they they really they just came after him and you know a surprising but\nA ... and there's some things that we talked I talked to touch on with coach Farley that we've got to think about to finally said there's inconsistency there\nAnd then I think one thing people might forget here you know we've gotten so used to stellar stellar defense if but if you think about this look at at every level last year last year they lost\nThe Adam ... play like an all American level last year at line Becky last year if you don't know how much he covered up last year ... he played at all American level and then in a secondary you had a logic Campbell who played it on all American little all those guys are gone and then you lose mouse in Washington who was in an NFL cap for awhile\nAnd Princeton woods who gobbled up a lot in the middle yeah look at all those ... so you're going to see some in ... I think there's some talented players there\nBut you gotta look when you lose a especially far they've probably is a big one here and you know he's the guy that covered up a lot of stuff from sideline to sideline and Chris ... is doing a wonderful job as a freshman but it's not the same he's not the same level player yet\nYeah can you be there maybe but you know this is the value of it but he's you know he's doing a wonderful job is leading the team tackles among the top two I think in the valley but the problem is there's other things you know we were with the blind guy that we're not seeing the things that coaches the that they'll posing coaches see too so you got to look at all that talent is gone the last two years\nThere's other things you know we were with the blind that we're not seeing the things that coaches the that they'll opposing coaches see too so you got to look at all that talent is gone the last two years you had to think there was going to be a drop off at one point that that that you and I built on defense was going to drop off and now they're building it back up there's a lot of young guys up there playing you know and\nYou know and you look at all I've after two ... Brooklyn's last year was a huge edition late middle of the year and they were before that that Sean Dexter I mean these two big claiming I mean there's a lot of talent is left in the last two years\nYou know and you're you're talking about you have to fill and you've got to fill in but you know that's that's all the the town they've lost the last couple of years as really a lot and so you're seeing the you know some young guys that are they're going to see some as consistent play because they go out and hold a South Korean that's after thirty points a game to Penn\nThat's inconsistent they could go out and do it you know [noise]\nMarket Laurie Farley we needed one more boy we needed a follow up to to ah Jake and shared with one more sun ... to put in their ... ... ... what is it the first time in seven or eight seasons that there hasn't been a Farley in the middle of that paying their defense as a linebacker\nYeah you know ... a big one in you know and what we did we touched that we've talked a lot about this Jake Hartford was going to be that guy he was a bigger and probably [noise]\nJared if you're listening you work the fastest stuff the guys you just knew how to get their Jake was a bigger and faster version of Jake Farley are Jared J. can't Jared pilots you know six three to twenty five [noise] and it could cover a lot of ground and [noise]\nWithout him that the inter that's holding him out you know whether he ever gets back on the field [noise]\nIt was a big blow the paint their faces a really good quarterback in senior eastern stick last week for North Dakota state I this honest in ... uh the junior quarterback\nFor South Dakota's thrown for almost sixteen hundred yards already this year I I was talking with their radio guy earlier and just ... I mean when we were sharing those numbers I had a quick look 'cause he like dance thrown for six hundred and thirty three yards Austin Simmons is thrown for one thousand five hundred and Ninety nine yards\nAnd he's also a a pretty good running quarterback he's got a couple of rushing touchdowns that defense is going to face another dual threat type quarterback he he's not eastern stick but he's pretty darn good Austin Simmons is\nYeah pretty really this guy out of Council Bluffs another one or a native I on on on their roster um you know [noise]\nUh you know if he's a you know it's a different than Chris travel he's not as big\nYou know he's not as fast but he can get it done with his feet there ... there are throwing off at they're going to throw the ball you know I think he and three of us five star trees had thrown for more than three hundred thirty yard\nSo they're gonna they're gonna wind up all around [noise] ah the key here's can they you and I make them almost one

sixteen hundred yards they throw for three Nineteen again that there are a really often see\nJuggernaut if you will they average over four hundred and twenty four yards of ... going up and down to feel pretty good right now how big a challenge for coming off North Dakota state and now another op and she team that can really move it how how big a challenge is this for the panther deep and\nWell you you you said it already I mean nobody else was stopped them I mean their role in that uh you know thirty I think your average in thirty five to forty points a game and they play they played some good football team so you know it's [noise] and when you go back and watch the film always stop them yet so that's that's the challenge asleep\nWhat have you seen out of them in their in their running game\nThere's solid in Iran and game I mean they they do enough and they're run game that uh they're passing game is Iran game because there are always showing the quick outlet passes and and if you don't you don't you know short beer loose ends on the quick outlets and they're gonna do then the run game will hurt you and they'll pop through on the run game so\nUh they're they're running back is getting stronger each week and get better but uh like you said nobody stopped him yeah what\nDo they look like defensively what what have you seen on on tape as you prepare ... to to go up against that coyote deep and they've got a new\nDefensive coordinator much more sound of what they're doing this year and what much more a fundamentally uh uh in line with what you say this is a very disciplined defense\nIn talking with their radio guy earlier and I know station there\nAre a lot of respect from their head coach Bob Nielsen towards you and your program or just they talked about how uh when he was at work bird used to even you know come and talk with you and I coaches and uh he's had success for every he's gone a\nCouple of great veteran coaches going at it and you against coach Nielsen on Saturday Night\nWell it's it's I tell you what Bob Bob the they're probably one of the most intelligent man you'll made as far as you know and just there's a class act and and always has been from his work birthdays and I remember I was an assistant he'd always come down to to meet with it was Terry Allen staff at the time and that's and\nWhen he was coaching and I've always kept track of him and we you know we've we've always talked in and and stay in touch with each other when he was at dilute and\nSteven's point and all the way through so you know he's he's a very good man and a and he's got a very good program\nAnd and it just the always seemed like he has his team's well prepared when he you know whether it's at western Illinois you're now it's South Dakota you've had some some great games against his team's code were playing a few times [laughter] it's like everybody\nYou know he's one of the ones that's been around but he'll get it at the same school as you he's he's he's been in a couple of different ones but with is probably our six outing together or something like that are six six game against each other so you know it's there's a lot of similarities and that's where\nThey even as us last week's game between a North Dakota's climbing in and and uh and uh uh messing ham you know talking to them before the game was fun but you're saying the same defense they're playing the same defense and we're playing basically or vice versa and or the officers were different but the defense were\nWere very very similar because that's you know that's where they picked it up and\nAnd Nielsen does what we do here is just as much as we kind of see what he's done over the years\nPlaying indoors in their dome how 'bout that are at six o'clock kick\nIt will be it's their dome was just like our don't it's a it's very similar and and um you know we're fortunate where inside with the ... where the weather's bad and I know they're getting snow up north and things right now that that's happening already so I think we're fortunate were inside a but yet there's there's there's going to be a sound factor to it because when you are inside much like our dome it doesn't take\nA full house to make it very loud in there and that and a full house and the competitive game at the place to place could really are up\nAnd they caught they've got some momentum they're one of two one beaten teams left in the lead there to an all along with North Dakota state so they go into the game feeling pretty good about where they sit at this juncture of the season\nYeah they've they've uh they've got a little bit of momentum like you said there to knowingly and er they beat Missouri state was a big went from last week that got that one at home and I who is the first one they\nAt southern Illinois oh they went to southern southern southern had has good football game to [noise]\nA deep sense of le they got a kid at a safety spot a Andrew Gray\nForce three turnovers this last week to bubbles and an interception was named the national deep and she player the week when you go into a a game and you you know a team has a guy like that that is just an outstanding thirtieth trying schemes things up to\nTo get away from him or do you just have to run your own ... and have your guys make plays no matter if they've got to a guy like Andrew Gray and that secondary howdy howdy approach that\nAnd where do you just have to run your ... and have your guys make plays no matter if they've got to a guy like Andrew Gray and that secondary howdy howdy approach that\nWell I think what you do is there's there's match up to out there you always look for the match up as much as you're going to run your office but there's ways to I mean we say window
