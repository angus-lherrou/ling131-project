I got the picture and immediately hurried off\nAnd um that was it and other people came up their picture taken with him and he was\nDidn't want it to happen seat Neil Armstrong was an engineer he didn't see themselves as a pilot and the furthest thing from the truth was a hero he taught for seven years at University of Cincinnati in the school of engineering and every student had him said he was a wonderful teacher a great professor very bright\nBut when you see the University of Cincinnati approach them do named the school of engineering then Neal a Armstrong school of engineering\nBut that makes sense but that makes sense that and then the school of engineering after Cincinnati zone Neil Armstrong the answer would be yes but Neal said absolutely not I don't want my name on buildings I don't want that and within a few months he left you see and what he did at that point\nWas simply serve on boards of directors had a farm and Warren County which is a county north of Cincinnati and you see 'em out now none of the fence but nobody would ever know that that was Neil Armstrong that was the man who walked on the moon because he never carried himself away in any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo in the movie comes out on friday you're going to see the actual real depiction of Neil Armstrong and how difficult it was to go to the moon and Nineteen sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance it would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement telling the American people that Neil Armstrong\nIn sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance he would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement telling the American people that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not make it\nAnd that there forever lost in space because that was the probability of what was going to happen the odds are going there and coming back and being successful in living was less than fifty fifty but Neal\nTook that risk in fact can limit other men took it over the next three years\nAnd we're not going back to the moon since [noise] let's continue with your call\nTo the topic that was a talk show hosts a privilege number to call his eight seven seven three one two three eighty one one\nTo see that movie it is a fabulous movie movie reminded me of the ten commandments counting on the great American shutting\nWe ask any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging to the conservative alternative to A.

T. though\nThat was something long sought by on Wednesday and others in the corn belt and the timing was hardly coincidental the move came yesterday morning allowing the president to take a victory lap at a rally in Council Bluffs last night\nBut if you think the fight is over gifts again\nFor months the White House has tried to balance the interests of agriculture with those of the oil industry oil wanted to be part of an agreement that this summer ban would be lifted and in exchange they get something they wanted from the administration\nThat didn't happen though and already the White House is scrambling to toss something to the oil patch folks to make up for the move on ethanol\nWe're like to thank the move to more ethanol\nThe White House is scrambling to toss something to the oil patch folks to make up for the move on ethanol\nWe hear like to thank the move to more ethanol is good policy but it also doesn't hurt Iowa's Republican candidates in the election only twenty seven days away\nKeep in mind some oil state senators like Ted Cruz of Texas or in tight races too and the president being able to deliver something for big oil before he does an upcoming rally for Cruz in taxes all that's on the short to do list\nSince ethanol is cheaper than gasoline the administration hopes to lower prices at the pump nationwide AAA says the average nationally is now two dollars Ninety One cents a gallon more than forty cents a gallon higher than this time of year ago\nThat's not something that helps incumbents when voters are thinking pocketbook issues\nThat sounds like the swamp give something to one side than something else to the other just to get votes and it is but\nIf the deadline of an election is what it takes to get policy in place that may help not only our farmers but folks nationwide we'd probably can go along with it and that's the Iowa politics report or Wednesday October town on Twitter and Instagram at Iowa politics I'm Jeff Stein on news talk\nUh

well no well you catch him I said okay how about sales manager have an appointment oh we can't see him either [laughter] I said well I'm not sure they are probably a little tear may have dropped out I don't know what I said can I Do you buy a vacuum cleaner\nAnd she shrugged his shoulders they go ahead and show I've plugged it in and I had that carpet cleaning and men as well and that didn't take her long she ran on the back and I came to the president sales manager and they saw this they said this is astounding this has been what's called my car sales\nWill you don't mind making a mailing to all of our dealers all over the country\nAre on this product and I said what I when I did and I got a tremendous return\nA and I thought wow this is the way to go so that like I got started mainly male to male all over the country and uh and even today a or a that's a very considerable percentage of its business by direct mail\nI Love it and then when you look back to struggling entrepreneur or anybody right now listening who's trying to break through business a little better looks the most important lesson that you could pull out of that in a true story what's the most important thing ...\nSays to my way of thinking I get that question of lecture to fix the universities right of students frequently asked the question I I think the important thing is you got to find one feature\nOn your product or service that you feel is particularly good or particularly unique and focus on that one thing if you're limited as to budget of course most businesses are and certainly get started\nAnd why by focusing on one thing you can bring more pressure to bear on the one of the pin and you can override chair for us so I concentrate on the fact that my Ike later Wade only eight pounds\nOr it has many other features but that's the thing I concentrated I won't people were tired of luck it around the heavy machine\nSure and you know I said well if you're in a weightlifting you only get one of those are the homeless and anyway I shall I say take one thing uh in particular and focus on it and I feel\nUh that that if I had to pick out one thing that would have to be the top of the list\nI Love it I Love it and my listeners know when I'm going to see you next or regular listeners when we met with Jack Welch I asked him what's the single most important attribute aside from\nA ethics to do in the right thing which is your foundation of business and life and I said what's the one most important thing he said differentiation of books even just told us the same thing there's consistency here common threads you're picking up the other thing David did he didn't take\nThe differentiation of bumps David orange just told us the same thing there's consistency here common threads of hope you're picking up the other thing David did\nHe didn't take no for an answer a no just meant another clever way to come up with the yes\nAnd he pulled off without an appointment a demonstration to the top brass that company and really help put them on the map when we get back we're going to find out more of the strategy and brilliance really on what David orcas accomplish in his life starting out with absolutely nothing I'm\nJohn Resnick and you're listening Tom legends of success and now some legendary advice from the margins success John ... from John Mitchell systems learn sill you're\nThe only difference I think once you have the opportunity that is between successful people and I'm the unbelievable successful people do all the things I'm successful people don't want to do whether it's a door slamming your face and you keep on going to the next door and the next door and the next door\nWas just as much as soon as she has missed the first white somebody doesn't work try it again and again for your janitor and I was just a few times in my life but I gleaned those lower so they told the guy says you can even when no one can\nLearn more from the legends mentions success dot com\nUsed to the two legends of success with John ... movie permission to Johns ... Lynch is not gonna learn so much is coming to get contact information listen to some lengths you boost\nMentions non coms\nWere back on much success were really honor to hammer ... he was with us and I believe in my first year when I was struggling to get more stations and um we really privileged to have\nDays an orange joined us down here we are up real hundred radio stations Davis back with us David or a gun the icon and the vacuum cleaner industry beyond ... cleaners David you some diversified a bit I Want to personally thank you and folks\nI never get paid by any guests to come on some time to time I do get a product\nWell David's office David sent me this air purifier Oric XL nice where do you I'm speaking of heart to heart with my listeners I Swear to you and I don't get paid for this guy\nI had a dry cough for the last couple of years anybody knows me so we always call and for now David when there was a coincidence or not I don't know that I put that XL air purifier in my office Mike office down Ninety percent and I just wanted to personally thank you my wife's thanks you\nAbout life there that the air I Know that breathing good air like breaking good water just makes sense and a way I Believe I air purifiers that's an excellent job of that\nWell the thing that surprises me is that when you take those filters out and you see how much ... I'm asking myself breathing\nOr that's the thing and people are of course for the New York you know what it is an electronic unit and uh you don't ever have to buy a new filter you just rented out at the sink and put it back and they will ask and they're like it's the same principle electrocuted Ira us submarine fleet\nWho obviously they can't\nA surface for fresh air all the time so uh this works electronically and we share as it comes to enter the filter that we have an opposite charge and ... and the shall we developed as it's called the Truman Show and we ah we've got about\nThirty a ... of fur patterns on that it's absolutely remarkable in this town\nHas reversed charge at it captures the last minute particles\nAnd are holes in a while to that challenge you rich with us to say if it does it does an outstanding job and uh\nI'm really proud of it has a lot of the features to it by the way after shoulders and it puts the growth of a bacteria you know back Terry Gross and multiplies itself several times every hour sure and uh we're both on our backyard fairs and an air purifier\nIn the manufacturing process we treat the product so the bacteria will not multiply when applied there and that's very important because as I say back to modify the south or are they like ten times every hour or something like that so and everything it's growth is very important\nWell and we do that both in the air purifier and on Iraq have cleaner\nI don't want to bring up a good timing for a point I wanted to make and I know we're jumping around a little and I'll get back to work on a logical story but\nI'm functional yesterday the talks about not only is another lesson to learn not only selling the product was selling the benefits I pull down a marketing press release you David this is very clever you not only um that I have found them straight man if I'm On you not only pick out the benefits but somehow you very cleverly\nTied it into a university professor and I have a press release some folks a study conducted by Dr Charles ... professor of environmental microbiology at University of Arizona in Tucson now what you does your David street now if I'm wrong is it not only you\nWind down the benefits of your product but then you go out and you seek the endorsement of people with high qualifications to help substantiate your product of a mind track you\nKnow that's that's correct and I think and not everybody believes there's someone selling something that they their objective is to salad which of course as true however and therefore they lie to sue correctly so I guess both cases that they're a little bit prejudice we try to get in a pet stores to corroborate\nWhat we know to be true but a coming from an independent sure that\nIt makes a big difference so well it's hard for today for ... for the verdict was who in the world who believe shore and uh I've found frankly that it's good business to tell the truth [laughter] that really helps\n... and it certainly doesn't hurt when you get a professor a doctor from Illinois it's extremely\nHelpful again corroborate her claim\nWell it was very very clever as well hats off to the Hey David give me a picture of how big work is today in this current year how big are you what kind of sales volume and how widespread today is your business\nWhere we can show all over the world and uh we have about a hundred or act for care centers in the U.S\nA couple of implies I Believe it's around Fifteen hundred and we make our product by the way in America I'm proud of that fact uh and uh\nBut everybody wanted one and\nThe question is do longer in business and Clinton was the first microwave oven and we were a wholesale distributors\nOf that product as well and um so I was really involved in a whole lot of the TV and appliance\nRadio and records sure not I would love to in the early stages of those things and I learned a great deal from them or one of the things that I think is so important than Los benefactors don't still don't understand that is if you don't control your distribution\nYou will be controlled by your distribution and that isn't necessarily and your best interest\nRepeat that for entrepreneurs and our business folks again would you please I'm\nSaying that if you do not control your distribution you will be controlled by your distribution and that will not be in your best interest of the long run\nSo give us an example David well what happened I hate\nTo be specific but uh if you do business with Wal Mart who's in charge right let's put it that way and uh I I I'm I'm not against Wal Mart or against anybody else for that matter I'm just saying this that\nBy controlling a distribution you can have a consistency for example in the case of war for care centers\nOf which there's oh probably six hundred of them around the U.S they fail or products they services or products they feature them they understand them they know exactly what it does what it doesn't do and they know our standards of are showing is if someone's not happy with our product they get their money back\nAs ... or buts about it in fact in most cases we don't selling the product until they take it home and try it and use it for a month or so and then say look if you're not entirely happy with this product\nYou'll return I get your money back you'll get a different whatever whatever makes you happy now if if I uh I couldn't impose those conditions on just the average retailer\nHa look you buy it's off the shelf if they'd service will call somebody else I'm not interested in that you know if you buy something from some of these big box discounters who you talk to the cashier if you'll have a problem\nSure how I met a without getting into a lot of details are having control of your distribution to have a consistency\nThat fits in with your product we guarantee our products longer than any of our competitors but we have to have a retailers and other folks said that uh the fulfill that policy\nSure not though again I said that if you don't control your distribution you will be controlled by or distribution and that may not be in your best interests\nAnd we get back from this break we're going to find out how David opened up his first retail center is Bruce distribution location um it wasn't an easy rude and it was no plans road but it's amazing how to receive them opportunity\nRuining the legend six John Resnick David ... we'll be right back\nThe engines on a new beginning of our business\nToday with David Boring I tell you here's the men that you're a lot of wisdom along a real true and it does he's been through and he just tells you how did it and how we thought and how we got a problem\nEven going back to you you moved to New York city when you got out of the military you got involved with the the really the largest or see a wholesale distributor in America\nUm and then you work for Seventeen years you build a product dumped fast tracking little you build up a product that nobody can make successful\nAnd then it was yanked from you tell me that story would ya\nWell uh yeah I after Seventeen years I decided I Would leave they discovered a shift I was forty years of age so I guess it's never too late to start something new sure and that and I took on this product which frankly had been developed\nBy world pool uh originally and they say on a ladder and that is it just doesn't challenge then they was a lot of problems with it as well I have to say and truth that that that worked on different principle and so uh well I found them so\nThat I could make a success of that product or I felt like a correct the things that why it didn't work well and so on and uh and so I took it as I was friendly with the president of whirlpool at the time so that that doesn't hurt anything to\nBe able to make an arrangement with them on that product\nAnyway we took that we've modified it made changes significant changes that made it work without changing the fundamental behind it sure and so\nAgain I guess being tenacious and that split the element of good luck that doesn't hurt or along the way I've often said given the choice between black and skill we'll take a look every now and uh anyway uh that's how I got it going\nAnd of course we correct as the problems with it so that it worked extremely well without sacrificing the fact that it wait only eight pounds\nThis is the vacuum cleaner of course\nYeah the good thing about the Oric vacuum is it ... in the air and almost all of these bags vacuum cleaners that you read about here or are they will ... the air last year and a ... a very bad thing is to die\nBut you build that long enough to be very successful with the blessings of the president's for world will correct\nThat is correct and a Bush has another long story that they don't want to get into but ah at that time a Sears, Roebuck was a principal principle customer of whirl pools making under their own brand name and the president of shares was then the board of world pool\nAnd uh we did so well with that product that have suggested\nAs a matter of court records show of saying it would hit that tiny suggested ... do well to get along without me [laughter] well they they like ... ... they looked upon me and I was just nothing a as a a potential threat\nWell uh anyway uh but you know some kind of bad things that turn out to be good\nYou David you took a product that nobody else could sell you were the top salesperson product that's how you got the line with world that is\nThat is absolutely true and I was a that was true anyway of bad things happen but sometimes for the good because uh we lost our arrangement was world pool as a and uh\nWe went on to do it ourselves people off and said why do you call it an ... every other day and that I tried to copyright was taken step mind and [laughter] and ah so anyway uh\nIt was a little bad luck that really made me do the things I had to do and it turned out to be very good uh it's really good to do things for yourself if you can sure and that was one of the things that are that's what got us going\nWell and I've always said on this David street me out or or you know correct in the mall here somewhere but with every ...\nEvery ... seat of opportunity no matter how bad you think you've got you you got nailed there is a seat of opportunity there waiting to be turned around them and make the difference in your life and is greater than the fact that you that\nWay you know I I don't remember who said originally but they said that every or a pessimist by definition as someone who sees a problem and every opportunity an optimist as someone who sees an opportunity and every problem and\nA and I think that's very true I I really do\nThe that's will will will you took this product and are you um ended up getting your own uh distributorship correct well\nWe yeah we took the product and then we ended up doing our own manufacturing and or so on and really have a beautiful plant today up in Tennessee and and uh\nSo it it it ... at that time and so on but it was very very good thing I think one of the problems that I said today is at the end we mentioned that little earlier today is that there's so many very successful companies\nWho in the past fifty years of disappeared what happened to Montgomery Ward would have the international high risk or what happened to Westinghouse when that happened to\nHis Venus or what happened to have our share a and so on and I honestly believe that a certain arrogance that comes with success\nOr as the fact that the entrepreneur was pushed aside in favor of the business manager from you know a movie star as a business manager but where would the manager here because he didn't have the star\nAnd so um I I think that's a\nVery important and I think losing contact with the consumer today for example\nSomeone who can get on the Web and uh get Oric W. W. W. dot com and we send them the product it doesn't cost anything we pay for the delivery to begin with like you have for their travel we take it back and pay for the pick up if they are not satisfied\nWe bend over backwards to see to it the customer is absolutely happy well doesn't that make sense when you think about it to make your customer happy\nDays you'll have cells reluctance to you [laughter] this is great I mean you were ... again ... you're learning from one of the best\nThey can tell a great story continue to market his products I'm not putting that down I'm complimenting not because\nThink of how I feel like studying too liberal for\nIowa and why don't we know without rotten lung we know von ... is pro life and endorsed by national right to life and the at All right\nHas earned the support the Iowa fund zero in the Iowa renewable fuels association rod\nIs working to bring in the Washington swamp by pushing for congressional term with ... the cuts for Congress we know rod\nNose hard fouls rods\nFrom being paid for by blood for Congress\n[noise] the voice of eastern Iowa\nOn to the movie KFC\nNeither one of the biggest storms and one of the biggest sell off ever on the ...\nThe Dow dropped more than eight hundred points mainly fueled by rising interest rates the NASDAQ plunging more than four percent it's take his point drop in Eighteen years more on the mark\n\nAnd as far as that central pressure goes how low the pressure in the center of the storm what that is the third strongest storm the third lowest pressure we've ever recorded of land falling storm here are across the U.S\nFox meteorologist Rick ... years tens of thousands without power in Florida as a hurricane bearing down now in the Alabama Georgia Line heading north east to area still recovering from Hurricane Florence\nI really worry a little bit about South Carolina North Carolina from the standpoint Rory saturated fat and getting that reasonable head as president\nTrump monitoring the storm and the financial markets one of the worst days ever on Wall street third largest point drops for about the gal and asked at the White House says it'll pass\nI just get off the phone with a senior White house official told me that are in the feeling around the White House here is that this is a ball market correction [noise] it's nothing to panic about and in fact it's probably a good thing or the market might have been a little bit overheated there are some concerns\nAbout rising interest rates however this person told me that are those concerns are probably over ...

forty or toll free eight hundred five eight four Seventy\n[noise] sure well from home and coming up from the homecoming standpoint we know that that's the game that's always a well attended in comparison to out of the games I and so we're looking forward to having a good crowd we're having a a four o'clock kickoff\nOr for that particular game uh so we feel like that's going to give everybody an opportunity to be able to come and do the necessary uh tailgating but they would like to do before the game\nAnd then be able to come in and enjoy themselves are obviously hoping for great weather we hadn't had much luck with that the first couple of games\nOr we've had to close the grass lot so we're hoping that that will be available and with that we're hoping that we'll be able to have had fans own a up and running a before the game so people will be able to take advantage of that\nUh for the first time this year so that'll be a great situation for us as well or from a promotion standpoint I you know we have a talked at length about the different ticketing options I bet you have available so\nUh whether it's a season ticket or a single game tickets bills obviously available but uh we've also introduce that many ... that many pack\nA flex plan I and the mobile pass option or each of which is a little bit different and each of which kinda occupies that space between a single game by air and a season ticket holder either giving you a certain number of tickets that you can use whatever you'd like\nOr allowing you to purchase just a smaller number of games that are reduced price\nOr giving you a season ticket that obviously operates off with your mobile phone I'm twenty four hours before the game then you have an opportunity to be able to ah see where your seats are going to be a sort of those things are in play here as we go for it to the for the rest of the season ah we're looking pretty aggressively\nOr at how we're going to make sure that there is\nA as much awareness as we can possibly have that the game is happening but the thing that we're doing a town or if you notice here last week uh we had billboards digital billboards of talking about political to state game uh so we're going to be continuing to do that\nUh we use social media a great deal could be if the word out or to make sure that people aware of it so uh we're going to do everything that we possibly can to market his game and make it a a a great environment we have the number two team in the country coming in\nA so we want to make sure that we're getting in front of the students are and also talking about it as much as we can't last week\nI you know we went on the um went on TV with a K W W O and talked about uh the game and did an interview and so if they're open to doing something like that that we want to do that or certainly it in as well so we're hoping that people will understand how\nMuch of a role that they play in helping us or be able to win the games are and that they will respond to having a great opponents come into a the dome and give us a chance to really get back\nOr to having the kind of dominant home field advantage that I think everybody wants to be able to see\nDavid Harris director of athletics at the University of northern Iowa honor Billie Jean VIP hotline kicking off a Wednesday edition\nOf old PR and you're right that that usually that homecoming game you always have a\nA great crowd in ... the little bit is on the football team too they do get a win this weekend and maybe that casual or marginal than are they in this trying to decide am I going to go to that game when they're at home on homecoming with South Dakota state you know\nChalk it up a big road when maybe all helping excite them too so they they go out and do their uh\nTheir deal this weekend certainly will help the volleyball team is often just a tremendous start after a dropping their final non conference match of the regular season to tenth right crate and they rattled off seven straight valley wins a Bobby Peterson and ... ball team is a really off to a great start in league play David\nThey off to great story that I think you know if you talk Bobby she would tell you this is the reason\nThat we play the kind of non conference schedule that we place so that we can get off the strong source in a conference and we certainly done that this year it's been great watching those student athletes have success watching as when games will be just at home than what you had games on friday and Saturday at length date\nWhere you've got a chance to see us play two of three a top teams in the league and be able to win those\nGames pretty convincingly so Bobby continues to rage out to everybody expects you to do and we just look forward to continuing to support the team throughout the rest of the year uh sometimes in a in all of the conversation or bad happens around football and the football attendance and\nUh things that we know are important\nUh it's also important that we support sports like volleyball that have just such a tremendously rich history of success on the court and off the court and so I don't uh\nDon't ignore the fact that ... team is doing great things that it's a great experience to be able to come to the volleyball game but it's fun\nOf the games move pretty rapidly we have great student athletes at great coaching a were playing against good opponent and it's just great to be able to come that support the program as they continue to move forward and uh having a great season is especially having a great conference season\nAnd we look forward to just continuing this ride week to week we play a challenging schedule but we look forward to going forward and having the very best season that we've had\nYeah and and you and I ... I think it last time I look was like top\nTop ten top twelve in the nation in staying attendance\nBut there's still room for more but the jump on the the paint the violence but yeah it looks if that's right well one thing we haven't really talked much uh of late with you is the panther scholarship club what's the latest with that PFC and how's everything going there and all that's an important part of the\nOf the athletic department and and um [noise] things that you want to get done for the student athletes at you when I\nWrite a cash donations are just send a one point for\nFive million so uh where are we in a position to have a we already on the spot where we have the second highest a cash donations or that we've ever had behind last year when we finish with a record All right one point five two so\nUh we're happy about where things stand but we know that we used to work to do our oldest one point six billion or so we're right around two hundred thousand dollars away from Michael a with a two and a half months left in the years so uh it's something that we're pushing significantly\nTwo hundred thousand dollars away from our goal a with a two and a half months left in the years so uh it's something that we're pushing significantly we've kicked off just a couple of days ago uh Fifteen days with giving here in the month of October for those who are joining\nOver in New England to PFC or if they do that and they entered into a drawing\nOf it gives them an opportunity to be able to win some pretty great prizes and I sold for those who haven't\nGotten their membership who have a renewed or thinking about making the delegation of this is a great time to do it over the next couple of weeks because it gives you an opportunity to be able to get some things that made it gives you access to a game or give you access to some of our coach is with us launches dinners or\nOr things on the sidelines or whatever it is still a take a look at that it's on our website you can see all the things that are listed all the opportunities that are out there\nAre just really support the pay if a scholarship club but money is drip is very important to help us to achieve our goals with our student athletes being able to fund those scholarships\nAre big picture goal as a part of our strategic plan is to get to two million dollars and so getting to one point six by is the next step in that or to be able to make that happen so we look forward to people continuing\nTo support the club this year to reaching that goal but we know we still have some work to do and we're going to continue to push that forward as hard as we chat\nYeah a lot of people doing great work or on behalf of the paint their scholarship club keep it up and now that goal is in sight now David it's insight you you can get there before we let you go is there anything else are we just we got a couple of minutes left anything else that you want to share with our listening audience today concerning you and I paint the athletics that maybe we haven't touched down recently\n[noise] well I Would I Would just say this I'm actually a Chicago here today we're having a lump having an alumni function or here in Chicago just to\nTalk with the Panthers fans we get a chance to do this from time to time and different places across the country and we just have phenomenal people uh we have great people that\nWe are all very appreciative to\nA source of support that they give us so whether we're going to Florida Arizona too over to Omaha up to the twin cities to Kansas City come and the Chicago wherever it is that we go we get a great response we did an event or out in Colorado out in Denver a couple of months ago\nSo the alumni association does a great job of putting on these events\nAnd I'm always happy to be able to come and the president will be here and\nAnd we'll be talking about a University in and giving people hear an update I think we have over a hundred people that are registered to be the

talk Fifteen forty KFC out\nYou're listening to on press row and do a great job news talk Fifteen forty chaos to the ah [noise]\n\nI'll come back to a Wednesday edition of on press role with the sports guy I'm Gary rhyme alongside our in Studio producer and co host\nChris do even after the birth the boy the sports should joining us live in Studio on our Wednesday Waterloo Black Hawk segment is Tim Harwood front office staff and the play by play voice of Waterloo Black Hawk hockey home and away\nCovers it all for the Blackhawks Tim welcome to the show how are you\nWhile I'm doing good but not nearly as good as Chris happy birthday Chris\nThey kicked him I really appreciate it and actually Twenty one today yeah I'm I'm only Twenty one boy so guy legal you know believe it or not I went to high be you know to pick up an adult beverage and who didn't get id me so what's what's really the point of having an idea and we'd be honest and that is\nWhat always happens that come on ... but but seriously sports guy I mean he is weak is over today that said that this is the end\nYeah that's right I Will get nothing out of him the rest of the week I I gotta feeling of that a\nBlack Hawk tacky talk about what happened this past weekend I thought it was interesting first of all that you had to go to Des Moines employee or in state rival buccaneers on friday night then jump back on the bus and make the truck back across the state of Iowa into Illinois that take on central Illinois on Saturday\nYeah you know it was challenging but at the same time it was not nearly the bus trip we had the weekend before when I was in Pittsburgh for the usa gel fall classic those games counted this year so there was some extra\nExtra emphasis on having a good showing and the two weekends were very similar in in a lot of ways uh especially in that the team came away with three of the four possible standings points from the two games both weekends\nThe game goes to overtime doesn't come out the way the clocks would hope for but you still get the point to show for it in the standings and then maybe most impressive lay the follow up the next night to come back and get the when\nAfter in in the case of the fall classic friday you know the auction worked really hard to get back into a game where they were down big go into the third period a\nAnd and you have a game that ultimately killed the other way and over time it it can be a tough one to bounce back from but they did it\nThat weekend and then this weekend in the morning it was the buccaneers who came back to ... they got the game chipped in their favor in a shootout and so that's hard to come back from two right you know you don't lose you don't lead in regulation or you don't trail and regulation I should say and you don't come out with the wind either\nAnd and that's that can be tough for a young team but then to come back the next night with a pretty good I've to one went against the central Illinois flying aces yeah that's that's a pretty good start\nLooks like we need to just tell this black hawks team that every period is the third period there are there ... there at least early on strong finishing team really out score and their opponent in that third period so far you just for games into it but third period it's been pretty good to the black ...\nYes it's a the the only game was the friday him against and one last week and that's the only time they'd been out scored by an opponent in the third it's a very small sample size still but uh\nI I think that does give you some things that you might be able to say it's certainly a team that can skate and that's in pretty good shape early on to\nYou know be able to do the full sixty minutes and either in the case of the game this most recent Saturday pull away or if we go back to that first game\nAre back on September the twenty eight you know they still have the legs to make a pretty precise we'll come back down four to one go into the third of that night so yeah I I think that there's a lot of promises a lot of good science\nIt's it's a really early to make a lot of big generalizations are wide ranging statements but there's there's a lot to be positive about after four games Tim\nHarwood the play by play voice of the Waterloo black hawks radio network on her village in VIP microphone today on a Wednesday edition of OPM as you mentioned small sample size but the Blackhawks four games into this new season\nHaven't lost the game in regulation just one of two teams in the western conference that can say that\nYeah the the tri city storm have one fewer gain that they've played their perfect three you know but uh yeah I I think the early indications are that ah there's there's no reason to expect things won't be very close very tight again much like they were last year with a you know a pack of teams that kind of moving together in the standings I\nI'm not sure I see a situation where someone's going to reel off\nTen straight wins and even if they do I I'm not sure that that's going to be enough for them to really pull away from the other teams in the conference the way things have started and really the way things have gone over the last couple of years you know you haven't seen those those run away\nConference champions at you know last year was a great example in the springtime when it went down to the final day that black collects got a little bit of help that last weekend way back in April when the national team development program last their last game and then didn't play on the final night of the seasons for the hawks had the chance to move past them but\nThere was no guarantee and\nThere was no guarantee even for the national team development program either because almost right there in the answers were only a point back when it was all said and done so they could have gotten into the mix too with the right set of circumstances on that last day of the regular season I I really think that there's no reason to expect that it will be much different this year\nTo him I Can't help but it's the same way let's have some chaos like you think and and you know I couldn't help but notice obviously Saturday is the home opener but I saw on Twitter that there's a possibility for fans to win a luxury suite for Saturday's game\nThat I knew it was a possibility I I uh I'm not sure if that's been awarded yet or not though so I I guess the only way you're going to whether\nYour birthday I might as well and you know roll the dice gifts of good luck\nI Would encourage you to check out Twitter and I bet there are more details there than ah than what I've got I I Am not the the fastest down the drawl when it comes to the uh the Twitter machine at\nA set of problems with the whole law for and that's a big deal there's going to be a lot of events going on with that what I was going to take place Tim\nWhat's the uh Anderson kept celebration so that the plaque clocks one of the regular season title last year best record in the United states hockey league and so that's always a cause for celebration you get the chance to\nBring out the Andersen ... banner will be the first time that fans will get the chance to see that will have a special ceremony before the game to recognize last year's accomplishment\nAnd you can take a in a sense a little bit of ...\nAnd so we get the chance to see that will have a special ceremony before the game to recognize last year's complement and you can take a in a sense a little bit of at home with you because the first thousand fans and attendance will receive a commemorative twenty Seventeen Eighteen Anderson cup champions penance\nSo that's kind of a nice way to remember what happened in can attack that up on the wall around the court order wherever you'll see it and think ah you know I was I was part of that I was at some of those games it's also\nBud Light opening night and we yeah we have the variants spelling there cayenne I.

yards I mean ... or Russia's I think a dozen times for eighty one yards and you're you're running ... not once a it looked like they got\nThey got negative yard each on a carry that's that's got to be a pretty satisfying to to the to the staff to see your running backs do that\nWithout question you know and they all ran a heart attack blowing the screws but uh you know I I tell you what are you know I'll take my hat off the hook you up in July and a lot of Saturday they came off the ball and you know they control the line of scrimmage and uh you know uh that helps when they're not getting not touched in the backfield\nCoach Gary mentioned it you had six players over twenty four yards rushing an average five and a half yards per carry that has to mean that that young often of lines really coming along nicely\nFurther they're playing well they they really are you know we we we don't know the junior senior honor and they're all it's stable outlines stable they're all they're all

job to use a consistent and working hard and uh uh you know he he has its ups and downs in practice is once in a while but it to what\nHe's he's one of those guys that are just the same motor all the time it does it doesn't change doesn't get high and low at a a you know and if something doesn't work required re one day he ...\nYou don't have the problem the next day and er [noise] you know that they're pretty pressure for a young boy\nWhat what's his story was was he uh was he a high school kicked her was he a walk on was the U.S soccer player that said hey I Want to give this football thing is shot what what's Jonathan Herrera story\nA Jonathan is probably going to get the wrong school but he's you know he's a high school kicker from a a divine a device that okay\nAt the moment yeah yeah

TV I reports that the mother as is identified as Jane Doe and the lawsuit against lot la du Horton Watkins high school will do officials said a friday that a junior who doesn't make the varsity team cannot return to the junior varsity team\nAccording to the lawsuit this amounts to age and sexual discrimination because of the same rules don't apply to younger students or the girls the family sued after la du superintendent Donna\nJunkie decided the family's complaint was unsubstantiated in court room testimony a friday\nThe head coach David Aaron burgee said the seven juniors cut from the varsity team weren't even good enough for the JV team either so coaches this but so then I I I come across this article ah and I thought this was really good it was written by Dr her ready yet Dr\nKristin her ready yeah who lives in Ottawa and uh I I just thought I thought this was really good for for maybe parents to hear this student athletes to absorb this here's what she writes\nI recently attended a sporting event when I witnessed a father talking to his distraught daughter\nThe daughter was not currently getting as much playing time as are teammates and she was very visibly upset about this instead of going in complaining to all the parents in the bleachers are going to the coach to complain the father asked his daughter these questions\nWhen was the last time you've been to the gym to work on your skills have you been working in the weight room have you had a good added to\nHave you been working like a team player\nShe could not answer these questions for her father he then responded to her this is one person's problem yours you need to make it so that they have no choice but to leave you in because you are that good and valuable to the team\n... the writer of this article went on to write I Want to give kudos to this parent for putting the responsibility back on his daughter and making it a life lesson\nHe did not handled this all too common situation by engaging in the whispering bleacher banner or yelling profanity ... at the coach throughout the game this father chose to put responsibility on his daughter\nTo make her realized that she needed to improve performance and her attitude if she wanted to increase or playing time\nBy the time kids reach the junior high level the idea of equal playing time should not be seen as a requirement\nLower level activities require equal playing time enforce no cut policies and do a great job it allowing kids to hone their skills\nAnd to try new roles positions et cetera so they can find their strengths by the time kids reach junior high they are competing for larger goals and they are preparing for high school level competition\nNot everyone is going to get equal playing time not everyone is going to get an a on his or her test not everyone is going to get the same amount of stage time not everyone can be first chair in the band\nNot everyone is going to be a starter\nPeople are in these things by their performance when you were on a competitive team of any kind you have to realize you are competing you are competing not only as a teen but also you are competing for specific spots enrolls this is not a bad thing\nThis is it time to find strengths and weaknesses\nIs a time defined likes\nAnd dislikes it is it time to learn life's lessons we cannot expect everyone to have the resilience of Rudy Rucker but an attitude like his paired with hard work listening to coaches showing up to perform and displaying good character and teamwork can benefit of player as well as the whole team\nUnfortunately even with hard work and great attitude some kids just aren't cut out for certain activities me for example I'm never going to be a performance singer no matter how much I practice\nOr how many voice lessons I pay for I Am never going to be a good singer even if I got a spot on the choir I Would no I Would never be a soloist we all must understand our capabilities\nParents need to help their children by setting a good example of sportsmanship instead of instilling entitlement if you join a competitive activity and you are not able to honorably ride the roller coaster of emotions then maybe competitive activities\nAre not one of your strength good article I think by Dr Christina or a Christian\nHer ready yet a ... it's it's a problem and I go back to the first story about the mother suing a high school because her son get cut from the varsity soccer\nIt's a problem and I go back to the first story about the mother suing a high school because her son get cut from the varsity soccer team instead of sitting or sundown and say hey\nHow how much time if you spent working on your your game of soccer how much time if you worked on your conditioning did you take a good attitude did you work hard if these players are better than you what do you have to do\nTo get better to possibly make the team down the road and said that you know ... and ... and she makes such a great this is something that I I'm telling you I really\nI really related to this article by this doctor because this is the kind of things that I\nI preach to my three sons and my daughter when when they were growing up and they were involved in it didn't matter if it was sporting events if it was the school will play whatever I mean not everybody can be the lead in the school play you might try out for and you get cut\nSo you can't sue because you didn't get the lead in the school play right into the the coach decides you're not going to be one of his starting players on his on his sports team whatever the team\nThen I I always told my kids the approach you gotta take is go in and sit down with the coach and say hey coach what do I have to do\nTo to to get more playing time to to be more part of the team where my week where am I lacking what do I have to improve on instead of going in and just complaining about hey I Want to play more
