want to try to be honest candid open it up here to come here to let you got\nTo get some things I Can't think of it like the way they were doing in Donald Trump under the back and back in that but on the Internet all he had been in the public I thought all these years and not one habit they called in those nasty and they got to run against Hillary Clinton\nWell certainly there was a shall we say a major turnaround in it and when they want when he won\nThen obviously that has something to the major sector of this country has not come to terms with they cannot accept that he won make him out except that he signs bills into law they cannot accept the dictates national policy accordance with the\nThe constitution of this was a major problem for a minute it's been now two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in it yeah he really did win\nOr even with all the copper Schmidt look at what he's two years have gotten more and Obama could win a year and they don't like that than President Trump is the\nCo pilot neither businessman I always say if they want to know what's going on with the body look at the hands of the body of people are going to look at the day [noise]\n[noise] well there's no question about the fact that he's a certainly had a major impact and I'm Wondering how you you got to be connected with his campaign I mean obviously there are a lot of people out there who\nWho are rallied to his his support but not many people have gotten to actually speak at a at a rally is held up for a candidate Trump but and then President Trump how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nAnd the body and they kept it out and he came in North Carolina there was no way they were going to be in North Carolina we not be there\nOh cool [laughter] um and it does it go from there he came in North Carolina there was no way they were going to be here in North Carolina we not be there so it was a right for us to be at one of his rallies\nInvited on stage in my we didn't have to take his bike he gave it to us to let us say whatever we wanted to say for all of those cameras back there to back it was it was probably over a hundred of them\nAnd I'm Out there that that was that was just it just snowballs out there that I think that next worry and Mississippi opening up for a rally and we've opened up for so many of them yeah um it I just can't column and\nThey didn't plan it we didn't wait we didn't have to wait to any body weight it's always been like that it's just everything don't bother to old\nAnd I really think about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time he is about the people he or the people real people\nUm he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct Donald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president\nI mean he ... he looked at who we hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire even\nThough he is a billionaire he just couldn't act out any I don't get about yeah I hear what the people and people say and he won because hey us go ahead say oh\nYes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now and his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to the people nobody saw him he's not beholden to\nHollywood or the lobbyists nobody bought him a paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in office\nAdd a lot at all and look at the left wing media how they spend ... gossip stories and they only mayor who they fear they fear him because they know he went and they don't try to stop the losers but they will try and stop a winner\nAnd now they they certainly are they object you may you of course now to where you are women you are African American and oh that really sets off the the far left crowd because you people have minds of your own and you're not doing what you're told to do and\nThey didn't anticipate that they will\nCome along a diamond in it and pay that people will start speaking out like God you know they wanted to\nHear or contain all the good thing to get three as thinking on the inside of the box you did not say nothing it remember now because Obama did back in the day I'm a gay people\nStill staff that Obama can create economic opportunity for people how they would want to end up with about that\nAnd the puppet masters will have to look at the day out of the leaders are so upset with down but the Trump President Trump because hey it up into those elite is he in the

other coaches didn't want to have a an animal shelter that had been there and and where we where we common sense that\nHad as you've noted we had club teams and women have competed in sports but certainly not at the same level as men what is different and important there for for the female student athlete of today to hear from some of these individuals whether it was from Twenty years ago were fifty years ago\nAnd the anniversary of the fiftieth anniversary predate title nine\nAnd I think we tend to think of title nine as being the jump off plant where things changed things have become better and that really here at you and I it was prior to that and I think when you when I've spoken with these ladies\nAbout their experience that they at the time just wanted to participate they were looking for opportunities\nUm to play the sport they lab they grew up\nIn some having family that where's the port in those girls and women athletics and for others not so much or maybe in communities that we're not as an\nInclusive and providing those opportunities are girls and women\nFor our current student athletes to hear from them hear the story the other experiences how things have grown from\nYou know the interesting looking uniforms or the low budget or maybe non scholarships to where we are today they really take that information and appreciate just how far we've come on you know our ... based off of that long history as\nStrong women competing competing at a variety of different levels and the sport they live and religion growing up individual here at the University of Northern Ireland\nAnd it has to be massively gratifying for these women who\nI Would say put up with an awful lot of those earliest days whether it was unfair budgets unfair uh facilities uh inequalities and and probably things much worse than that but to be able to see where things are today again must be very gratifying for that\nYeah that ... from all of them that I've spoken with their very appreciative of the fact that we are honoring them and celebrating them that year\nAh where we can where we can do as much as we can do to celebrate it and to promote everything that they've done an accomplished on I I Know that they're very grateful they many of them that I've spoken with are very happy that we are getting that for you know and and celebration all year round\nI'm of a certain age it's no secret the audience knows I'm fifty five and so as the people my age we're going through it was maybe fifth or sixth grade when all of a sudden wow now we have girls' basketball\nIf the K. twelve level because again of title nine and the need for equality not just because it was a good idea but so some of us have grown up with it in other words\nAnd so we may be diluted into thinking while every single and everything's equal there there are no problems but my sense is that there is still an uphill climb\nFor women in athletics even after this level is that fair\nThat is a fair statement I it's an unfortunate faint and I know we do still have some work to do and we have done a lot on me in the course of the time that we don't have much more we can deal where institutions are always looking at participation opportunities um looking\nI'm In the course of the time that we do have much more we can deal where institutions are always looking at participation opportunities I'm looking at it you know equal treatment in treatment and being all the items to\nThe the ... uh caliber of facilities are practicing and competing and the their travel arrangements there\nUm facilities in academics that they have acceptable to them all those different elements um I came to this institution a little bit over two years ago I'm very happy with where I came into the um and it's a it's a real family atmosphere and I think\nVery open and very inclusive environment and we're we definitely um you know are looking for equity and continue to maintain equity and moving forward and to grow the programs that we have\nBut in in terms of collegiate athletics across the board it is it's something that we have to continue to work at not every institution as fortunate as we are\nAnd I hate asking for comparison because again each individual campus is distinctive and therefore unique but\nBased on your experience can you point how things are done at un I into context either with regard to peer institutions places you than other regions institutions and and I mentioned to you before we came on\nPeople in our state I've lived here my whole life we always think of Iowa Iowa State and you went on it because they are the three regions institutions but they're not equal in terms of size or budget or facilities that we expect the Panthers to compete with those other people and so give me a sense of how you and I stacks up compared to some of these other metrics\nI think we pride ourselves and doing a lot and being able to be competitive and successful and all areas of our student athletes live I'm being successful at the bigger programs you're right we don't have the budget um that that some of those other institutions have those two institutions within our state\nUm that we'd practiced stuff in the fact that we do a lot with sometimes a little\nWhile and when you know going in\nYou know with the enrollment is you know what the

commemorations or or they're smaller events throughout the year that we should pay no to\nWell I Would say next week to keep your eyes and ears open and we will be announcing the fiftieth anniversary team\nI it was too difficult to narrow down to fifty women Theo season many more than that on that but I I won't mention names ruined the surprise\nI'm dead in January January nineteenth we will be hosting the and go when a player that\nAnd having several women can back to be on a panel of speakers to bake at that event and we do live inside of an auction as we do every year it in order to raise funds for two women at play scholarship so look out for that I Believe registration roll began for women at play on November\nFirst um but then the other thing that I wanted to mention while on the air is that you may have noticed that new banners we have for volleyball and the fact that goes with it in the cloud\nThe new banners we decided to put in in order to create a at a more prominent look I'm In in the cloud and I think I think we did for a good job\nUm but all of the former banners that we pulled down we had them currently on auction as though if anyone wants to download the handed app off the app store Google place or\nThey can take a look at those the auction will end on September ... I'm Sorry and on Sunday October twenty eighth that eight pm central\nTime and you can go on there that now the sweet sixteen hours per volleyball will be the there's three of them they will be auctioned off at a rally in the valley\nThis coming year um and then the men stock about the men are we'll wait and option that went off at at I'm In the twenty twenty rally in the valley in order to celebrate the ten ten year anniversary of that\nBand I know last year during the ah athletics seasons new banners were put up to recognize the few very distinctive and special coaches and so this is part of the overall\nFacelift if you will with regard to what's hanging to be very prominent and and to give each of those special teams even more of a prominent place\nYeah exactly um so at some point we'll be looking at our other venue as well\nAnd so this is a chance for fans for whether it is for the uh\nI don't know I think man gave us a sexist or but for the police at home or you're watching the sports if you're a fan and you'd like to have one of these banners all you have to do was bid very few have been separated to be as you mentioned to be auctioned off at a different time\nAnd you've got just a little more than a week week from Sunday night is the deadline reminders again if someone wants to bid on one of these championship banners that used to literally hanging the McLeod setter what should they do\nDownload the hand fed at a you can download it on their iPhone app store or the Google Play store or at once you're in hand that you can register and then you'll be able to take a look at bill actually the pictures of what the bad guys look like and\nFor those who either may not recall but was there was standardization to the men's basketball versus the women's basketball versus the volleyball banners or did each of these three sports have some separate distinctive Mr where there was not uniformity\nThey were uniform but in the way they or categorize was by year so that's an accomplishment ... regular season champions but trying to make champion that might appear on the single banner that one year\nNow the bigger more prominent banners now have a new category though if the team made it to the tournament 'em sit in the tournament that there's and the a banner if they were tournaments NBC tournament champion there is a ban are for that and we can just continue to add years as they came back\nAnd to some degree it really helps because when you see the cumulative nature things maybe it's the domination of the conference in a in a certain sport or the number of NC double a tournament appearances they're All right there and it and to me it's even more impactful because it shows the history as opposed to a lot of different banners\nAnd the connection with I. S. T. C. again was strong because of Joe ... backgrounds and having attended\nBut there were some really important pivotal figures here at the time such as professor her hey\nYeah exactly still on the way we think about him now we really think of her ... as sort of the pioneer and broadcasting history on hate us all up in the nation and he was tapped to be the radio director um he was in a different department and then when president price wanted to start this radio station\nOn she moved her make over and he did a tirade programming he taught different classes about radio and technology to the students\nUm and then later um he went on to have a television program on just that aired for many many years\nAnd many could remember and this was connected with the Iowa State university television station at the time channel five and I was educational he withdraw things and and it was it was a great appeal about Iowa history as I recall\nYeah the ... and marks in Iowa history um and he was really known for doing these cartoons he was sort of give a history lesson and draw on different doodles along the way and then at the end of his boss and that you had sort of turned into some sort of really cool image that depicted but he was trying to convey\nThere's just a little bit of something here and something here and you can't possibly say see how he's been going to be connected and by the very end it is something that that is is really a masterpiece\nAnd again that dates back to the Nineteen fifties into the early Nineteen sixties those broadcast again from the very first day ... was on the air there were live broadcast from what is now the University of northern Iowa campus from this building weighing hall which\nUnder went to a massive remodeling and transformation I Want to say a decade ago but I think it's a little longer than that and so we're in the place where these broadcast took place even though the actual facility is a is not here [noise]\nThere was a story that the folks found about how the broadcasts abruptly ended tell me about that one because uh I thought that was a fascinating story\nUm I don't know the details on that but I Know it was in Nineteen forty eight and they were basically just some issues between um personally know people who were on there just ideas about on the kinds of concepts that they wanted to have broadcast and I think Joe demanding on President price didn't quite see eye to eye on that\nAs I was looking at the material that you folks found and it was from the newspaper at the time I think what happened this is the shorthand of it is that one of ... employees left and then started pitching programs to un I lessons working over here and do mine didn't want to hear that man's voice on his radio station and pull the plug wins you\nFrom the whole history wouldn't be as a shock either and it was a unique situation because the university actually\nPaid for some of the air time and then got some of the donations from their along\n[laughter] yeah that's right as I think they had this sort of regular on the half hour program for free and then on top of that they paid\nThe the you mentioned the athletics and again we have to put things into contracts for folks Nineteen forty two was Seventy six years ago but broadcasting had only been around for about twenty twenty five years at that point and so the very first radio play by play\nCreates Gary ... I Know we have a hard time thinking there was anybody before Gary rhyme a but\nThat is what as an experimental broadcast was done on K exhale and they would hear these broadcasts alarms could across the country mhm yeah that's a powerful and and that is the case now of course as well what else about this relationship between what was then I asked D.C now you and I and ... did you folks find as you went through things [noise]\nUm mostly I just enjoy sort of going through the ... the types of material that we had we have things like on transcripts from different programs\nReports we have on her ... papers so a lot of his doodle then we'll to reel tapes from broadcast on so it was really fun to just kind of dig through the actual physical archives and see everything for myself\nI just got another minute or two um you are also recorded or a special collections at the archives so what does that actually means because in to some degree everything's a special collection but but there are certain categories of distinction if you will give us a sense of what people might find\nYeah it's kind of all of the\nReally um rare unique valuable material on a lot of the primary sources so the actual letters that were written reports that were filed on to sort of real like raw materials of history that we have things like rare books the diaries journals letters\nOn things that were taken from the desk of president price and whatnot and now and the kinds of our students and the public can cause an accident\nAnd so much of this material now is on line as well which I find fascinating and also a quite a time drain because I really love the sort of thing having founded and archives myself and going through these but ah if folks go to various places on the website they can find all manner of things give us a sense\nYeah exactly um the librarian\nTrue these but ah it folks go to various places on the on our website they can find all manner of things give us a sense yeah\nExactly on the library dot U.

I yeah I'm I'm a loan for six and five you're on pins and needles on that Sunday\nOn the selection show seven and four were were a lead pipe block because if we go seven and four Jay and means we're six and two in the Missouri Valley football conference one of the toughest conferences in the country if not number one we're number two uh and\nAnd six and two would put us or in second place I think in the Missouri Valley football conference standing so I think we're in if we could win out\nAnd it's a it's a it's a tall order because we've got some tough games ahead starting with the one Saturday but if we went out and go eight and three and we go seven and one in this league I I think we're we're maybe\nLooking at a possible first round by out might be the seventh or eighth seeded but uh I I think to Missouri Valley football conference teams will have a great shot at getting a seat so a tire tomorrow hired\nArea and that yeah exactly that first round by with just be a big and I I think I think you and I ... I have to be aware of just how big these games are every game from now on I mean it's not going to be that we're a lemonade it but man there's so much out there for us to grab that first round by would be just fantastic\nWell and that's a great point because a ... if you can get the first round by that means you get a home game\nIn the second round of the play off you're going to get somebody\nThat had to play on that Thanksgiving weekend that winter's going to have to travel to you just like we won first round last year and then added traveled to South Dakota state who got a first round by so you're absolutely right in and I think North Dakota state has showed the route to the championship game is to get home games\nIn the playoffs so if that's a great point huge game tomorrow point to to ... and we we don't we there's no margin for error I don't think if we want to get to see we we have to win out but as far as getting into the field this year with an at large\nI think seven and four would do it so you're absolutely right Jay you really can't call that a must win\nTomorrow to be a playoff team if we what happened to drop it I think then you're looking at you better went out and go seven and four to assure yourselves a spot in the playoffs but if you want a a top eight seed then yeah then then it's a must win\nExactly hey if you don't mind can shift gears to basketball now I'd have to ask you about absolutely let's do it what's the what's the latest on the injuries to have picked for advice I guess fights not injured but if is is dizziness I guess um what do you know about the\nFight is better or the white coach Jacobson talked about it at at the media day press conference on Wednesday is that the uh it it's not an injury is just it's it was a little bit of a health scare that he's working through a it sounds like they're they\nKind of got to the bottom of the things are looking good he's been around practice um I I think you're going to see him practicing a soon and and able to go I Hope when the regular season starts Pickford\nA news yeah a pick for his is a little a little different I think I think ... in a situation where\nUm he may not play until we get\nA ways end of the season he just my opinion he might be a player that really isn't a hundred percent and in great shape and and ready to you know contribute big time minutes maybe all the way until the start of the conference season but I I don't think they want to rush him along because they they don't want to have any ...\nThey don't keep practicing at all no\nNo he's not he's hasn't even been clear to practice yet he's still he's still recovering so uh yeah pick it up they they it sounds like you probably won't practice until maybe sometime early in November where he'll actually\nJust start to do some practice things but uh and and I don't think I don't I don't think you want to rushing back because we want him a hundred percent healthy\nFor the the guy out of the little ladies and yeah so it it it's been it's been an interesting year injury wise for this basketball team domain guys in and out of practice Spencer hauled him and had had a couple of uh had an issue\nUh he's back in practice and looking good but he was sideline for a while you know about Austin five Pickford it's just been a little bit of a battle with the with the whole injury thing if it happens but you got to get your guys healthy so you can you can have the run that you want to have Jay\nExactly okay why free state the information in a one more one last thing yet um after I win the mega millions tonight at you and I was athletic budgets going to go way uh I Love it I'm going to take care of all I Love right great\nAnd then you bring back baseball to now was that was that\nI Will

mean we're far enough into the season now with you and I sitting three and three you know the schedule got left\nAgree disagree that the eight and three I think we're we're a possible topped eight seed\nSeven and four I I still think we're a lead pipe lock at six and to win the conference and seven and four overall to get an at large birth six and five I'm I I'm a little nervous I they they could leave you out\nGot to get to seven ... seven if for your and no matter what or that that would be seven in for you know you're going to coach Farley house have breakfast and watch the selection show six in five it's I don't know six in but I don't think six and five does it I really don't I don't think you can win six games and get in the loss of Montana hurt the Iowa last doesn't do much to you\nBut I don't think six and five does it I really don't I don't think you can win six games and get in the last the Montana hurts the Iowa last doesn't do much to you\nIn North Dakota state laws or the worry is that the committee know how close it was until the last six minutes and then when he beat deeds South Dakota state or do you be Illinois theater db none of those do you get upset by somebody things like that\nI'm eating three I think it's a flip the coin to get to the top eight it really depends on what everybody else does if some other teams to alter\nMaybe you'd get in because of the quality or when but if you're eating three you're what seven one six and to see or\nNo no you're right you'd be some of that one one seven and one what was the only lost in the one of the toughest conferences to North Dakota state and top twenty five wins over South Dakota\nSouth Dakota state Illinois state and you know Missouri state do you look at the schedule they have had ... not
