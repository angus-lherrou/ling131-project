the guys the little able to walk a little bit\nIn and she wouldn't budge [laughter] I mean just incredible I Wonder what she was really thinking by the end of that interview by the way and it's fascinating to do what ultimately didn't make it because lord knows how much they had that they went ahead and edited out but anyway\nUh so we're talking about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done a ... piece from the specter that put in context our wall of the United nations as bad on their climate predictions every single year for years yet\nFor some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the left now\nI think any honest a decent person you are wrong if you work ... to ... for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you you have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the leftist climate science crowd\nYou're going to keep on keep it on and they're gonna keep on federal and your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies while was that it was the the global cooling and the ice age right\nSo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article that was based on this climate science called another ice age\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story the ... world because that's what was going on\nManmade global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it was like oh crap that's working out so then it became what in the eighties or nineties you'll remember what it was remembered hell every aerosols\nThat's working out so then it became what any any of the nineties you'll remember what it was remember al every aerosol can every little puffs of that hairspray for that big eighties hair that was another chunk out ozone layer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere along the way our\nSystem actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort in this world towards eliminating that we probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those holes [laughter] funny thing is sunspots you know [noise] huh [noise]\nSo that went away and then what did it become balls global warming only got global warming for many years trying and then ...\nNot buying it [noise] so do from global cooling when you go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel does something that's actually real to climate change and that\nHow they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we'd had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat we've had a minimum of three mass extinction events\nAll remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur flatulence you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more polluting than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it as a pita crowds to really think about this for a moment and if we don't need me\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the cow or do you care about uh you know your your climate change there because they got you know we're more cows what's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this\nAnyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of Dinah flatulence and ... flatulence ended up leading to a ... extinction events do ya me just you know following all the logic to its natural conclusion you say\n[noise]\nOnce again two sides to stories\nI joined back simple continue to bring them to do [noise] I Am Brian money and more the gray one Marshall event\n[noise] ya\nDo you remember when comedy was re\nI ah had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn the affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but to break and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards wood frame homes and so the meat of you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane you\nKnow you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know thinking about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures\nThat were built after Ninety two with those upgraded and updated standards that made the difference not only in life and death but it could make the difference in your home being there\nVersus your home be wiped out can make the difference between a community that can be rebuilt and something that isn't even recognizable was mentioning Hurricane Irma last year you go to the uh the lower keys\nYou'll see when you go down there every now and then like huh\nIrma last year you go to the uh the lower keys\nYou'll see when you go down there every now and then like huh wow\nIt seems like there's a lot of space where they're used to be homes\nThat's the case there are there any more Arabs completely wiped out many of them were just taken straight into the ocean and the and the lower keys for McCain through and you've got others ... couple of shingles missing\nCan be the difference a life and death big big deal so anyway\nAh just ah as you're seeing these pictures putting everything in context\nA you know you get it was a I think very very much like Andrew in I think we're very fortunate that it went in in an area that was ... as sparsely populated relatively as that area to minimize the damage the devastation where caused because the the Israel\nBut thank God it didn't go into a place where you had millions of people for example at that science and that strength\nAll right uh been talking about some of the financial frauds the climate fraud throughout the course the show oh

turns out to be our season and a lot of folks come year round for exactly the reason you're talking about health care because yes when you are in that type of environment\nUltimately you're at the mercy of the system and the system ultimately is going to weld dictate unless you end up paying through the nose the exact a different outcome which is why often people come here get better choice

David Cohen [noise]\n\n\nOh\nWell ... new again this is Douglas fir the anti with the master salute himself David Cohen yes we have a very interesting show today yes it is I\nLike let's start off first that was a little bit of a of course from the wizard of Oz what does the wizard of Oz\nPirates and Sherlock Holmes all have in common\nWell what they have in common is a real disease or I guess so yeah ... yeah it's a strange show because we we we have a\nWe have a pitcher a new show that's coming on a and a way to for us to determine whether the show will be successful using all of the characters\nYou just mentioned exactly and here's the thing jak pumpkin had had gotten word when we had a show a long time ago when we were hijacked if you remember the show by kinds of books on balls at yeah and so what happened was we had suggested maybe the two of them get together the kind of like the the losers at this point you know they would\nReally when I I wouldn't say that to know whether or not in the studio and to and you and I as\nThey were kind of you know try and make their way they're just not it's not clicking for that but maybe I did the combined forces\nAre forced to become the synergy maybe all committed it\nGets flowing downhill a little bit you know for them so that we did it produce them they've gotten together and now they're knocking on the door with a pitch for a brand new show and the show they're saying is similar to what will be the new American Pickers you've seen the show\nOn History Channel or they find a two guys try to find hidden treasures in people's like junk ...\nArcheology I think the calls at ... they hook you know and yeah so that so that shows been on forever now it's just very successful and those characters ignore every single request that the oldest do again has made to have\nThe two gentlemen that are on or even one of them from America pickers right come on and then from Iowa where in Iowa all over the place and a lot of that so there are so he was a little pay back to them\nYeah we're going to want to drain this we're going to entertain this pitch and that you'll hear in a minute ah and and I I guess our they don't know this yet but our critique of this pitch is going to be you know how do we are Santa Cade the treasure that they find right you got to know what's real somehow exactly how do we have a way of doing it\nBut let's face it he gets a lot of criticism because he supports the president he was wearing a make America great again\nBut let's face it he gets a lot of criticism because he supports the president he was wearing a make America great again hat on CNN the other night terrorists ... in a panel moderated by Don Lemon\nCalled ... that kind of highly personal highly racial criticism I think is unnecessary ... controversial that's why it was such a wild encounter with your media emitted Howard Kurtz boxers\nYou are listening to everything all these new again Americas entertainment pop culture talk show with Douglas ... and David Cohen\nMy welcome back everything oldest new again as the old el recurring theme from a TV show back in the seventies and that's kind of ... we got to mystery upon mysteries here I'm here with David going a David we are\nIn the midst of for very interesting characters yes we are and pumpkin head from wizard of Oz and kept ... team together to prevent to present to us they want to do the new American Pickers maybe calling an international pickers right\nWe've already corrected the name for them so\nAnd what are they going to do with the show is just real quick\nSo they're gonna balls act finds these treasures and pumpkin had prices them um and that's the\nPremise of the show and we said that's not enough we think would be better element will be ed and we're able able to do this now adding to this factor\nThe a team of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson from the Victorian age through our cell phone we can Skype with them through time and have them authenticate these treasures that have been found by jak pumpkin it from the wizard of Oz of course and kept the bulls eye from everything that we got\nMakes perfect sense to me All right so as well and the way that we're able to ... you know contact Sherlock Holmes in Watson is because we were able to send your iPhone dug back in time so Sherlock Holmes has that we have another phone here and that's how we're able to Skype with\nRespect Sherlock Holmes is Dr Watson and I'm the gentleman is controlling the cells on there's got to have you heard live section this guy on the show like this but he kind of figure out this technology ages not ...\nWell it seemed like he was pretty much blown away by I'd\nLike to go play you get to the birthplace harrowing because I was going to have\nA pumpkin had yes yes we well so let's go right now what is the first item first artifact to have kept in balls that you would like to introduce\nYou got some interesting chemicals that cause just looks like a piece of paper and what are you got there like a photograph should tell us what so what this is\nYeah it's a ... photographs every us ...\nThat's interesting now let me take a look at that and it was All right it it is a source or in an eternity in shape it's ... it's got a a it looks like it's a a a ... a background is that now it's like a light blue sky\nAnd that's where we're talking about ... or ... or ... pounds\n... fly in that among the blue sky in the clouds it's alright\nI homes and watching them holding this up to the sky appears to the phones you can see this uh this picture here\nBy the way the clarity of homes and in Watson's voice over this iPhone might sound a bit unreal because it's so good it's like they're here in the studio with us but it's just the technology that we have here is really a cutting edge so so I guess ... Sherlock I guess Mr Holmes\nWhy don't you kick it off and what you see with this photo that you're seeing through Skype over the phone Sherlock Holmes itself go ahead\nWell dang but it looks like it's actually a ... I mean it's a it's a ... I tend to find the flying object\nThere are things here in the Victorian age\nUm or images of UFOs quite popular now believe it or not\nUm and this is the type of object or the shape is very much in conjunction with\nHow we hear in Victorian England see us though so right off the bat I Would say it fits the image of what we believe one looks like so my first inclination is that this could very well uh be legitimate\nVoters or talked to was and you know there's a little bit of a reality to the situation you're talking as if you will have a legitimate situation we've never found you know the religion but I don't know where you're coming out of it is a show that those are great criminal mind is not one that's an expert in the extraterrestrial just want to lay the groundwork but you're\nQuite right Watson but I Believe in this case seeing these photographic evidence\nIs to me seems to be weighing more on the yes it is real side of the equation guys understand what you're going to take a look at this point it looks like there's some kind of the United states\nAnd ... there's ... bond is yes it does is it fair to say that the United states have also directs now what is it for us this is the first thing I mean overlook the fact that the homes of who it was an air force exactly\nI Believe if I were to do do you use it has something to do with the United states military I Believe it's in a branch of the United states military and has something to do with flying objects in themselves\nAs well as military understands moved to the military has stood moved to look in isolation and the whole middle ... ... is he doing that they are they doing with the right and that there is a time stamp there as well I see as time went on to two oh five\nPete them as I could read this correctly is that they're not going to have I don't\nReally want to be on Monday and my my partner with ... run by a federal federal monitor to oversee was somebody might say air force and must meal I get a photograph of a yes or no\nBut it seems to add some authenticity to it yes with the United states have false a time stamp on it so I Would I Would say yes it seems to add to it the\nHomes understanding those presidents and certainly during the dream is the ducks and I understand this when I I just have to point out that it's a military rule to build them as a as you I\nGot into this just Watson I see I think ... I Am so I was confused for a moment that but I figured it out of it is yes military time\nDoes not go by AM PM if it actually was in the afternoon it would say fourteen hundred hours not to to be and therefore this is a forgery ... a forgery\nWild done what it that's a\nTired the Sherlock Holmes you came up with a solution here that is beyond is\nJoining us on I was the one that brought up but it is a military procedure was Airforce or the military\nLike you know I don't know it was the one that the military ... when the world goes is Sherlock\n... road\nAll the other guys are still talking about twenty Eighteen sure I get home\nNew twenty Nineteen buying new twenty Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred ... with ... hour days saving\nUp to twelve twelve thousand off limits are be no official word\n[laughter] shopper need you now cheap and venture day savings on every twenty Eighteen sheep on Milwaukee's news twenty ... limited all\nEight thousand dollars off and that's our be glad\nTo be Eighteen Nineteen arriving daily more on the corner of college it than a point Rosie the rapid grabbed her jeep dodge ram online\nAuto dot com click rational and you can be sure give more with regret\n[noise] eastern Iowa\nNice tall ...

special show got full in life and in depth look at starting a real estate portfolio when you were still really young and right now\nA real tour in his early thirties who's been buying investment properties for nearly a decade and essence experience grows and using that to help his clients so young and old become successful investors themselves\nJoining us now is Philip Becker real tour and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas in two thousand for dean Philip received the person who just dirty under thirty award from any are and among his investment properties is one in the U.S Virgin Islands Phillip welcome to real estate today\nThanks rarely seen it a tragedy here\nWe're delighted you're here and by the way good choice on where to locate your investment property\nBut not not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nExcellent so Philips how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell when I bought my first investment property Steven I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nTo fill up you also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that a lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the investment game and you know when I first started\nI was my first investment was an owner finance deal and I bought that land which is twenty percent down and so I help a lot of investors especially being younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got\nInto real estate in two thousand nine and a lot of younger people that are able to help that investment and it's great to show them how you know things like solar financing and even use responsibly financial products such as hard money loans can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest and they have no idea how to do it how do you help them\nThink just with every other Clyde it starts with you know a buyer counseling session\nThat lord of the big things I tell my client is don't be afraid to invest outside your market you know even for people that are just getting started especially if there are a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why I mean being involved with\nLow on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean being involved with you know the national association in committee such as the unprofessional network has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lot of times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real estate investors how do they tend to pay for these places\nAnd those kind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me winds by her first investment property she did not sound\nAmazing income but she got fantastic credits in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars all in we were in for a total of eighty seven as she was able to turn that\nThing after a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars making up about a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs on her first investment which was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and fill up you just mentioned getting a hard money alone which is a private individual or a private group who fund a mortgage without the requirements that a major national banquet half so tell us how do you find it hard money long\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way to accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing there's also for\nOil wells but as far as hard money loans it's really just about networking and finding other people have done it we started group called the broker underground and the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share referrals such as\nHard money while individuals so we've got an entire list of different people as well as feedback from agents good or bad on how\nThe experience was for the consumer answer the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think networking is is so key for trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and and can help your clients\nFill up that is such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years ahead\nThere simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is now\nWith the people that are older you don't want to leave for the people that are older\nIt's not too late but those that got started in investing in their twenties [noise] they're simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them\nNo ice I Love that will fill up I really appreciate you joining us on the show today and sharing your strategies your tactics and your techniques for investing in real estate

Iowa\n... is a national thirty under thirty on hurry and is currently serving as NPR's commercial and business specialties liaison for president Elizabeth ... of course not welcome back to real estate tobacco\nThanks so much for having me back\nWe are so glad you're here so of course the first of all how business\nIt's fantastic and is always good that's all I can\nSay that's wonderful so crushed a year now thirty three years old twelve years ago you bought your first investment property [noise]\nBut I Know that even though you are a real estate investor your heart is really with clients helping them grow a portfolio\nThat will generate income and wealth overtime\nAbsolutely absolutely I you know I was lucky enough to have that opportunity than that the young age and given that opportunity the other is really why is that for me\nOf course when you are young real estate investor get started first of all how young is young who is your youngest investor ever\nYou know what I actually had a young kid from my home town actually that bought his\nFirst which actually one of the investment because it needed to work it was a foreclosure that he had found and he was willing to put it work out and he had just graduated ... Eighteen so yes\nI think he bought the property and like June and he had just graduated in may and his parents help them you know with a little bit of a down here because it was\nNot going to be financed graphic gay or anything like that but he got to find it on his own he held a job through high school that he showed at the end I think I'm a cover that they are in it and it was crazy by far the youngest\nThat is\nYou know on his own he held to a job through high school that he showed at\nNothing to cover the payment and it was crazy by far the youngest\nThat is awesome and so when people come to you and they're very young and they say I Want to invest in real estate what did they tell you about the reasons why\nHonestly most young investors are looking to build a stable future which I think it's so encouraging now because I you know our generation is is really good at only wanting to do the things that they've signed\nFun and so I Love the fact that they actually see you know investing in real estate and then they are ... and ... and the hard work themselves as something that's a fun activity for them so I it's really encouraging\nMe to if I Want to invest in real estate and by my very first property am I going to need you know a great credit be really solid reserves like money in the bank and be a really high income or not so much\nWell you know obviously life an easier one of those things are are there but it's certainly not something that should stop you from investing actually you know one of my my biggest investors I've been working with and I first got my licence eleven years now he's built as very impressive as if he's got\nHundreds of units across the state of Iowa a little bit you know across the border and Illinois and the bad guy and he bought his very first property on contract he ended up buying the property on contract from a landlord there was just tired of having to every model every time at the Kennedy without\nYou know you're paying your carpet things like that plan to ride it out and then felt like you know I put all this aren't very good I think I should probably try to sell it and you know it's sold right away so that's where he got his very first and that's a good start going so he bought his very first event so property on contract with I think\nI remember right it was something like three or four thousand dollar down with the owner financing situation if you just build from there so it's it's crazy what you can do it a little bit of resourcefulness\nThat is awesome and among your clients are a lot of them young\nYou know I Will say that you know I feel pretty diverse client base which I'm very proud of it at this point\nBut a lot of mine that ... that the one that I was just telling you about that I've been working with for over eleven years you know he had been investing in the ... in his\nEarly twenties he's now forty nine and has built something that and I consider forty nine young especially that he'll felt like he built and you know he started in their early twenties and he hadn't steps and fill out a good chunk of mine that's definitely what I think they're young\nSo let's look at the big picture a person comes to you in their twenties and they start investing in real estate tell me how is that going to change their life as the years pass\nI'm sure you've heard that the million times and I am very different context on on the show here but the one beautiful thing about real estate and you make or lose money only one yourself so if you can buy into something early if you can start building that portfolio of rental especially and happier Kennan paying your mortgage for you and building equity for you\nIf you can do that at a young age the sky's the limit on what you can do because that first and that's that that second in back to that third invest but it's something that you can continuously snowball enrolled in a down payment options for a bigger and that that and you just keep going at it grow exponentially in a way that you would never imagine on paper\nThat is great advice well Chris I really appreciate you coming on the show today in talking about investing in real estate at a young age thank you\nAbsolutely thanks for having me anytime\nYou're very welcome Christopher clerk real tour and investment specialist with century Twenty one signature real estate

barriers that prevent us from sabotage in our financial success\nThat coming or special show for life\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nToday we're going to look at some fascinating trends involving smart because you\nKnow you might not have an Amazon Echo or the Google Home or the apple home pod but according to an article on slate the do suggest that someday you might\nThey cited a survey from adobe which says in January of this year Eighteen percent of American households owned some type of smart speaker\nBut in the months since then that number has jumped exponentially and now thirty two percent of American households have a smart speaker nearly a third of all American homes and by the end of this year it just made it half the homes in America will have a smart speaker\nAnd forty percent of those we'll have more than one\nWhat everyone's doing with the echo the Google Home or their apple pie for that there were some really interesting and surprising results\nOkay the number one activity that Americans use with their smart speaker at home according to a survey from Nielsen Ninety percent of the people were smart speakers use them to stream music and Dora modify Google music Amazon Music or apple music\nNext up eighty one percent report using their smart speaker to get real time information traffic\nAnd whether next according to Nielsen Seventy five percent use them to get factual information like trivia or history and sixty eight percent use them to listen to the news but\nIn a tie with news and this is fascinating sixty eight percent also said they use their smart speakers for something completely different they're using them to have fun just to have fun and you\nTell me a joke a ladder during a performance to reach the high no\nThat's right people are asking for laughs or they try to stump are smart speaker was difficult for fun questions\nAlexa how many inches from the earth to the sun\nWonderful and the last one on the list plan your meals\nYeah this may sound kind of basic but we really can tend to overpay for not only food but dining out when we just don't have a plan for our meals and so I'm a big believer in thinking about it on a weekly basis making sure that you've got enough to make multiple meals\nSo to save time if you make a lie or once and then maybe put it in the freezer and make lunches ahead of time anything that you can prepare ahead of time is probably going to save your money and definitely going to save time so it's just one way to simplify your life so that you can

sure kids properly\nMaintained joining us is Tim\n... president of the American society of home inspectors ... is the oldest and most respected non profit professional organization of home inspectors in North America and has more than eight thousand members Tim welcome to real estate today\nThank you glad to be here we're delighted to hear so here we are getting into the fall season what should I Do first if I Want to make sure that my home is in tip top shape\nFirst thing I Would do is check your gutters and down stops because the biggest issue was at home is water and in the fall gutters get clogged up with leaves and other debris and need to make sure that you keep those ... down spouts clean so the water gets removed away from the house you don't have any moisture intrusion\nYou know that's a really good point okay so the gutters and down about bats where to start now what about the windows and doors what am I looking for their Tam\nYou want to make sure your windows and doors are caught concealed properly southern cold there doesn't get into the house [noise] make sure you're one does function\nA lot of times people leave their screens in the window as we tell people take your screens out storm for the winter because the ice and snow and sleet and hard cold weather can really take its toll on screen so we suggest people to take their screens out\nSame thing was screen door's takers screen door screen out and put in your storm door\nSo what about the roof now how can I really know if my roof is in trouble or not what do I need a pair of binoculars\nOr you could use that that is true but I Would recommend contracting a qualified roofing contractor and have them come out and inspect your rough they can let you know if there's any damage shingles they can also let you know\nHow long it ... alas what the estimated life as but again that's another place a lot it can get into the home that's absolutely\nRight now a lot of us think about getting the air conditioning system service before summer but is that another area that you should have inspected prior to the winner\nAbsolutely a lot of HVAC contractors have maintenance contracts where they charge you a nominal fee if you have both of those check and so what they do as they come out in the fall and they check your furnace\nAnd they come back at it in the spring and check your air conditioner so that's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue but to make sure that furnish us functioning properly and efficiently also helps to reduce your heating bills gas or electric\nInteresting another area in the house that I Know is really important especially in the cold weather months is the installation but Kim how does a homeowner insect back\nSometimes that's difficult it's by staying in the walls but in the addict people can get up there and they can now measure the insulation see how much they have in specific areas of the country\nYou have more insulation or less insulation so if you're up in Minnesota or main they\nProbably have more insulation in the addict than you would maybe in in Washington DC and Virginia the Carolinas because they don't get the cold weather like they do with the north so I Would strongly recommend having an installation contractor come out and inspect that have all the best that you can make an all insulation is one of the\nBest because even though you spend dollars\nIt's already know how he will get that back in lower air conditioning and heating bells\nInteresting Tim obviously are shows on all over the United states some parts of the states are going to be warm and sunny all winter long well of course others will be covered with snow so are these fall prep strategies appropriate for your house no matter where it is\nAbsolutely and the fall if you're in a southern climate South Florida Arizona you may want to have your air conditioner checked again because during the summer months it really works hard almost twenty four seven so it's\nBest to do that at both in the spring and in the fall and and he was warm weather climate by having your furnace center air conditioners service in the fall or the winter yeah matter where you live I can say the homeowner money on their utility bills\nThat's very interesting because yes in the southern states people are going into a season in which you're going to continue to need their air conditioning even after this brutally hot summer we just went through\nThat's true very true\n[noise] official home of a un I Panthers the news ...
