good game defensively out of the entire defense led by Duncan third team tackles by Duncan perch delete the team also had\nThree pass breakups what just what an outstanding defensively pepper\nAnd you kind of shifted around from that three three to four down Lyman you just seemed like you you had tearing Christian in that high powered office bottled up a lot tonight what did you see what did you feel about how your your teams that your team did on that side of the football\nYeah I definitely switching from three man for man the blocking schemes are messed up so I burst out the back of the yard or something then they bring in personnel and we knew we switch it up on a minute of every single down like ... come out with something else and that's got to mess up the airline that he doesn't know who's coming in who just drop in who's blitz and so we're we're doing pretty good right now\nUh to hold them to three field goals I mean this is the team that was averaging over forty eight points again five hundred and thirty yards of ... per game does it feel like and it may be hard to call but does it feel like this was the best overall deep in the ... as a team so far this year with what you did today don't get\nYeah definitely watch in film and hold them to nine points it's huge it's after the north Dakota state game with the defense that's just way too many points right there in the yard so we knew we had to change something about Mary ... different defense now so we switch that up and that's been working for ...\nThrough a lot of passes the Jack rabbits that you couldn't get a ... but you at you guys had pressure on tearing Christian it seemed like all night\nOh yeah he's you save on film you might be the fastest guy on the field at certain times he takes off so we knew that the subways are going to have to guard there's years for ten seconds so are DVDs that get jobs sticking to him and he would roll out\nYou know they lost a couple of great guys to throw two in God or who's in the NFL in when a key or who had a shot with the Vikings but they they kind of reloaded that receiver ... it looked like they had tough guys to guard in the passing gay\nYeah they they always have some guys are like number fifty and he's always good they're running back number eight that way that's who we were pretty worried about your the quick he's quick on shelves so that that take something away from them but I mean there's just a good defense of effort by everybody\nOr you had to lead a defense today that they went without Calera Vick\nAnd Thomas a couple of regular starting linebacker ... was you and a couple of rookies I mean not rookies age wise but new starters just how do you feel those guys play today in starting role Lambert along with son get\nYeah

fourteen minutes left to go a couple of other scores of interest in Big Ten foot pole today I Will beat Maryland on a Hawkeye homecoming afternoon at ... stadium twenty three to nothing I walked over Maryland and in\nVolleyball action last night in the cloud center\nThe un I Panthers defeated in state rival Drake three sets too so you and I ... led by Bobby Peterson improved at ten and the old in Missouri Valley conference play\nTo start league play with the aid conference match just to go you an eye on top of the league at Cannes and all the panther volleyball team plays at home tomorrow\nI Know nothing probably surprises you or catches you off you been at this a long time but are you a little bit surprised that this ended up being as low scoring game as it was with too often says that came into the game putting up a lot of points\nI I Am surprised to be honest with you I thought I washed their offense and wash the quarterback and I see what they could do to us for everybody they played so far\nSo I was just trying to figure out how to slow this down and how to how to match the score and that I really felt their off as would have to really scored a night and that's what he always courtroom you needed two biggest one for them was when they they matched the field goals after they got within five I thought that was huge\nAnd it allowed us to do some things on defence when that happened but leading up to that I I really feel really good about our office right now the tail at that time that the way that they're playing the confidence they have\nBut we shot herself in the foot a few times out there that I Wish we would have finished some of those drives and got a field goal but\nAh Austin earth and nobody ever talks about him 'cause we're not kicking that many fields but he had that huge field goal today and he's he's had someone going down the stretch and you know he's really kicking the ball well right now with a lot of confidence too so we're fortunate we've got three phases of the game that defense we're always trying to shore up but uh I think we've\nWe've got a chance if we just can't keep just to stay home on the work and what we're doing and play one play at a time\nYeah you're right that thirty two yard field goal by Austin earthen with three fifty three left to playing the game to put your backed up by eighth\nWas was a big field goal on on that drive you get another deep them see touched down today brunch day wells got you want a week ago on a bumble recovery a scoop and scorn Xavier Williams sealed it with a pick six at the end of this game yeah he\nDid I was I didn't see what happened ... firing the feeling that I saw somebody get hit pretty good over there\nBut I can see it with all the celebrating going on I thought the game was over\nAnd then I look up for kicking a field goal and it's like okay I really didn't want to get that I'd rather have taken a navy right there and the game was over but\nEverything worked out for for the best at Xavier made a great play if you got players have fun and he was ticket halfway actually came up to me after the game and he goes coach I just wanted to score one type of my career so [laughter] so what do you what do you say to that [laughter]\nThe fence or did some good things to the ... done no turnovers tonight didn't throw an interception through the one touchdown pass\nDidn't get sacked and then the wild cat was affecting again against the Jack rabbits like it was similar a year ago at their place why Miller Ninety nine rushing yards and the second half a hundred and eight for the game just it was it just seemed like a good mix of your regular on fence and then working in that wild cat some too\nI was with him we unveil until the second half\nAnd uh I was fortunate that worked and things like well force in markets around that so well and then but they open up some other stuff too but he lives really been playing well ah\nHe is a ... he's our quarter back I mean he is he's everything that I Hope he will be right now he's making good throws are offensive lines got great protection right now we're just playing at a very good level right now we just have to be a little bit more consistent and keep keep building off what we've done\nA ... was that by designed not to show the wildcat until the second half or or or did it just happened to just work out that way that you didn't run any wild cat or we call the wild panther by then I said in the first half\nWell it it turned out that way but it was you don't want to unveil it at certain times and how the first quarter unfolded we we could have brought it out earlier but I thought it worked out very well the way that unfolded we had to do it very early in the third quarter to see if it's going to work was or what was their scheme for this year\nTo take away the Wildcats so he had to show it early 'cause you can test with it and play with it late but we had a few little other nuance has that we had done in years past with it they're really open up like that swing to the outside the open side and and get to the perimeter that was that was not there last year and it really that was a couple of big place for us [noise]\nNote turnovers by your team again tonight which in big games like this has always critical the other thing is you're almost played penalty for football for I think just for penalties against the Panthers in this one tonight\nI Want to jinx her team but you know they're so discipline right now I mean we have our issues during the week everything's not perfect but man they're they're so disciplined there they they do it there has to do and they try to do within\nThe realm of the game without holding without penalties without jumping off size was and that's kind of shows how higher locked in\nNow wish I could say it looked like that on Tuesday Wednesday 'cause there's of headaches on those days but because of what how we stress on during the week I think it's it has helped them when they get their game day like this that you know they sit in there to do good job in the ... but you got to give you like right now he like by how he has taken charge it's a lot easier to\nBe more discipline in office when you're a leader is more decisive and more commanding and I think that's what I've seen more so out of Iraq and how he's becoming more of a\nA conscious commander

you're all now I mean what what is going into that I mean that just doesn't happen and I and I tried to give credit to the staffing I forgot her and Savage is the last now and there were there and like I couldn't pull it up apologize that airs doing I think a good job of those cores that whole staff really you got to be pleased with what those guys are doing defensively because they put\nIt in a lot of stuff you've got a lot of stuff on the defensive side of the ball there's\nA lot of stuff [laughter]\nBut I'll tell you what we got some\nYou know it is a great staff defense of staff room to sit in it just it's fun to be in there\nAnd and then you go to all the all sets aside a whole different demeanor over there but another great side of the ball over there and how they jailed I think that's probably the thing I've seen the most offensive coaches have Jell together with a staff meeting this morning to go through the whole game plan\nAnd that same meeting going in Montana that I could just when I went home I felt much more comfortable\nIn this meeting than I did and that made him because of what got done in the lesser time just because you understand how to communicate with them they understand what I'm trying to achieve and guys all all of them have ideas I mean all of them not just one guy doing it but they all have ideas they all are invested in it and then when they had success with their plan that's what you're happy for\nHow do you the difference how did they spent the time because I mean it doesn't to the average man you know three down Lyman for down doesn't make much but that's a big difference in in its two entirely different defenses that Iran oh trust me\n[laughter] shuts off [laughter] but it's\nIt's if we can pull this thing off I mean we're\nWe're confusing people are\nConfusing yourselves that I mean that's the players' part of the coast because we've got to figure out rules to make it all work and\nAnd and make it work with and everything but\nIt's been good has there's a lot of people involved in this and the staff it starts with the staff and then it comes down to the players and the players got to execute right now where where\nWe've had two weeks of trial by air trial by fire and we've we've passed both tests and and we're going to get trial by fire next week because we're learning as they're learning and Everytime he shows up on a film somebody's going to make some adjustments and then we got to figure that out of how they're trying to go after what we've been doing\nWe don't want to jinx it but you're still you're still perfect scoring points in the red zone I mean six games and is there some games in that's amazing to me that that does happen because you know they're just you know and and I imagine you know you spend a lot of time on red zone office I'm sure\nWe do but we're number one red zone off as last year and the country and have that consistency even into six games or seven whatever at right now that's that's scheme as coaches\nThat's players making place and it always helps to have a kicker like we have\nBecause if we don't get the touchdown he's finished now for the kick so there's a lot going on behind the scenes but it's it's a it this was a team win and that's what we said to her team today with all the address you talked about earlier and everything we've been through the only way we're going to be South Dakota state was was a great team today we weren't gonna beat him because of one player because of one\nThe jak headed deep in their own territory trailing by eight we're still trying to pull off a minor miracle to get this game tied but the panther defense and save your Williams said nothing doing\n[noise] and now the Jack rabbits habit if their whole nine\nThey need to go in Ninety One yards and score a touchdown handed to point conversion tie this game\nThirty two seconds left the White House and no time out [noise]\nWorks from that short shotgun twins right twin ... [noise] to snap [noise] looking to throw does and it [laughter]\n\n\n\nX marks the spot is it your Williams with the pick six the extra point was get good by Austin Earth I'm twenty three seconds\nLeft in the game on that touchdown was scored it made it twenty four to nine that you and I and then a couple of past plays by South Dakota state and time elapsed and the panther celebrate\nA twenty four to nine when over number two ranked\nSTDs you\nHere's a quick recap of the other scores the Indiana State when's today twenty four Twenty one over SSI you western Illinois beach Missouri state thirty one fourteen North Dakota state over Illinois state twenty eight fourteen\nAnd now or the other game has gone final in Youngstown, Ohio Youngstown State beat South Dakota twenty nine Seventeen Panthers wind here at home twenty four nine of final thought Scott Peterson about a homecoming one\nPanthers twenty four number two STDs you nine\nOh it's fun and it sounds good and I mean that was a much needed victory by the panther team as showed a lot of improvement from the beginning of the season to to where they are now now they know they just have to keep doing that as as a season progress is\nAll right we'll see it in ...

[noise]\nTwenty four to nine or the second ranked team in MCS fantastic wind for the Panthers man that was fine\nUh yeah we've got lots to talk about tonight so I Want you to give your input a huge crowd in the dome tonight so ah I remember\nThe last home game we had a couple of fans calling out the students action what looks like they showed up tonight with over twelve thousand in the dome so we've got lots of talk about so give me those calls three one nine two three five Fifteen forty eight hundred five eight four seven zero to for the numbers to call\nExpress your opinions your thoughts your happiness if you're out partying\nYou may call why not it's a great night parties homecoming weekend Panthers had a great victory no reason not to be out celebrating\nJust a great when I was very excited so what we normally do I I I share my thoughts of the first half and then I share my thoughts of the second half and then we've got other stuff to get too so um let's let's get right down to it\nYou and I again and this must be there and I want I don't quite understand that but they seem to starts slow\nAlmost every game and it always makes me nervous\nEven this getting their first went to um I think the what three now the first couple of ... or at least they punted the first couple of positions and South Dakota right off the bat march right down the field kicked a field goal now the deep and tell them to build on what you thought was great but I'm like oh this is not good\nYou know and then you and I I'm there for Dr I Believe stalled out and then ...\nThe billboards about was great but I'm like oh this is not good you know and then you and I I'm their first Dr I Believe stalled out and then South Dakota right down the field again now they missed the field goal among okay but then you and I pointed\nAnd then I think I'm South Dakota upon did\nAnd\nYou know look for a while that the Jack rabbits we're just going to we're\nJust going to kind of hanging around a little bit hang around and they just start lighting up cars that quarterback or Christians in his had a pretty good arm and he's\nFairly accurate I mean he wasn't great tonight but you you could see that this guy as well based in South Dakota scores a lot of points are actually the second team NFC at some point scored scoring almost forty eight points a game held to nine tonight's normally they are a high powered off bench\nAnd so again when they're margin right down the field on us I I was a little nervous but don't you an ID fence\nMy goodness just fantastic again and that really is what's been doing it for the Panthers that defense and I think that's what's going to get them if we can finish out our schedule we can win out\nI think the playoffs are real good pasta but and I would love to love to see North Dakota state again I I Want I Want the ... and again I Would love that rematch 'cause I think we could do it 'cause I that even just gets better and better um\nAgain held the sub to go to state forty four yards rushing in the first half now we did give up a hundred and forty or receiving yards but again just stopping the ride they had nowhere to go and again the only place South Dakota state could go they went to the edges again the same thing that I'm South Dakota did\nThey they attacked us on the edges and that was pretty much what they were able to do so um but the middle of the field there was there was nothing happening I mean they're getting the officer was okay they had the one sixty a touchdown driving the first um which was great but a lot of drive just kinda seemed to stall out the up and just really never\n[laughter] him to really get a lot fire you know first anyway um don't get perch had a great first half six tackles you had to pass broken up I'm done six or ten a hundred and Seventeen years that the touched down in the first\nUh let's see ... I had the one touched down a catch for twenty seven years a deer machine had a great night get three reception fifty six yards in the first and to run again really wasn't do a whole lot but we again we didn't need it to\nSo things were looking really good in the first I was very happy um 'cause you can that defense just playing lights out that was just a lot of fun to watch all\nBut this this panther demon that defense I really again you we took out the number two scoring team an app see as normally scoring forty eight points\nPer game\n\nHuge when he would win for the Panthers three one nine two three four Fifteen forty eight hundred five eight four seven zero to four of the numbers the Columbus is the home of the Panthers post game called Joe my name is Mike Davis so glad to have you on\nA date with let's grab another call my man mark from proactive and mark\n\n... hey what's going on oh I'm great when tonight um I I guess maybe the whole you know I think to me the big thing was\nPenalties they only had four no turnover\nAnd I I think that was huge in the game like this\nPlus the fact I bet defense is just incredible\nIf if we could get the deep friends playing like that in a game where the audience is clicking on all cylinders heaven help anybody that we play I don't care who it is\nI I think it would be an unbelievable game um I Know the the two guys on the pits that were hurt our my question is are how long are they out to her early season ending injuries\nThat is a great question marks and I I don't have an answer for that may be\nOr are they a season ending injuries\nAnd that is a great question mark and I I don't have an answer for that\nMaybe ... ... I'm going to look at chase again ... he's the guy who could look stuff up as ... as best we can I can maybe now I put pressure pressure on Jason I'm yeah I don't know the answer that I even talked about it um yeah quarterback was actually he was on the jury rice watch list for a freshman of the year and\nI don't know if he's out with these I Hope not because we can get those two guys back\nI mean the difference is already as good as it is but we do more pieces as you said they're scary good\nWell it it just seems like the death is doing so well on the table this year too so you know that means a lot going through the rest of the season and I got another question okay they beat number two\nIf we lose one game the rest of the season I Wonder wouldn't beating this number two team be enough to put us in the playoff\n... you know I I I mentioned earlier that you know I I did this would this we had to win this to remain in the playoffs\nYeah absolutely I think if we lose like okay if we'll lose to an on rank gee we're probably out if we lose let's say because I Know Illinois state is right in their top ten if we lose the Illinois state\n... ... we live we lose a close game the Illinois state I think we can stay in the playoffs will need some other stuff that happened were going to need help\nOr hurt so I wanted to record drought there there's a lot of good records as a whole lot of good teams but uh yeah we can lose a close one of ... I don't want to lose any but if we can we have to lose one I'd rather it was a close game to Illinois state\nRight right yeah that that'd be the formula I guess if they could just keep playing like they are so got a little bit of improvement every game and their their team probably go all the ways you need a little bit of luck but God this was a fun game to lift that go on\nAnd it just I guess the only thing I critter or criticize if he didn't want to call criticism was\nSure wish that they could have got that first down the last time they had the ball if you set of turning back over to them and giving them a shot but I mean they got a good defense to thought right it it was it was fun to lift the going\nOn now may be too we could get Gary to get a little bit more excited when in his Blake all like the\n[laughter] I'll let you know I'll I'll mention that to him oh yeah All right up to almost ... Gary come on\nThere we go there we go [laughter] all righty you're you're going to have a great even I\nBet you do mark [noise] those are the home of the ... most game call in show a new doctor ... three one nine two three five fifty forty eight hundred by made for seven zero to for the number to call will take a quick break we'll be back with more on news talk Fifteen forty ...\nThere's more of the home of the Panthers dot com post game show coming up exclusively on news talk Fifteen forty ... yeah [noise]\n\nCars like Chaplin Nineteen Seventy eight [noise] foreigner in the rocky\nPlace and my ... wearing new discovery live around every corner of the top of every mountain\nHere the only thing more refreshing then you're kind of venture why not [noise]\nLike corn light is longer and cold or a lighter prospecting filtered comb to ensure brilliant and clarity right now a package and call him our peak refreshment [noise]\nCosts tennis restless spirit the ones who starts from on his arm nothing left in the world not crashing their\n[noise] orange like salmon Eighteen course for a company called in Colorado and brain respond [noise]\nTexting roles for alerts in office the automatic tax message misdemeanor which may apply\nHello America this is Martha Stewart now you can cook great casing dinners this home\nAnd it's easy to forget about frozen foods and take out and said during me for great home cooked food introducing Martha and released Neal kitten repression fresh ingredients as my wonderful easy to follow recipes\nDelivered right to your door and right now you can try to treat for free for a very limited time I'm offering three free Martha and moral eastern meals to everyone anywhere imagine\nCooking butter based in state ... pork tenderloin cheese chicken and more with new recipes every week Mars and mercury still and helps you put a delicious dinner on your table and around thirty minutes\nFor three free meals and free shipping tax the young to two four six eight ten just kept the word yum did two four six eight ten for details hurry three free won't last long taxed yum to two four six eight ten\nDiabetes high blood pressure high anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty year old male maybe it would be for you or even was type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of Fordham older life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big Lu at eight hundred for a one\nFourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big Lou dot com\nRemember big lose like you to use on madness too\n\nYou're listening to the home of the Panthers dot com post game call in show explosively on news talk Fifteen forty gay actually yeah here again is Mike Davis\nA huge homecoming one from the un I Panthers twenty four to nine over these second rank South Dakota state you have to wrap it\nOver the vendors most game ... of the vendors dot com oppose game call in show mine it was my day with three one nine to five Fifteen forty eight hundred five eight four seven zero for the number ... we'll check back to the phone lines\nAnd Marion are you doing Cathy\nAmy go cancer or any co Panthers gray win tonight\nFor a number so yeah we play it at home or in Chile another like a third okay and I think if even if we get beat by that and that's why we're in ...

you're just joining us I have Dr Michael Pincus on the line with us today we've been talking about\nDr ... fast melt vitamin D three formula and this\nVitamin D deficiency is really an epidemic now causing all kinds of health concerns about the issue is even if you're trying to get vitamin D back in your body you're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd documenting is why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this\nWrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it and documenting is why we started here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all of the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D\nThe fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there and the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside\nAnd most of us get no vitamin D from the shot what\nMakes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all I put five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet they can actually feel the difference second I use the right type of vitamin D and my formula\nAnd third I've worked with an advance team of scientists and they're using this technology to put in this vast

that you get from people that have been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and his blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... says vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred\nFor one three seven four nine five you know as we've been talking about here\nDr paint gives his vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your

subscription programs this was a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor one three seven four nine five I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for one three seven four nine five\nSo how 'bout folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on\nAnd Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWhile there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body and still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of tastes\nIn the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deed is going to end up going up and out through the roof where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short developments and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn it on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties boy you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active and\nWhen you're in your fifties it starts feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on this formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and clarity\nYou know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pick is such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath on in the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like this\nAnd the sooner you can get on my formula the better I you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here I Know\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and Dr biggest looking someone expect when they start taking your fast melts the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that something is changing your body because the kick start so many different cycles and your body that you'll start having less pain having more energy and having

this was a very very liberal institution then I looked at their alumni lists that they had prominently posted on the wall e's with the leading humanists as secular activists included the name of Iraq\nEd prominently posted on the wall games with the leading humanists as secular activists and included the name of ... saying Obama\nIs that the lights went on three days and that there's somebody on the staff they're discovered that I had written some articles critical of radical Islam\nThat was a huge no no it was called into the office I look back now and I laugh at it was wasn't funny at the time I was called into the office of the president of the school and all of the principles of the grade levels and\nA rated for well over an hour about Islam as a religion that pace and you're pro Israel it and it was just an acquisition\nWas soundly rejected from the school because of this article I been careful not to say things that we're all really controversial although that's hard for me to do but I\nI really myself back in in the assemblies you know I was soundly rejected talk lead the campus immediately and I actually kind of where that is a little bit of a badge of honor because in no pickle by who loves them and who checks them\nI really counted and honor to be rejected by these people because they saw something in me that made them very very angry\nWas Jesus they saw Jesus and me and I wasn't one of them\nWas and the fact that it was founded by Christian missionaries and taken over by liberal humanist and then Obama graduated from the school in Nineteen Seventy nine that you went there to talk about nine eleven\nAnd they were Muslims they were when salami terrorists it's a shame that after nine eleven we get this don't say anything bad about Muslims and couldn't even speak the truth we had to say oh this is a peaceful religion which it's not\nYeah capable of way too far bending over backwards trying to reassure everyone\nIslamic that we didn't blame them for this because they use that kind of as a catalyst to gloss over the darker aspects of the Koran the actual teachings of Muhammad having studied a little bit of the Koran and the beef myself I've come to the conclusion if you really lean\nOn and say if you really believe with Islam actually teaches you have to become\nA terrorist you have to be on the hottest anything less than that as compromised and in the middle east today there are a lot of moderate Muslims\nWho are being held and\nSlaughtered by fellow Islamist because they're not radical enough they're not taking up the sort of Islam This is reality sadly most of our children in our schools are being brainwashed into thinking that Islam is a religion apiece as you said it's not a threat but the exact opposite is true\nYou know that's a good Bruce wasn't Baptists booze who flew the planes into the towers is not Baptists or Buddhist who are the number one terrorist throughout the world\nAmerica so mixed with so many different

selfishly\nBut I have to claim to this hope God's chasing this nation will have a greater blessing in the end just something greater something better something expressive of his larger plan is going

I mean the idea that this guy walked in the room with Fifteen security people\nGot in a fight and it was actually killed in that have happened to have a parent and ability to dismembered him and get rid of him\nThat happened to be there this is a stupid so why is the president saying it's credible president is trying to walk a tightrope between I think it's a big problem not a small one on one hand you know you don't want to break the alliance with the Saudis on the other hand you cannot teach\nAt thirty three year old crown prince and you can get away with things that are this outrageous and the stupid or he will be out of control for the next four years so would you do because I my guess is going to get to select the sanctions\nAnd they're going to be very clear about it I also think that I'm guessing but my guess is the ... pretty aggressively you got to come up with the truth this is just this hurts the Saudis to live this stupidly\nSecretary of state Pompeo met with the Saudi crown prince this way can took some criticism for appearing overly friendly in such a serious situation here's what ... said when he returned to Washington was the\n... I think it's important for all the number two we have long since Nineteen thirty two over long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n[noise] congresswoman home and I want to address exactly the dilemma that ... that that Speaker Gingrich was talking about on the one hand what apparently happened the shell gay is unacceptable on the other hand we do have strategic interests with Saudi Arabia how do we balance all that\nWell our foreign policy is based on values and interests are values that we have our rule of law and for the ... interests that we have are having Saudi Arabia is an ally against a\nA Iran's malign behavior among other things and maybe helping that Jared Kushner with his\nIn St Louis English doesn't seem to be going very far between Israel and Palestine but at any rate murder I totally agree with Newt a murder and uh this reckless war in Yemen or not there are values or our interests and I think that that in addition to sanction would be good to talk to the king\nAbout perhaps moving ah Mohammed ... sideways for a while and putting a an adult charges Saudi Arabia\nSuch as well how that may not have the intelligence chief who was widely admired but now he's under house arrest because in the ocean or even the Adel al Jabari that foreign minister comedian bathroom here again highly regarded and very authentic\nAnd I I mean if you have a much better sense of this and I do do you think that the president were to go to the king and say that or to the ruling family and say that that we have a boat weed out we can apply pressure\nI don't think we have a vote yes I think we can apply pressure and it is also true obviously it their major financial transactions pending not just with aerospace firms are but also with high tech firms\nI think the modernization program and I actually think are telling you agree with that was going in the right direction that we can accept that or the railing it and I think Saudi Arabia wants me to a modern future so they they better do a course correction here\nMark let's talk about the realities in Congress that used to be your job but uh until very recently as the legislative affairs director for President Trump\nAs we were discussing with Rand Paul he came within four votes last year a blocking an arms sale to the ... what do you think are the prospects for any future arms sales in the ... future and how do you think\nCongress because a lot of Republicans are talking top on those two how topics they're prepared to get with a ...\nI think the prospects any future sales are quite them but I actually think of prospects are greater than perhaps at our policies indicating that Congress would actually take proactive steps to unwind the most recent uh arms deal\nI think very little that transactions country I think you can see a movie by Congress to move forward particularly if there's a vacuum from the administration responding quickly in responding to the ... so I think that actually the risk there is actually much more significant to federal policy in as to what Congress can do in the near term then what about other sanctions\nThink that's an as they go together crashed because of the administration steps forward and take sanctions that are lower the pressure on Congress to act but diminished ration doesn't do that that I think you'll see a ... a vacuum in which Congress step forward and looks to move more quickly perhaps even as soon as soon as the a lame duck session Chuck\nThis is personal for you because ... was a colleague of yours at the Washington Post your reaction to the Saudi account and to President Trump's seeming acceptance of that Saudi account so far\nBoth take the Saudis account for that reminds me of that famous phrase from Watergate to modify limited and hang\nA this is what you do when you've been caught your covers been blown and there's really no denying it anymore she was a little bit of the truth out\nWhere you try to reshape a more plausible cover story remember they had been saying that ...\nLeft that constantly alive that had been their previous view of the matter so the um the story is as the speaker and everyone else here said is is not a credible story it's they're desperate attempt to preserve\nThe the crown prince and his position and by the way they are even willing to sacrifice apparently some fairly senior officials that leads to the\nExtent of scapegoating them and and firing them\nUm but uh the trouble with President Trump's reaction to this so far from my point of view as Ben I'm that it's taken him a long time to declare that this was evil and stupid his first reaction was something like well you know it's not an American citizen and it's not on our soil\nAnd that was probably consistent with some things he said in the campaign about how you know we Americans we kill a lot of people and so on he's got a lot he's dug himself a deep hole I'm afraid on that point and I don't think he's all the way out of it yet mark I\nPeople and so on he's got a lot he's dug himself a deep hole I'm afraid on that point and I don't use all the way out of it yet Mart I agree with what the Carson was saying before that there's there's a lot here they are trying to balance I think the president tried to give them a little bit of the president came out of the Washington Post and said he does not believe the cow to sue what they've said\nA was a result of a fistfight or he's acknowledged the incredulous that but I Do think as well that there's a lot that they're trying to balance here the the the Iran funding and Hamas as well as killing last shares continually throughout\nThe middle east and Saudi Arabia is our ally that is a challenge that we need to navigate the administration needs to step forward they need any more aggressive or else Congress will act I do believe it I Want to bring\nThe congresswoman in Iran that because I thought what what Senator Paul so it was very interesting which is that we over\nEstimate the importance of Saudi Arabia an underestimate our lab or a job or done that if they if we buy oil from them they sell the oil to us and as he pointed out are there airports was completely uh uh the based on American planes if we held up a weapon and spare parts they'd be grounded than a month\nWell feckless war in Yemen which is the largest humanitarian catastrophe on a planet right now\nUh shows there in capacity as a fighting force ah despite our weapons which may have pay us for and so I Do think we have leverage I wanted to say though that could cause challenging however his name was pronounced was about to be a journalist a scholar at the Wilson Center\nHighly regarded in town and the irony of all of that is that he was writing about the modernization program in a positive way who was critical of\nNBS green extreme behavior but positive about the program and they knew people like him or to apply for direction they're going in and they need the United states\nFinal thought look the Russians trying to kill to people in Great Britain we joined with Britain we put in select the sanctions were pretty severe [noise]\nUh I think just challenging the principle that people can't go around the world killing people is a good thing the president's gonna have to find a way to have a big enough hammer the selective in Rio\nAll the people can relax and say we're going we're getting the right signal through to them for the Congress will react with even bigger and more in a way it could really damaged the relationship\nOr a penalty will uh will see a little bit later in the program\nUp next we're going to take a look at one of the closest Senate races in the country the battle for the open seat in Arizona [noise] we'll talk with Republican candidate and congresswoman Martha McSally about key issues that are contracts including library caravan headed for the U.S [noise]\nLeave that number of people that are being trafficked by the cartels taking advantage of the loop holes in our laws so that they know they're going to be released right into the interior of the United states never to show up for their court date and this is not going to where he just doesn't isn't working on my bill that I worked really closely with the White House on\nClosing loopholes only Congress can do it so the minister Asian can enforce the law and make sure that we secure our border unifying issue across Arizona\nCongresswoman before you supported what was known as the good lab bill you supported another bill and twenty Fifteen your opponent says that you're on all sides of this issue because of the bill you supported in twenty Fifteen\nYou opposed the funding DACA and in fact you supported a path to citizenship for the dreamers so what about the argument for some sort of a mix that you've been inconsistent on those social\nChris you understand the legislative process I been consistently leading on this issue as the border security subcommittee chair there isn't a difficult issue but when the president kicked doctor to Congress appropriately we work together Goodlatte McCall Labrador and myself to lead to identify a solution\nThat secure the border clothes in the legal loopholes moon us more towards a merit based system an does something on DACA this is what we worked on to bring to the floor unfortunately we couldn't get it that's what we're going to keep working on it because it's border still needs to be secured these loopholes still need to be close\nAnd I'm going to continue to lead on that is when I'm In the Senate even though Washington DC moves on to other topics we still have to address this issue\nCongresswoman ... thanks for joining us and of course we'll be following the returns from Arizona on election night\nThanks a lot of grass [laughter]\n\nWhen I go Michelin star as a lifetime achievement in for most shops but one man who was already done that is more focus now on\n\nWearing

retirement goals are unattainable you come to the right place it's time to wake up to reality [noise]\nThe team it from your advisors he's here to help you learn how to grow and protect your wealth retirement planning is more than just a collection of investments are soliciting up new retirement reality storage now hello everybody and welcome to the program\nVisitors new retirement reality because it's more than just investments with the great team from from mere advisors joining me on the program\nAs always right here in Cedar Rapids is where you can find them what they are on the corner of columns in the avenue there that's where they are often this but do not print they service all along the court or from Cedar Falls to Waterloo to I was sitting all points in between you can hear a voice the team at premier advisors can give you a hand\nAnd joining me on the program today is financial advisor Marty willing Bork and certified financial planner Tony gave\nEight four four four to four plan that's your number to call the talk with the team get yourself on the calendar for no cause\nNo obligation consultation aid for for for two for plan a guinea for for for two for playing well let's go ahead and dive into our conversation talking about legacy planning to start off the program today you know a lotta times guys when we discuss legacy planning be kind of mentioned it at the tail end\nOf another segment or some other conversation we're having so let's put a little time here today about seven eight minutes or so here on legacy planning\nI think most of us realize that it's usually best to have an estate planning attorney helped but there are state plan but I think it's also important people to realize the financial advisor I should be a part of that conversation so typically what kind of role to you guys play in that scenario\nWell we do a lot in terms of doing our prep work talking with the clients kind of hashing out brainstorming ideas\nYou need an attorney in order to create you know will or trust the legal documentation but the concepts of all the things we've seen with the multiple multiple decades of experience we have as an office really plays a role in helping a person when they go to that attorney be bought more efficient in that\nConversation and and not pick up as much with the attorneys time and hopefully save themselves money doing that as well\nSo we do a lot of you know what do you want this a state plan to look like\nA lot of like I said brainstorming prep work\nWe also play a role in the implementation or you know there's going to be some investments\nUsually or or some sort of accept involved in terms of that state plan and then we also play a role is the follow up in terms of monitoring you know if we've got a plan in place that we did all the prep work for we've implemented it we want to make sure it stays in place and does exactly what our clients are looking for it to do\nWell Tony hit a lot of the key points mark but uh I think some other things that we want to take care of his focus not every client we meet right off the bat wants to start with estate planning so as we acquire clients and work with them through the years we maintain that focused\nThe recliner we meet right off the bat wants to start with the state planning so as we acquire clients and work with them through the years we've maintained that focus that some day you're going to need probably some type of estate planning\nSo we want to keep the focus their we help you stay organized with that Tony alluded to having a plan together so when it does come time that you say hey we we might want to start looking at a state planning will have the organization I'll put in place for you\nThere's four of us in the office here with the Hundred Years' experience so we have a lot of knowledge\nWorking with a lot of estate planning attorneys like Tony said too is they don't know all the strategies\nThey know the legal part but the strategies and the knowledge to implement some of these solutions for folks that is what we do a lot of our time so it's good to have them things in front of a client and working as a team here to help her clients\nWell this is new retirement reality we're talking about legacy planning here with Tony and Marty here on the program a four four four to four plan the guys what are some basic mistake that you often see people making in the estate planning strategy is there a few key points that you see people trip over fairly regularly\nOr getting to know them a little better and they get to know us but that really help I think a and Tony I think you'd agree to that that really helps build that trust basis correct\nNo absolutely I mean people don't really\nSometimes understand how important that produce your standard is it's a it's not only are\nYou doing what suitable is doing or you have a ethic and moral obligation to put your client's interest ahead of your own that's you know what it boils down to so it's a pretty heavy responsibility but it's also real important when you're dealing with somebody's a assets\nWealth of the folks have some context guy so when you're a ... year which you guys are um uh go ahead and say that in there and like you said you're putting the clients needs and things that the head of your own you have a moral and ethical obligation to do so so ... so that people have some context\nCan you just give me a quick example of what type of advisors typically have ... duty versus maybe someone who doesn't look\nSure mark and it's it's tough to tell you can't look at somebody by the clothes they're wearing masks and they were leaving the office there in a fiduciary duty is typically with a certain securities licensing one of those are the most common one is a series sixty five or sixty six which isn't advisors license\nSo the differences and it's very thin line but the differences between giving guidance versus giving advice you know saying here are three stocks or you can choose from\nYou know here's the information on it versus here's with researching choose from you should choose this one or that one\nYou know it it's kind of the the definition of what you're helping somebody to do there are also professional designations that also carry the fiduciary standard as well in order to hold that designation they example is the certified financial planner designation that I have\nYou know it it does require a fiduciary standard as well whether you have that series sixty five or sixty six license so it could come through the actual securities industry licensing or could come through additional designations that you work and have a a ethical responsibility or ...\nAnd I think Tony hit it right on the head there mark is that we work very hard around here to keep her self educated and of course being ethical in that manner to make sure is right for everybody [noise] long time ago um I was told by a veteran agent years ago he says when you explain things to folks when it comes investments or\n... or life insurance he said make sure you could explain it to your grandmother so she would understand\nYou are right and I always kind of taken at the heart because uh my grandmother how bless her soul but she was a a good old German farm gal boy and I tell you she had to know everything [laughter] where she'd move for anything and then the other factor is that you love your grandmother to make sure\nYou're explaining everything to him so that they fully understand okay\nSo you know we're talking about the fiduciary standard here on the program this is the newer time it reality it's more than just investments with a team from premier advisors and as Tony mentioned you know as a certified financial planner the team is a fiduciary they are loose here standard they live up to that and it's putting the needs of the client above their and their own most morally and ethically\nAnd if you have questions and concerns about you know the situation that year and the people that you're working with or whatever you can reach out to the team and we'll talk with him and ate\nFor for for two for planets eight four four four to four plant or you can check out your own advisor on broker Chek dot ... dot org and that's another way you could kind of\nI'll look into some things broker Chek dot ... dot org but again a lot of times has had that conversation it's OK to ask they argue with a new theory when you're sitting down and talking with someone again a four four four to four plan a guys can you give us an example of some advice that you've given someone from that produce Uri perspective where they would have likely ...\nDo you for playing a guys can you give us an example of some advice that you've given someone from that fiduciary perspective where they would have likely gotten different advice from someone who wasn't a fiduciary\nMark 'em let me give me an example we work with helping to position people's money where it's appropriate for their goals and their risk tolerance\nAnd part of that is developing plans that allow them some flexibility down the road\nWith where they're going to pull some money out you know you've got a growth assets for example that you may draw upon when times are good and the stock market and you may have some protection assets that are better to draw upon when markets aren't doing so well what's your market investments recover well\nPart of a building that type of structure is specifically identify insecurities to sell from the growth side and move them to the protected side and a lot of cases because most people are focused one they're working on grow grow grow not protect\nSo a lot of cases we developed these plans were were specifically identifying a investments to sell to move into a other security's like just give me an example sell some stocks and move it into maybe a a fixed indexed annuity if it's appropriate for the client\nWell in that circumstance you I think it's important to act as if we do share 'cause you want to sell the rights securities\nAnalyze those you want to make sure it's done tax sufficiently if it's not you know within an IRA account you want to know the tax implications there\nAnd three you want to make sure that we are moving that money into that protected asset is legitimately going to work for the client their needs and what they're a liquidity issues are we run into circumstances\nHere in town unfortunately and and you know in the surrounding area where you've got insurance individuals who are not licensed at all with securities don't have any for Sherry obligation there who are selling people security or recommending they sell securities and putting them into these products\nAnd it made me the right thing for the client maybe\nBut it's not the right thing to do from um a regulatory standpoint if you don't have the proper licenses you're not being held responsible for that half of the equation you can't really be held responsible for half of what you're doing ... you have to be responsible for the whole thing would you agree Mari\nAgree a hundred percent I mean you know I Know where the heart is but I'm sure you don't want me doing heart surgery on you and you know you had to make sure that it that you're connected with all that stuff and given the right advice for the right person but\nA lot of times we see folks too that are just moving money to move money and a lot of our listeners acts up visiting right yup makes them look busy and or if you're going to sit there all day and just move money from here to there guess who make some money on that well it's usually the person moving the money\nSo you you want to be careful that uh we we have a lot of our clients if we recommend that they move any money or do some different strategies\nThe first question out of their mouth should be ... or why am I doing now what's the strategy behind that and then explain it to them like I said earlier explained it like you're explaining to your grandmother so you want to make sure that you do that well so that they understand everything\nBut we'd like to do is make an offer if he called us in the next Fifteen minutes we're going to custom designed for you and easy to understand financial review and that will help indicated if you're really in need of a full blown financial plan\nThere's not going to be any obligation or costs for this initial review at all and callers who have at least a hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nWe'd be glad to do that for you so if you meet these qualifications here's what she can expect first will run out the report to help you untangle what his caution you to work with your current plan or or your advisor\nWill show you how to protect your investments that keep more of your money in your accounts and not the advisors next we'll reform attacks analysis the show you how you could possibly reduce your taxes\nAnd increase your cash flow we spent some time on that earlier that's very very important and finally it will create a customized a lifetime income plan using proven strategies and techniques\nThat could really terrible charger retirement income in short will take the guess where it out of your financial planning for you so if you call in the next Fifteen minutes we'll have a comprehensive financial review\nThat we're offering with no obligation on your part and they number there is aid\nFor for for two for planned aid for for for two four\nSeven five to six and again that number's eight for for for two for planned eight for for\nFor two for planned to talk with the team at premier advisors\nAnd have that conversation about your own retirement journey and go through that process and understand a little more about that the DC area standards of the guys operate under and I do really want to say real fast that you know just because someone is required to operate under the fiduciary standard doesn't necessarily mean they're trying to steal people's money or do something nefarious but you just want to make sure\nThat you're working with the right kind of person with the right type of a credentials if you will for the situation that you want to be in and I think for the fiduciary standard it's it's one of those things where I don't know we should have passed a law to make that responsible people put\nTheir clients needs ahead of their own so that's just me I think that's something that all people probably want to work with someone in that similar situation so if you've got questions concerns you'd like to reach out to the team and have that conversation go ahead eight four four four to four plant a for for for two for planned to talk with Todd Marty Jason and Tony on their own financial advisors\nAnd tell me even certified financial planner from me or advisors this is new retirement around and get more than just investment

can certainly help you out Cedar Falls Iowa City Waterloo all points in between\nAnd Tony likes to say have car will travel so get yourself on the counter he might write out there and talk with you as well say eight four four four to four plan\nThat's the number to call to make it happen eight four four\nFour to four plan you can also check him out on line learn a little bit more about the team at premier advisors L. L. C. dot com as premier advisors L. L. C. dot com the teams got more than a hundred years of combined experience between the four of them so great great resource to tap into here in the area eight four four\nFour to four plant guys I tease that we were going to talk about science of good financial health will certainly would like to have good regular health right so why not have a good financial health\nAs well so I got a couple of categories here a couple of things for you and I think make pretty good sense and you can kind of elaborate on them you might have good financial health if you're spending less than you make certainly as a retiree but I think that's good advice for all of life really\nMark absolutely I mean one of the primary rules\nIn developing a financial plan is to make sure somebody has a emergency fund in place you know some cash so they don't have to\nWorry about taking on that if a unforeseen circumstances crops up that they need some additional money and the only way you can do that is by making sure that you spend less than you make otherwise you're not saving anything so\nIt isn't a magic investment it isn't a magic stock that you're picking you know all of a sudden you held it for Thirty years and you're a billionaire I'm sure that can happen but it's rare the key to successful planning for anything to buy anything is to making sure that you spend less than you make\nBut it's especially important in retirement and doing it early\nBecause the earlier you do it the earlier develop those habits the more time your money has to compound and grow and with more money you get more options you can make things a lot more tax efficient again you just have to have the mindset to not take on that\nAnd part of that is you know your investments in the market might go up might go down right depending on what you put it into\nBut if you acquire debt you're guaranteeing yourself all last with whatever the interest rate is on that debt even if it's a low interest rate credit cards high interest loans those things are killers for people for their financial plan because you're guaranteeing whatever that interest rate you know ten Fifteen Percent is a guaranteed loss each year\nOkay so another sign of good financial health may be that you understand the future tax implications of your savings you kind of touched on this a little bit earlier and I'm not saying folks out there don't have to know all the nuts and bolts right but they need to have at least an understanding of those future tax implications to be a good sign of financial health\nYeah I think there's a greater degree of knowledge you can say whether it's the amount of media or Internet or whatever but I think there's people are taking a lot more active stance and what their money is doing and see if you know professionals you know such as ourselves and that type of thing but\nMost people look at the future tax implications as yeah I Know I'm gonna have to pay taxes I for one carry if I've got an IRA Amano taxes down the line some people realize it at age Seventeen and a half there is required minimum distributions\nThat can catch some people by surprise or to be honest with you people don't want to think that far down the down the road that's something that we do to let people know that they're educated\nAnd a lot of people know about a rough Irish you know the fact that you can pull money out completely tax free and there may be strategies\nTo convert money into those but what a lot of people don't give a lot of future attacks implication part two is\nHealth savings accounts and the savings that you can get there by building up during your working years five to nine plans for your kids' education and the tax savings that are there and the portability to be able to move it from one child to another of the first child\nTo nine plans for your kids' education and the tax savings that are there and the portability to be able to move it from one child to another of the first child doesn't use it all up and a lot of people are not very familiar with the IRS tax code not get that it can it\nCan sometimes and stuff like that right well you know not a lot of people sit\nDown and say let me start reading through the tax code unless they're having trouble going to sleep at night but you know there is a portion of the tax code that can allow you to sell investments and pay no taxes on the games\nDepending on your income tax level and your capital gains racket picture and then and a lot of people don't realize there is a way to structure withdrawals from your assets\nThat can have little to no tax implications\nWell sticking on the tax thing here mark too is I think that you got to take a look at work taxes going if you look at today's world I think for every dollar the government takes and they spend a dollar forty three the last time I saw\nOnly Allen thirty [laughter] yeah well we we we look at that but boy I'm just afraid down the road and it might be sooner than we expect but they're gonna have to start raising taxes on some of this stuff and\nAnd we said here differing everything differing everything so the day we retire than a bang or all of a sudden the tax rates are way up there ... do you wish you would have had a lot of different strategy so\nWe try to take a look at an advance if that happens to protect yourself a little bit by a you know covering some things in that getting some tax free and come out of these things Tony ... talking about but that's one of the biggest things that I think that it's not even hidden anymore but I think that's coming down the road and I don't think we can avoid that\nWell you know we're talking about science of good financial health I think that's a good point money that you make because they you know we've I've heard it said you know people are saying well taxes are kind of on sale right now in ... who knows how long they're going to be\nAt this potential area from the new tax plane that went through so yeah you would think that at some point they've got to go up so it certainly wise to have these conversations but if you want to talk about your own financial health and you'd like to talk with the team and see if the signs are good for you in are working well for you and if you need to make some minor tweaks or adjustments\nWell the team it from your advisors is here to help you a four four four to four plan eight four four four to four plan that your number to call one more here real fast guys before we step out for a commercial break\nAnd I know this one's really important to you guys and the collective team\nAnd a sign of good financial health would be if you're married both you and your spouse you need to know enough about their retirement plan to be able to manage if something happens to the other one again not maybe necessarily the nuts and bolts and the super nitty gritty but have a good understanding so that if something happens to one of you\nThe other one is not left behind the eight ball and I know that's very important to you guys\nWell it is to all of us here myself personally to that\nUh I make my wife of good beneficiary and God Forbid something happens to me she knows right where everything's at I got a nice binder and she just pull that out that tells her exactly what to do she doesn't like it too often but maybe once every six to eight months I'll sit down with their\nAnd ah I Know it sounds morbid mark but I just said hey I didn't make it home that night what are you going to do right and well and and it sounds kind of goofy but you know I Know it's a great point yeah\nI've been doing it for thirty five thirty six years you know when your spouse has gone you sort of have some decisions made here when they're here and not when they're they're gone and you have to make them on your own anyway so I kinda tester on some of that and she's gotten very good at that\nKnowing where they should go and that should go and how big a party she should throw in all of that [laughter] but she does cover all that and that's hard because my wife is not in the finances and like a lot of our clients or spouses sometimes aren't into that\nBut they sure would like to know where to go now I'm fortunate to have my son here and two of my best friend's Tony and Todd here\nThat God Forbid something ever happened to me um my wife shirt could uh come in here and talk to them after a she's gone through what she thought it was necessary but I think that that's just crucial to make your uh spouses good beneficiaries\nFair market it's something we do see fairly often usually it's one spouse takes the lead man or woman doesn't you know there's no specific there but I'm a one spouse usually takes the lead on kind of the finances of the household\nAnd it's good that the other person is involved in the process especially when they sit down with us so they're more comfortable it's important to have it written plan and it was important to have that written plan just like Marty said in a safe place and if the very least if you do have a financial planning professional involved in your lives\nBut if you do spend less than you make and you do have a knowledge of tax implications in the future on your savings and both parties understand the retirement plan you have the retirement income plan that the guy just talking about well then maybe you won't have to worry too much about your financial future and that's our final sign of good financial health\nIf you have these things in place you might be okay and if not well that's where you guys coming\nOh absolutely mark you know it's tough to find somebody who doesn't have at least some worry about their financial future so if you came in and said I've got no worries [laughter]\nThat's going to want I'm either going to be real happy you got it all figured out or to you don't know what you don't know there are things that you haven't considered that maybe we need to bring up that second opinion like Marty mentioned\nSo it's important to us to make sure people are comfortable with their financial future I don't know if there'll be completely worry free but it should be stress free\nOr that's the whole point of retirement you put in all this time to work or you should be able to do what you want to do and retirement and not stress out about it when when you say ...\nYeah I think that's the other half of the mark and Tony is are people worried about their financial future and we know it kind of stress that puts on every body so we want to take the worry off the table\nI Can't go back to the uh the guaranteed income that sure takes a lot of my wife and my worry is off the table just sitting down and and making sure that that's all going to be there but I think and Tony I don't know if you disagree or not but um you know a lot of our callers that that we have coming in and we sit down and we talk with them\nI'm pleasantly surprised that a lot of them do have plans that they have stuff kind of put together and then we just helping them tweak it a little bit and I feel so much better now than than years ago when people had no idea what was going on so congratulations to a lot of the folks out there\nThat have come in and talk to us or want to talk to us you are putting together some good retirement plans out there and\nI think second opinion is getting to be one of the biggest things we have right now\nYeah and Marty wouldn't you say also may be a turning point is when people come in and say ... I've seen this happened I'm sure you have as well\nPeople come in and say well I'm going to spend it and if there's something left the kids can have a bit later down the road after they're done a lot of the things checked off their bucket list and retirement they start thinking about it and saying you know what\nMaybe I Will start thinking about that legacy ... you know I'm now comfortable enough to know that I can continue to do what I Want to do in retirement and I actually I'm going to have a little bit of extra so let me put together\nA plan for that you were saying that to\nWhere she had quite a bit of that as far as the legacy planning a because again take a little access I get talked about before\nYou really only have three buckets airs charity and the IRS and they never ah pick the IRS naturally but uh most of that go into the air so we really sit down and help them set down and do some of that there are so you know get them awake and a little bit to to what's all out there and they really appreciate that but folks uh you've got to understand we're\nReally passionate about our community being well prepared for retirement\nAnd we want to extend an offered you right now to help you be sure that you're well prepared so we're going to offer a complementary financial review to you if you call and the next Fifteen minutes and have at least a hundred thousand dollars save for retirement we'll talk about your retirement income needs were that income is going to come from\nHow you're gonna outpaced inflation\nPay as little as possible probably on taxes and make sure that you don't outlive your money that's one of the crucial issues right there now you might say I don't really have to call the next Fifteen minutes in the ass it's true you could probably take care of it next week or next month\nBut here's the deal we've been coaching people on retirement planning for a long time and we've learned that it's really easy to procrastinate\nOr get distracted so if you don't start the process now there's probably a pretty good chance\nYou're not going to do it at all so the first coaching tip that we'd like to give is that we're going to encourage you to take the first step right now for almost everybody that's the hardest part from there it's really not a very painful process Saudi ready to finally get a plan in place give us a call right now\nAt a four four four to four plan our aid for for for two four\nSeven five to six\nAnd that number again as we depart the program today for for a four to four plan called that number get yourself on the counter talking about some of these things we've discussed today on the show great show what the team from premier advisors talking about a lot of assets to uh the retirement journey that we're all on at some point we're all heading that direction and whether it's legacy\nPlanning we we discuss the fiduciary standard uh some signs of good financial help the team at premier advisors can help you with all of these things as well as wealth management and investing tax strategy so on and so forth to reach out to them complimentary review is yours to be had by simply calling a four four\nFour to four plan at ... for for a four to four plant called that number get yourself on the calendar and have a great conversation with the team and\nMake sure that your retirement journey is going to be one that hopefully even vision and you can get there and work those plans together and get that gold set a four four four to four plan that the number to call to make it happen\nWill do it all again next time right here on new retirement reality it's more than just investments with premier advisors eight or ... or to Ford plant [noise]\nSecurities and investment advisory services are offered ... investment Corp a icy ... representatives of a an icy do not provide tax or legal advice please consult your tax adviser or attorney regarding your situation\nWe interrupt regular programming to bring you this live University of northern Iowa sporting event on the home of the Panthers news talk Fifteen forty K.

really you didn't take the course of them how to conduct a marching band [laughter]\nYeah it is\nUm no this was out at least you didn't take the course of them how to conduct a marching band [laughter]\nYeah it is I couldn't I don't mean to do that and um I told them there was no way to do that [laughter]\nSo do you have to find something else to do that kind of funny I I just wanted to do um\nI just beat it back to my mind because I switched the biochemistry the bike departments for the purpose of the study and he saw it was clear what I wanted to do\nTo to universal disease right aging yes everybody right [laughter] [noise]\nYeah I felt that it was just like there are\nNo longer much I mean there's lots of people who work at it but it remains unknown field you know back then I'm and I'm In every ... people were ... people dead is they're not on the fact that most of the car when you're older\nAnd I'm In saw yeah I thought those of trading desk I'm saying is a challenge but also an incredible opportunity for medicine\nWhat year was that volunteer\nIn Nineteen eighty\nYou suddenly had garter I mean you actually were way ahead of the curve did did you have colleagues or other people in that in science and medicine like kind of shaking their head wondering might buy you thought this was so important\nActually went all the way to almost my my uh UCLA and we pretty much had to hide the fact that we're working on it and everybody thought it was\nJust dumb [laughter]\nSince I have right now it's almost like soup pricing to say but uh yeah we we we will say something else you would never say work in a\nIt was you know they're going to be seeing a he'll change but the only way to push undergraduate or Amanda ... years but also UCLA remake the year\nIt was like a shot the sub the field that was not that interesting or or certainly English so complex and in a certainty that no one took it seriously\nWhen one now it's like all their age so I you know I Know we're gonna have to go to a break stay inside I Want to get started on this topic I might have to cut you off in the longevity die you base your recommendations on five pillars longevity maybe you can give us the first one before we got to break\n[noise] first one is certainly a basic research my six set ourselves focused on getting in and help the longevity\nIt's taking the basic sciences than uh you know what you find out in the research lab and so you're using that as one of the pillars to support to not just diet is is a form of age management but as a way to prevent disease or disease prevention\n[noise] what is not just about diet site about dry about Jean about drugs\nSo it's going to lead to say I did the beach and three months later\nAnd look great but um it's much much much more important to say if I ... for three months and then the next to this person going to leave long and healthy\nAnd that's something that you can only from basic research right now because you can do a a human\nBeings are thinking about that but certainly in my case is a relief to human clinical trials with Jamie ... so you have to read I say for example if I Do a fast even if they're going to make a mouse longer and healthier\nAnd hopefully they will not hold that thought that we got to go to a break when we come back we're going to pick up right there for our listeners where I'm a volunteer long ago he's got an amazing book you need to pick it up the longevity diet we'll be right back [noise]\nThey do show and remember you can reach us by other when they're young Americans are more calls for for a one on\nMe that brings in putting your body like in jeopardy or wheel tired [noise] do you think\nThey said the one that is one of the fact\nThat there are about of course I always say you can do it right you can measure with the science data\n... lots of things that I Would say that but like for example is that they can record so we and the long but we you know they know that\nRight so why why do you why do you think they're weak is it the lack of as mobility or black\nOr protein Lin later years\nMaybe maybe that could be a lot of them may not keep that we need to eat\nA lot you know for example not famous or more or I should they compare southern you look at the older you know after\nThat I stay home all the right there and a big change in you know you ... you know they're in early on they they don't eat\nMuch will even as they don't do much\nSo yeah so that she can make an inch and [noise] so yeah so you want from the actions he took that say that they want to find that come and get the same mechanical work\nSay okay it makes sense to be something that I liked it\nAnd it's like up to my [noise]\nSo I you know some people say you gotta eat five or six times a day I I I don't think you agree with that haven't read your book but at well how many hours a day should we plan on eating and how many hours a day so they plan on fasting\nThe way it should be twelve in all\nThe problems in Mali bathrooms and longer you start seeing profit for example Goldstone or me and the need for gold let people know that ... day\nLet's wait and all\nThe heavy topic that's one of them on the one I mean it's bad for the day is keep\nMultiple studies you want me to write and showing that into worse and worse or for worse for all showing me something what reason I'm not saying that\nThat necessarily because they I mean that's one thing that you can eat it should not have that you know fast yeah\nOkay I got to let you go I got to tell our listeners pick up the longevity a diet dive alter long ago and there's so much we didn't even get to about pencil activation and all kinds of things you got to pick it up it's a great read we'll be right back

kind of do an improv\nYes on that right and we never read it if you couldn't tell so I took that also get you probably know Bob and ray but if you do you'll hear like I figure if they they did this to fifty years\nAnd sometimes broke up while they were doing it we could do that too and that's sometimes what happens with the audience here is that we're having fun hopefully there have been listening as well um so that's what we did that come from the barbecue guy in the end the fondue I think\nYou were just you were brand thing about something\nI think if you just ranting as Doug about cooking or barbecuing something and so it was just totally innocent and\nYou know I kinda like that ran in your voice took on a different tone and attitude and and I think that's where the barbecue guy gr I said that's a good character someone that comes on and talks about cooking about barbecuing and you just took it in you ran with it it was great\nYeah I got permission to do it the almost you know like basically right who's you need to get you need to get\nThrough all of a wall of self consciousness when you're doing improbable you're doing that kind of\nThing and and and not try to be funny that's another thing I I you know like rush 'cause a lot of time to go over to try to before and it just never works that way I don't know if it's funny I'm not saying but I don't we don't go for a little joke so punch line's\nA boat that was when we did our half hour show in the beginning and really just trying to fill out what what's up for you to give you the permission to do with it and go along as a\nStraight person the first time was just barbecue guy\nAnd then we went to a after that if I'm doing a lot of fun to do which is more or less an odd couple I suggested to do that yeah\nI mean that would that rate unless you're a little of the now fondue guy imitating barbecue got a ...\nI'm going to read it like barbecue\nGuide for the ... don't forget the skill you understand the scale is I'm Talking about skew is here you got two roles a skill that I wrote it was a guy yeah you got\nTo write Bush from ripe mutt from ... from nan is ripe for going to have to have you like to find new guy let's see what\nThe fun to get a response to take [laughter] I Know I Know what I think a bag marshmallows marshmallow and they'll have a headache and you basically put her on the floor you start with both feet throw it on a barbecue and there you\nGo that doesn't sound that does not sound very advertising to me I'd like to have a glass of wine some boos your little a and a little fun do and that's all I Would like uh can\nI say that it's the most intelligent statement I've ever heard you speak but I like is that by the barbecue guy has still kept the accent a imitating a great guy and he's a great while he was right [laughter] well what does it come from and then I loved them\nBut if the barbecue guy has still kept his accent\nA imitating a great guy and he's a great while he was right [laughter] well what does it come from and then I Love the way find do or they just goes the it's like an odd couple they just naturally you feed off each other and and all of that is just total like you just started doing it and we let we jumped on there\nYou know I feel like it or not I hope you like it but that's fun for us and really that's the important it's\n... I think if you're having fun hopefully the the person I was listening to our show is having fun so hopefully I Will make of radio can only hope right exactly as if you'd like to let us know yes or no feel free to let us know yeah listen if you don't like it will stop doing it right well maybe they will dot com\nWe will do it at less frequently is yeah that's it the old new again at AOL dot com now he was just a little intro to marry backstage as we go out\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K. IRA or investment accounts\nAnd I have one word and my advice stop many experts warn of a stock market crash any day now and if it's anything like the last two crashes you could lose fifty percent or more of your heart or and savings in a Wall Street gives you know can you afford to lose happier\n\n\nThat's a good one that happened I think we just had the argument you love to have in in the times and talking to you go if\nThat's one of our a pitch lines is that we like to have the argument you love to have you on everything oldest again and so again just trying to take some changes one instead of just doing the street so when you hear the radio now it's so a\nPretty straightforward and easy to talk about sports or talking about medicine or we're talking about politics or what else is there are you hearing music\nYeah they're all like they're scripted with a point of view and very succinct an end to the point our show the exact opposite [laughter]\nWe're we're a simple to a ... degree of one of the percentage of of curb your enthusiasm in that but when he was stand that they they just set up he uses a general idea of what the scene is go and they ... they do it for his Asian and most of the\nTheir you know I'm sure they throw a lot out we we don't feel anything out uh\nI like to just comparing as a curb your enthusiasm that cycle writes a very bold\nI said one per se but I think it's an instead of even less than it is but ah who just say it's analogous to I could\nSum and says I'm university and I'm thinking like it\nAnd if enough of you actually start spreading the word about our show maybe we will be the next curb on the radio that's right ah well we are the next curb but we're not recognize when we need more\nEarly in our own moral yes and our own world and we are the next and speaking of our own world we had this\nCharacter just kept in this ... kept him ... yes that kept him from the old old old old old days and that's\nA a pirate that we didn't think works way back when the first time we did it and he's come on twice since since I think it works out pretty well so let's just listen to have some\nMay [noise]\nOkay what does that get the balls I didn't

impression is that it's not a sticky thing that's been done a million times [laughter]\nAnd I know it was your your wife has said on the air when she's visited us but she hates captain both ... and she explained why\nWell I think subliminally there's a message I should be thinking about it in a while I think for the reason I just said it's sticky and she said when she first heard it's cute right that that doesn't fly without\nA doubt now that's that's the very polite way of my wife saying are you kidding me [laughter] immediately I Am no longer listening when you don't have a character on but we we've had him back we we teens him actually\nWith jak pumpkin had oh right which was right next section who the heck that is and jak pumpkin had has taken as a life on onto him his own as well and
