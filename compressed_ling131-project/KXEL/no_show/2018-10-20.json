a lot easier to make films out there so it's interesting to see that what they do you know you're in Canada but you're trying to recreate Iowa\nI mean as long as you get some corn shots in there that might be enough to satisfy some people but it's like\nI said three eighty about a two lane road each side or just other things like that right plus that year was interesting because it said of the U.S

two more remaining after this late start but we get to stop watch going to see how long it'll take [noise]\nThat was interesting I could definitely believe that it didn't touch anything they get Mike

[laughter] you sound like the flights that David his email [laughter] di\n... says this is horrible for you it really is horrible for everyone listening is can you walk around or will you be stepping on the high just stuck\nTo the poll oh now before and now\nThe technology we used to create a large person in the small person is just it's unprecedented\nGet pretty much put we put out like I don't know a hands or a mouse I think is what we do yeah [laughter] and then a little better there but\nBut again ... hopefully you're enjoying it if you're not let us know but this was just explaining to use some times\nThe thought behind why we uh we do this and we were doing like the lack of thought that we were doing a New Year's show we wanted to say we're at\nNew Years you know in times square this is another one coming out for one now different time where we were in New York Times square and we were going down to a a reporter Johnny Jones on the spot on the spot reporter and he was interviewing one of the people waiting for the ball to\nHandle a female voice Bob and ray that female voices and have a six hours is a reason\nI Want to say Hi Sally mayor I\nWanted to bring Sally this is the problem are real estate and actually I think in my case someone in trouble and already I don't know\nI've been there for the last twelve hours and we've become very good friends\nThere you go so we're actually not in times square I'm sure that's pretty obvious wow I thought we were [laughter] and then later on the show we we uh ... if you didn't redo this I don't know if\nEveryone got the joke that the whole thing was a set up to one joke where are our reporters down at Times Square\nAnd he's so involved and they can't go to the bathroom these freezing cold he doesn't know why is there is miserable and he just rants about that and the whole point of being down there is to get beyond beyond the feel of the ball dropping and the crowd screaming for the new year and this is what happens\nOn I don't know why even down here what's the point of oldest\nJohnny, Johnny he was just happy just miss the entire thing can't believe we miss\nWe we got a reporter Johnny he's still there\nI'm going home [laughter] a little short but so\nWhat he I I forget he was ranting and raving about how miserable he was down there you have to have you have all these people have either one I'll drive right behind yeah he can\nDo if you missed that show that was on New Year's show of of last year two thousand Eighteen um and then we had a a these are like one time kind of characters if you will get Bruce banner visit\nWe did a show huh yeah Tomahawk yeah and this just came out of out of nowhere mostly a a David Cohen's imagination of the temperament\nOf what a Bruce than it would be excited thought that being a superhero it'd be exciting and and something that would bring a agreed on beyond to the show and this is what we got to tell us how that was that's like\nDude my life is miserable I never know when to alter ego will kick in so I Can't have a girlfriend I Can't have a family so what kind of relationship could you ever had with anyone ... when when the prospect of turning into this monster and killing them is always present\n[laughter] you know this kind of brought this show to a screeching although and there's a reason these are one time heritage\nAgain not trying to hide the voice or anything uh just hoping you enjoyed it is one where we did a call in show a new on um April Fools and we were trying to see if we had this one recurring characters\nWere pitching were pitching show ideas are\nCallers would call in pitching show ideas right and we had this one character from ah Chicago that kept on calling in with ideas of shows that we'd already done rather than a million of them and then finally you know more about the I don't know oh this was his an ID talks about a UFO show okay\nI Want to hear from the perspective but then they asked [laughter] yeah I Want to hear from that perspective I understand this toy thanks up your follows I watch the dentist to be alive in the studio and I'm calling in what do you think it can you pull that off we\nCan we've had a dentist Dr John Vivian any on I think five times he's been on many times since then it's probably been on a I Would say ten times altogether\nDr John to be any on I think five times he's been on many times since then it's probably been on a I Would say ten times the leaks now the ... it was just funny to hear us or you mock a hour or would you say St\nResident you if you follow junior follow just everything all this new again than actual there and this is ...\n... and so that that you can laugh about cells that it's always good to get a good doctor sure a lot with that and by the way we do have lots of a UFO shows or to listen to we we do them all the factual everything that we present does\nBut you know presented as facts and we've got clips and tapes and things but we do with a little smile to try to pass the time has fun with it but I'm along those lines we had a show we did Tarzan\nAnd this is not really a coward to put just taking changes what we're doing with the rate of just try to why New Horizons to make things fun a David tried to imitate till they both did actually the Tarzan yell how nice show and I'm going to try one more time Earl right there\n\n\nIs a good one that up and I think we just had the argument you love to have in in the times in talking\nTo you go that's one of our a pitch lines is that we liked to have the argument you love to have you on everything all this new again and so again just trying to take some changes one as soon as you sort of St Joe when you hear the radio now it's so a\nPretty straightforward and it's easy to talk about sports or talking about medicine well we're talking about politics or what else is there are you hearing music\nYeah but I don't like their scripted where the point of view and very succinct an end to the point our show the exact opposite [laughter]\nWe're we're a ... degree ... won the percentage of of curb your enthusiasm in that but when he was then did they they just set up he used a general idea of what the scene is go and they ... they do it for his Asian and most of the\nTheir you know I'm sure they throw a lot out we we don't throw anything out uh\nI like to do comparing as to curb your enthusiasm that cycle writes a very bold\nHe's the one percent I use it and that was your homes even less than a percentage but who just sitting at the end now just to I could\nSum and as I'm university I'm thinking like it\nAnd if enough of you actually start spreading the word about our show maybe we will be the next curb on the radio that's right uh well we are the next ... but we're not recognize when we need\nMore early in our own moral yes and our own world and we are the next and speaking of our own world we had this\nCharacter just kept in this ... kept him ... yes a captain from the old old old old old days and that\nA five or six shows something like that yeah that always the entire not often [laughter] and and but hopefully you're enjoying it and now we had a little different take later on we had a the Invisible Man talking to Dracula when we do I think it was a Victorian of dangers\nAnd we paid to do that then they turn adventures and the universal monsters against\nI'm against the the Avengers themselves and they had some discussion I was a different Dracula\nA select so I don't know if we recognize that the ... Iraqi all on the show previous go\nI said well what does the entity in the money I was saying has that they're blaming the Abbott and Costello fiasco ... Dracula loss the contest on their behalf and they've never gotten over that ...\nTo ... miles of bloody the I'd taken from me right and I thought you know I Love the trash talk by\nDracula it's great [laughter] so uh I don't know if he was laughing at this stuff besides that was put out its just insanity what goes on to these guys and they was Dracula which voices better\nWhich why like your voice is not the traditional Dracula which I was I was too much on the nose that we\nTalked about that now you said you know he said that you know that voice in Hollywood is not just like Al Capone says you know that's not a reality yeah so um I actually got a little glimpse of that uh when the Bob and ray did\nInterviews with in time and they started interviewing\nA you know a character different presidents Washington and whenever we don't know what their voices well like right so you could just do anything [laughter]\nAnyways and then we we stumbled upon we visited as one time and we stumbled upon a character of jak pumpkin had now ... along the same lines with the Halloween show he then broke in when we had this party this Halloween\nYou stumbled upon a coward of jak pumpkin had now ... along the same lines of the Halloween show he then broke in mood had this party this Halloween party on the air and he was being chased and ...\nBut you should explain who pumpkin headed because I don't think a lot of people out of the character he he's a character that is from the original book by the wizard of Oz was in a couple\nOf books there's a lot of books was a lot of folks right he was a hero and we figured he's the only guy if you look at those the the whole series he's less at odds\nWith all the other ones were presented in the movie itself the wizard of Oz he was not even mentioned it the wizard of Oz he was in some other movies that I mentioned him but he's a character became I said let's do something different with wizard of Oz everyone has talked about the wizard of Oz a great news and all this so we actually visited there\nSo we went to a you went back to the books and found this character they never made it into the you know the famous movie right what what would he be saying we gave him some airtime\nEverybody would be you'd be upset he like there'd be very upset at the ... best of ah you know he's like well I'm left here and he's looking for work it's Seventy years and he's had no work\nAnd so now he's become a a mainstay in some ways a sort of showing areas breaking in a two hour show on Halloween because he was chased by kids a Halloween member he's a being with a pumpkin head yeah my\nPumpkin had yes ... why are you stressed Allen I it's unbelievable I'm depressant jak nowhere in front that's on everybody's\nFront porch of course of their kids chasing you and tries to me because I'm a I'm Alive pumpkin miracle you don't know my wife pumpkin and the pumpkin\nI'd walk around they want to look at my pumpkin had and put it on and I said I'm the president ... on the front porch\nWas an easy to say that tongue in cheek if you are but there he was so that will take a moment here which of these all these characters a come alive to you or do they all I mean any of them fail any of them really work\nWhere do you stand on that media um any of them on the list now I\nI you know what I ... I haven't heard them since we did them and uh didn't really hear them originally other than when you and I hear in the studio are actually doing these ...\nI ... I like all of them I mean they do work because you could spin that disbelief because you're not looking\nAt the people on television do riot that's what's great about radio there and you could just once you get over that ... what is this and they go oh okay and you go with it you can go data pretty fun cool ride with the hose and they do stuff like that I agree um and and I know I'm\nHoward Stern used to back in the day in the NBC days when he was just starting out in New York 'cause he was in Washington before that\nHe did have some characters and did some plays and all that and he then he turned off color as he would do a down the line and then he stopped doing them\nA but he even had a a period there where he thought that it was interesting and fun radio for years and years you would do that I don't know if you remember that\nI don't know how long ago that was\nI don't remember the actually when he started in New York he had a uh every time I Would say something funny he had a drum and assemble oh wow he's the drumming symbol soil came a long way [laughter] now uh now he's he's I don't know how hurt he is\nNow because in Syria's or Israel who'd be hurt a lot but I don't know how many people are listening and get a lot of news the words and and so forth that it's it's not all that a\nListened to any more and it was but um that's a different story for the day but he's one of the leaders in the industry and he started doing these things as well just throwing it out there that right now you know it it is something that's been done many many times by many characters many people and I I don't think it's something that that uh is that far into the radio so\nWe're like Bob and ray where as good as curb your enthusiasm on the radio and and as good as Howard Stern is what we're really trying to say\nI Am actually saying these are our influences was striving to become a modicum of what these people\nWho are now you're you're kind of walking that back over there but OK I'm with you there\nAnd so if you're enjoying it a please feel free to let us know an old\nNew again at AOL dot com if you're not it's old new again at AOL dot com to or something like that where you you don't get that email a old dog and two and they all of that comes with a negative responses are just getting what we would we would love to hear what your thoughts on this regard we'll be back wrote this to\nFinish up talking about all these characters and what's happening on everything ... and over again\n\nI knew I had a problem but I didn't know what to do it\nI tried Carol calorie pills eating and eating a lot\nI really wanted to write nothing could ... at one point so bad\nI don't like getting I felt so alone\nLike nobody has could possibly understand when we're over eaters anonymous and\nWe have helped thousands of people just like here people don't want to adopt a compulsive eating start living healthy rewarding life over eaters anonymous\nHelped me get my life now eating that way that have been\nGood for me I never realized what I was missing out on\nAnd living in\nLiving life either withheld over is not there at college level five eight ... for for sinus on that went into a data learned\n\nOf the Panthers a new song if he's forty ...\nThan it is at first they feel a lot for her and that one\nChris financial I made a Sunday afternoon as your you and I have always all the wealth was Marquette cinema club set and we'll start with the pregame show at one forty five first served as to you and I've always offers Marquette Sunday afternoon on your helmet the Panthers news talk in forty ...

some fun All right so let's keep going with the reason behind your writing this novel\nSo I'm quite a few years ago we were a raw milk and had bought melt added ... and that\nFarmer within a single woman whose husband had died and she was injured head of the people who are buying from her rallied and set at the cat to help her saying the farm and that we had a milk at our house and\nWhere was this within Gloster Rhode Island\nOkay I Know the dominant coast\nRuth man with her name she was well known as a feisty little woman I Believe she was probably close to Seventy when she was still operating in this family and we were buying milk from pat I'm Seth so and\nI continue to work at dairy farms through two thousand and Fifteen and I was working at that point in Connecticut and they were on the area can I'm kind of stuck on Rogers email\nHow are you in the milk or are you looking\nHell yes I call myself a dairy made yes and I've never had the pleasure of owning the farm or haven't they respond to the lady and uh you know that challenges I've only had the joy I've only been able to enjoy the cows and go home at the end of the day\nWell and the lady who I had for milk cows are at the farm and you're going to be on a on the Sunday uh when I was a kid I work on the front of me I'd be currencies than uh but I and the jerseys and so raw milk for Seventeen years and the\nUh the lady who milk because for at least ten or twelve of those years was as you describe her name was Cindy choose as crazy as you could possibly imagine but she loved loved loved those cows and she took a very good care of them until she died a it was she was a character and I think\nThat's what it takes [laughter] plus people describe a lady who is a dairy made that as being very unique\nTo put it that way and Lucille sounded like she is Lucy what Bernard with us here on the American family farmer\nDoug seven here for purity products namely the krill omega fifty plus with co

her to get a second dessert for simple so sorry for them because you can't afford to run out\nAt you know I said I'm Glad to hear that and I think what you're touching on between you and I um we have and you can love a cow as much as any pet and go on a cat that\nYou might happen if they could get through the backdoor they'd follow me the ones we treat them like pets not everybody this is not practical I mean come on for the average guy who's got a dairy farm especially today in order to make three four five hundred cows and some of these awful big agro dairies have\nFive six seven eight thousand ten thousand because they don't know anything about the ... just a machine but for me and for us everybody had a name\nAnd they were all raised by women who lead them around and so they were like dogs they were not afraid of anything and yeah the ones that were my past the knew me well they would follow me if they could into the house\nAnd so that's but that's the difference and yeah the romanticized version of reality yeah but it's no reason to that kind of stuff can't exist in some way shape or form and I think that's kind of what you're pointing out here is that\nUm if I hadn't love can maybe as much as you loved ... is this book when it never happened um what happened with Bebe like Peter she got a disease I thought she was um ... death and I didn't own ...\nAnd I ran away I didn't want to watch her die hand when I got home I decided to model eyes her thumb areas the lifestyle the love of animals in the book not realizing\nHe had a false positive for um is it is and she is still alive today and really and I only found he live at Baldwin park found in Canterbury, Connecticut\nAnd share alive and well and and gets like ... she's the daughter of light and the matriarch she is out of the best bloodlines she is a set of the queen of the head and um\nIt was going to be such a lot to have her taking led us as he is called ... I'm not sure if\nYou've ever had any I yeah I have more than I run into a nut often but I have run into it yeah ... it's the end of the cow is at the end of the ... yeah\nIt is and it's it's very sad to watch him maybe um I Love the baby is the reason that this book and written at all um I cannot let her die in vain so to speak without um some you know concrete uh putting it into words what what it feels like to know these cows to work with them\nI'm like I said the ... and that the love and the joy that comes with it when it yeah and she's alive [laughter] yep\nIt's a fabulous thing it's a you know we all think about our dogs and maybe you got a pet a cat or some animal it's close to you or identify with that and then think about us or with our cows and then you have the theme for the book so\nThis is aimed at keeping the cause they want to talk to you and a few moments about some of the other things though even though we are dairy for the most part but there's a need for\nSome consumer education that I Would like to talk to you about and bring into the fold as we continue our conversation here on the American family farmer I'm Doug Stephan life changed tea\nIs on my mind and on the plate and on the docket for discussion at the moment a lot of people who work on the farm I eat well sometimes it's stuff that's grown on the farm\nAnd there is a a chance if you're eating

produce on your local farm and in the local markets\nDo the things you're producing this year especially meet the needs of your customers do you know what your customers want do they tell you by what

what you sold ... your needs to make money and met the needs of the people who are buying your products has met their needs I found that most people I Know when it comes because\nThings are becoming so rarified folks will pay almost anything for good fresh produce they don't like it they think it should be cheaper but they realize is a growing gap between the value of the food that he is not organic\nNot locally grown not natural and the stuff\nThat they can find in the regular grocery stores and so with the even the whole foods has kind of\nDisappointed I guess that's the best way that's the most positive way of putting it whole foods under the ownership of Amazon has changed a lot of quality of food is not as good quality helps not as good it's just not as good or can you find some things they're they're good the up and go to Trader Joe's it but mostly you go to your local market and go to the local farm\nAnd see what's there you can see what other people are buying\nA by especially this time of year where there isn't any more of potatoes or gamble locally here in my area potatoes have been wild really people love the locally grown potatoes and I can understand that as usual corn not going to go wrong with corn and tomatoes and\nThings like that the staples but whether people want things like carrots in beach or whether they want other things just um I guess I'm

to do this is animal welfare\nThere are perceptions about welfare on the farm and then there is reality I think in many instances\nAs a whole lot of different sometimes we get because the news media so exaggerated with his presentation on things\nWe see some farms that are mismanaged and they do take advantage of the animals but I think by far on the family farms that are dairy farms it's an important issue a and we are very conscious of it\nNot because somebody tells us to be but because that's the way we are\nBecause we're not just a health plan\nYou in Rome which is easy to December

S.\nMeans that you take an education and the training to work with\nSeniors at different ages and nobody wants to be called older except for like the four year old or wishes he was five years but so the designation kind of runs from baby boomers I needed a little bit earlier people who were just thinking about things like downsizing all the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old\nThere's a lot lower planning\nFamily conferencing things\nThings like downsizing all the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old there's a lot lower planning family conference saying things like that that go on then when the typical sale and it was a big need because sometimes people are\nTaking advantage of I see now according to its very definition the seniors real estate specialist designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate needs as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is not a smart idea or is that something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nMy opinion is is better off starting in early\nBecause that's been a real estate basically asked for different areas of possible gain\nThe first is appreciation on a property obviously rises in price over time as the area around it does as well second profit center is that the ten it increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage down three is cash flow\nRent better bigger than al slow\nAnd depreciation so in order to put all sort of those to work you really want to get started early\n... to be a first time a doctor in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps a look at things like we each real estate investment trust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchased itself\nWhen you and that makes a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have vacancies you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that if you believe that real estate boast appreciation generates cash flow which\nIt has historically done that's a great way not to be the only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate is is kind of a you know you're the person in a ... year spread out what's hundreds of other people buying larger block investment property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice be or if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that it can reap great benefits in the years ahead\nAbsolutely interesting fact the last forty years appreciation and least in order to regain area has averaged about three percent per year coincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area\nThree percent a year so if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage growth unemployment on track [noise]\nThere's no reason that real estate\nPricing at least closer in shouldn't keep pace with wage increases\nWe get tougher ... foods and find your next adventure new areas Lyle missile I'm not just exist in the living room\nArea in boot barn live free\nBecame the R D TV nine first of all their forecast for today partly cloudy and very windy\nI around forty four for tonight mostly clear with much lighter wind and a low twenty seven when today out of the northwest between twenty and thirty five ... and higher and tonight wet between five and that for tomorrow mostly sunny skies the highest fifty three\nI'm keeping ... joined the meteorologist Corey Thompson on news talk Fifteen forty KFC out the eastern Iowa Deborah jury is forty two degree\nOf voice of eastern Iowa\nNews talk to seem bleak K.

on\nOur we\nFound\nMy ... my\nStyle or\nIs it by William thin so great music\nTheater you and I always includes a musical in our season of plays and uh we chose this piece specifically because we knew it was becoming more popular and the fun nature of the show and really felt that there were a lot of roles and that would be really accessible for college students\nYou're doing it not at the regular un I venue but you're doing it at the uh a venue that a lot more people probably are familiar with Gallagher blue ... that's why we\nNormally produce theater you and I chose a stray would theater on the campus and this time I'm we're following up from two years ago when we did the musical into the woods or the Gallagher blue darn\nAnd found that the calendars worked out so that we were able to produce this show there as well um that's a really unique opportunity for our students because it kind of picks a different approach it takes planning a set that you can take apart and put it into a truck\nAnd on Saturday morning as a matter of fact the twentieth we'll\nPull up into the loading dock of the Gallagher with a truck full of scenery and crops and spend the next six days building that set rehearsing the show getting the music we've done and then on the twenty six we open the show\nHow many performances three performances so there's a the friday night Forman says seven PM and then the Saturday and Sunday performances or both two PM\nI asked a on how the Gallagher blue Dorn stage house are different from the stray or would theater\nThere's a lot more seats in the house so it's a much larger venue which creates a ... a interesting and challenging and\nAnd a lot more seats in the house so it's a much larger venue which creates a ... a interesting and challenging environment for the college students in terms of projection in terms of playing in a larger space so it's quite exciting to be in there\nAnd we had this idea early on as a matter of fact it was Anne's idea because the Gallagher is such a large space and this piece is kind of a little more intimate perhaps something that's a little more charming\nAnd so we wanted to also see if we could arrange the theater space in a way that allowed us to achieve some of that intimacy\nSo there is on stage seating for this show as well and as a matter of fact that's eating as free\nAnd so if people are interested in sitting on stage and there'll be closer to the action there are times when the show were audience members are involved in the action but sitting on stage doesn't necessarily targeting you as a ... going to be involved right but uh it's a unique way to see the show because you are right up there with the action\nIt'd be the audience for the spelling bee yeah yeah that's the that's the kind of the whole thing yeah it is a music goal so you need an orchestra or do you\nKnow we have a music director by the name of ... butler he's someone who's worked on our productions before and he's assembled a band that includes himself an for other people\nAnd um he's been rehearsing with them he's also been sitting in on the rehearsals that and has been having with the cast to ask acting as the rehearsal economist and he's very good at working with the students\nAnd is actually a guest director she comes from Texas and I'll let her talk a little bit about that but we were able to a cast the show in late August and then the cast spent two to three weeks with stuff just learning music\nAnd so by the time and got here hopefully the cast was pretty strongly late in with the music ... yet we work with a choreographer Mandy ... who teaches a lot of dance course work on the un I campus\nAnd she's a credible fun person to work with and really all his brings 'em a lot to the shows and demands a lot of\nThe students and Eric summed up the atmosphere there try and get create and we just got the words you may start\n\nI like the word sin and again there's a lot of shenanigans kind on during the show it's a lot of fun it's Ninety minutes let knowing their mission and so I've described the cast I said you're going to get on a train and it's going to pull out\nAnd not stop until the end of the show and so the audience can expect that as well it's a lot of running around and a lot of them high energy and good fun\nThat we do have an opportunity for guests spellers and these guess spellers are either pulled from the audience um we do have one kind of celebrity guest\nA feller Kroger is serving liberty guests speller and uh he will be there on the twenty six he's a old musical theater person themselves so he'll he'll have a lot of fun with that\nEric also has the information you need to know before you go\nDecker prices range from about Eighteen dollars up to a forty five or fifty

N. I. T. as an outsider that looks like it would be sort of a challenging situation because the schedule sort of fluctuates you're not certain what's coming up next after the first game in that event or how I Will you deal with that and and the unknowns that come with a\nYou know that's a great question because I've talked to several people who have played in the pre season W. I. T. who after the fact\nUm they're glad the play but they didn't like the the travel um the uncertainty of where you might be going or if you're paying at home that sort of thing\nSo really our approach first of all we're extremely thankful to our administrative to allow us an opportunity to host our very first game on November ninth against a very good Delaware team and then you just don't know uh one of the things that we've built this program on and we're really really good\nAt is is scouting report details and being able to lock into that on a one day ... well that's going to be tested really early because that's going to happen if we happen to win on friday\nNovember night we will play Saturday now whether that's home are away or who I don't know I bet it's a one day ... a lot of like what we have to do in the league so we're just going to get a little bit early and I and I'm excited for that we're going to get our feet wet we need to get our feet wet that's what's going to allow us to be paying good basketball come NBC time\nWill finally coach or other than the uncertainties about the the preseason W. N. I. T. and obviously that first game which you do know about\nIf there was one other game on home non conference schedule that you'd like to see a a good turnout for from panther fans because you think it would give the program a boost or it's a special opponent coming in whatever the circumstances what would it be and why all of them\nWe we need fans are kids work extremely hard\nUm and we play a good basketball and we would really like our fans to come out everyone who comes out they really talk about how hard our teams play how well they actually could they enjoy it we need more people to get involved but if there was one specifically\nUm I Would probably say Creighton or creating Big East um you you have to say the Big East is a power five um I played there they're really good friends of ours were very similar in terms of we both do the little things and scout each other extremely well and it's always a great game so if I had to say one that would probably\nWe're very similar in terms of we both do the little things and Scott each other extremely well and it's always a great game so if I had to say one it would probably be ... and\nObviously the special connection for your coach Warren thanks so much for being with us thanks to my appreciate your support and appreciate you having a un I panther women's basketball coach Tanya Warren with us for this edition of the home of the Panthers dot com pre game show on news talk Fifteen forty ...
