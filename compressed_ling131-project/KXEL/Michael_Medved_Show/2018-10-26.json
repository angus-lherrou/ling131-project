the background and we were you and I talked about this when it first you know most about a week ago mhm was first started that uh when we came back from vacation and\nWe saw the you know we saw social media\nAnd a lot of Republicans were saying well this they're doing this in order to affect election day and you and I came in and said wait a minute when you see how far away they are and how far they can walk in one day I'm not going to get here to weigh after election day so really this is going to hurt them this is not going to help the Democrats\nAre and I saw the story that the president you know plans on sending you know eight hundred troops down to the border\nWas in his big stories I thought it would be and I wonder that over the past week at the media has looked at this and said this isn't going to benefit us let's bring it up after the midterms right we believe this is actually helping Trump right and so since this isn't really going to say this is only gonna hurt as before the midterm but sort of buried the story a little bit or not\nArms fight we believe this is actually helping Trump right and so since this isn't really going to say this is only going to hurt us before the midterm let's sort of bury the story a little bit or not give it the emphasis that we were giving it\nBefore [noise] [noise] yeah I mean it's it ... it is the the um\nThe the the political tool at the moment right so if there is a greater political tool then you kind of jumped to that\nAnd we'll see where the story goes with the you know suspicious devices or whatever we're calling them now I'm over I suspect that if if they know\nWhere these things are being mailed from there it will only be a matter of time if if if not hours before they find out or at least know who the person might be\nUm ... and and even apprehend them someone had said on Thursday morning I was watching some of the coverage and a one law enforcement I'm\nA ... not not an unofficial or investigator in the case but an expert commenting said it's quite possible we could see somebody arrested are apprehended as early as today and that that's just just based on how quickly it works and how much physical evidence there is in this case\nYou get that and and we find out what the motivation is I guess of the person possibly I'm assuming that they are taken alive\nAnd it becomes again I'm that\nChanges this narrative and and do you go back a few of the media or you're a an operative on the left\nTo go back to the caravan um the caravan thing it kind of paused because of so many I guess I'm concerns along the way now you had um you know the the department of homeland security saying look you know people will be apprehended that's going to be the case\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times when he was true mhm\nAnd when you look at the things that we believe they work\nMhm that's why we promote that that's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down to the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way ...\nThere are some not all but there are some of the right they want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height\nYou know you and I ... and that's why we talked about dictator remember when uh we we sit here Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right\nWhile his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes what does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm\nWhich wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hay and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America a of a\nMess of messages thank you very much [laughter] to friday or hate America message ... as he said come on\nIf you look at Obama certainly not religious why don't you think\nThat if somebody like Obama worships anybody else out there do you really really think that you really think he's devoting that there is I got up there that tells him what to do ... please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence matters across the board and we've been pushed back because we've done that\nUh one of the biggest push facts we had was when we made fun of jade helm Fifteen remembering ... probably the number of people that called us and were furious at us\nBecause we were a mock and it was ridiculous\nYou know the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it's these secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels and\nWool Mart and everything else and people are jumping aboard this crap but it's pure crap and you buy into it\nSeparate yourself from those idiots over their\nDeal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the truth not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world because everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter] well I mean we're we're just going to start thinking what would I I'll never forget the I'll never forget that moment on a jade helm ...\nFifteen when you know it was the\nWe were getting barrage of phone calls you guys just don't understand you don't understand where we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh we know something that you don't know there are more I feel special because somebody else has told me in and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nYou don't know there are more I feel special because somebody else has told me and and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done from the local chamber of commerce at one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county frightened by [laughter]\nThe money that was going to be spent on the nose was going to be ... be spent that's how secreted was life that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone yeah [laughter] you know we've we've dealt with it and we we dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to we\nActually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes\nSo for us it's a constant fight and you know what the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to run for re portions of Popular Mechanics number Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics ... and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for these things these theories about mechanics in physics are being put out there that's what we do like to see whether they're actually possible or not\nUh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um we dealt with it the night of the Saturday off brothers so man so we go on it we had been getting a information coming in about what\nWas going on and we're in Watertown I'm about thirty minutes before we went on so that'll Evan thirty central that night\nAnd we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of both of those reports 'cause there there was breaking news and we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails this is Boston bombing the other bothering bombing suspects and when they essentially went through water\nTown and and uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the the the ...\nAbout I don't know half way through the show when we looked at our email it was coming in and it was about well if it and they gave us Pacific name these are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there why are you saying this asking nuts\nAnd they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names quite\nAnd look we're not going to be I don't have\nAny a desire to go out and be first I only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate if we're because we often report on breaking news we don't I Do I Do not\nWant to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross at ABC\nI don't\nBecause here's what's different about specific names if we if the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we recovered and we've covered some big stories over the years\nThe details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or it was in this town not this town when it is a specific name\nIf those names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross or anyone else that might be reporting something then\nYou start saying that because of Brian Ross so they'd be see after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well how do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and he got burned and and he got burned big time\nI Believe the goal than it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as\nFor the last half of our show because we weren't putting the name out effect you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who they were chasing them\nAnd that always the sunny I mean we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify from many legit source that we believe that we have confidence in that it is uh that that is true and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right\nAnd so again we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication you're hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nAnd so when I look at this week that's what we've been focusing on\nIs for the Republicans on the conservatives just focus on the truth but so you can you can passionately attack the other side\nBut don't play their game ... I've said before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view they need it they ... out of desperation that they do it\nI don't feel desperate and whether whether\nWhether the side that I favor more wins an election or loses an election right I have never felt the need to use inflammatory rhetoric because I feel I have lost the substance of my argument\nTwo thousand two thousand eight denied of election night uh you know are they all the\nPower goes to the Democrats and we've got calls why aren't you guys angry ... look it didn't go my way I'm disappointed but I had my thing and that\nWell we had been blunt\nUh I've a friend of mine yesterday posted well you know the whole country's going much more conservative right now\nAnd I said look on social issues they are on fiscal issues or not and I explained it to him the debt mhm the country's not going the way that I Want when it comes to debt Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations right they've completely\nJust said let's not even pay attention to it right that doesn't matter anymore what we've put on future generations doesn't matter anymore we don't care we think that's wrong for the Republican Party right we think that's immoral of the Republican Party to not be wearing that as a badge of honor every single day\nWe understand that because they are following what the people are doing that yeah the rank and file other and that's why we brought up that remember that the swamp\nJust three years ago the swamp was about Republicans who wouldn't be fiscally responsible mhm that's gone yeah that's all that that swamp doesn't even exist anymore of fiscal responsibility in the Republican Party that drove\nTrump ism I'm looking at our sleepy right now the current makeup of the house it's a map of the United states read versus blue and\nTrump ism I'm looking at our sleepy right now the current makeup of the house it's a map", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "26"}
