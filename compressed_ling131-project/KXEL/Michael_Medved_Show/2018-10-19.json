win\nCertainly any big off since I I have friends who are libertarians obviously\nI say obviously because on my side but I Do have people Democrats were my friends and so on but the two parties it it's one of all in this country and\nThey get elected to office you got to be Republican or Democrat almost always in some small offices even a green green party lady who won in Los Angeles actually a friend of mine\nWas small office community college board but she wanted and I'm On the Green Party member so can be done but the big offices\nWith all the structure and the the requirements to get on the ballot or certainly for president a working your way down and it's too difficult then none of people\nAre going to support cheer for a third party to make it so that you know I'm Sorry go ahead\nNo that that's a nice steak or mark or something I'm very interesting but you know what\nBut what it does it it can troll some people it controls the I mean it it is what it is and and you know when I hear you say you know people hate the conservatives are they have this\nYou know hey is a very powerful word the very power or um\nYou know I Do like some of the people in the other party I mean I'm a I'm a conservative no matter what I Love what Trump do it um you know I I Can't believe that it's not that Kennedy by now uh you know and and the mob in it however\nYou know I hate saying it it it\nIt's over taken a\nDay and and you know I grew up in the eighties we didn't have this kind of hay and uh you know it it it's really hard to swallow watching my you know kids grow up in that hate environment and I I don't like that word\nMhm [noise] well I I understand that you know I appreciate your call I understand that you don't like no I'm Glad you didn't say you hate that word\nBut I understand that the ... but that's what is going on and that's why I said we ... it looks like we have this kind of civil war notice I didn't say that I said that the I think Democrats Mr misinformed and they think we're evil so that's that's a big difference right there let's go to a\nThat is Joe and ... junior Joe you're on with mark\nMartin Morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic I uh I'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I wanted to also say you know on Facebook [noise] I've I've shut down based just because even if I had\nIt with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on their shirt I mean just for no reason you know it was almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know [noise] um [noise]\nI mean it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the name Trump sometimes you know\nA but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there [noise] um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a\n... we have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something and then um one day or the host said to me you know mark a her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said I'm a while I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that\nThe eventually hope people come around before ... happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life has her short but when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whenever that because of politics they disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in their relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nHeard discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nBy markets great to talk to you I'm I'm a Republican and conservative my whole life then I went into the military right after high school\nAnd I'm getting most of the people that I met in the military where which are because they felt like the Republicans are the only one that whatever support\nRaise for you know the military pay as I kind of you know just said okay well that's there for me than I Am for them um then as time went on um\nWhen I'm the first are you\nAll go walk him about um I just remember you know listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this ...\nAt the time I was driving a lot and in spending a lot of time the car and I'm just want it to listen and you know he's found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh are you going for them and it's like people started coming to me and pointed out of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them\nAnd um and when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from me friends and relatives just stopping and my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I used for somebody who's just you know terrible\nAnd I'm just like you know stand mad at Republicans for Twenty years\nFor letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him\nAnd he still conservative said it didn't take our country better and you know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just thinking about the greatest economy you know we in the country's ever seen you know we have it I\nMean do you see jobs trick truck drivers should at least five thousand\nDollar bonuses for someone to start that job you know I mean\nCan you actually are that are just they don't have enough people to do them and and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money so it's like you know if you get the right to greet you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get to drive a truck working construction and\nYou know everyone seems to be still upset anything close to stand back and look at what's going on but\nYou know I I had a friend you tell me right to my face I get so mad at you and I when I read the thing\nThat I just want to shoot you and the head and she made the hand signal legumes owning a gun at my cat and I I ... so hurt by that and yeah I I haven't talked to that one of the you know nine months ago and\nIt just seems like a lot of my friends are just like we can't do you find that demand that they cause she like Donald Trump and I just don't want to be around here anymore and it\nAnd it's hurtful and um\nYeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of all of this I'm a transgender woman on the white hated me for a trans left hated me because I like Donald Trump and you know my ... a lot of people my family is like me because\nI transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a chance to people that look like how can you be Republican nephew chance she hates us and I'm just like really doesn't you know and so it's like I owe all these angles for coming at me\nTelling any set I'm wrong for being who I Am and I don't think that anything worse than life people telling you they can't accept you for who you are and and it's it's just horrible [noise]\nWell I feel your pain that I can use the bill Clinton line but I can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you I Can't imagine what you're going through a\n... it's tough enough or the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us let alone or when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nAnd she pretty discouraging I think you need to do is find new friends you know people who are least will share your Republican views\nOr to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and homophones as a whole is kind of stuff when we're not to just have to find the right\nPeople and and maybe he does that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations but that may ...\nYou know a ... to work for a ...
