going to be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much um when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty eighth\nOr when the president is trying to get Iran\nA you know the sanctions on Iran which means the world Laurel market is going to you know increase the cost of oil even though we are producing a more when steel aluminum or up when we uh we had been told the fourth quarter could be hit because of the two hundred billion dollars in tariffs at ten percent that went in\nSeptember ... September twenty eight eventually the market's going to react to that and you can't raise raising the cost of doing business is never a positive for the economy right but everything that we talked about and everything that every financial magazine has talked about\nAbout why the stock market has been hit has to do to what government action mhm regulation tech companies fright or tariffs the the the the fed our our national debt and the bond interest rates going up all of its related to what\nGovernment intervention in some way eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Gigi ... associates incorporated on customer service does your motor carrier provides uniforms for you to wear on the job does your company require drivers to adhere to a dress code\nIf the answer to both questions is no than it might be a good idea to Institute a self imposed dress code of parents can say plenty about a person the driver who shows up at a delivery dressed in a professional manner gives the customer a better impression of the company and the individuals they're working with\nIf you're in the middle of a long run be sure to pack enough clean clothes for the journey driving can be grueling and demanding as the old saying goes close make demands and fresh clothing can help you feel more comfortable while on the road and when taking breaks for a meal this\nTemple is brought to you by Jean J. killer and associates incorporated visit us on Jay Jay Keller dot com\nThis has been the merit George driver report brought to you by pilot flying J shell world satellite and marriage or after market run with the bowl [noise]\nWas uh he wrote a review with every ...\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you buy a free vine or trucks\nProfessional truck driver [noise] now we also want from the ... center ... you can retain your phone ... foreign reserves are you saying that's right also one members in reserve their parking space through the reserve system right from the front smart mobile left\nOnline through the reserve a website\nFive popular west and you can see your point for [noise]\nYou know many drivers who at a time and money looking down officers or reserve it handled now with police marketing in health [noise]\nReserving arsenal pieces [noise] only seeing an ad for stopping centers and ultra one remember cultural money's involving flush for more news majors and benefits rolling out later this year because here it's not the\nOnly one\nWas such\nA great products deserves a great look sounds liver caters introducing their new logo on their new labels houses more than just their diesel free dance I jump they have a full family a brace\nIt sounds liver caters introducing their new logo on their new labels houses more than just their diesel treat anti jail they have a full family a breed products from house meaner power cleaner a top of the line diesel injector glitter and Bloomberg papers to house multi purpose liberator\nAnd penetrating oil an alcohol free product with over one thousand or more uses so much for the new logo and all of the great house products on the market\nHow's lubricate or a family company with a family of products that you can truck\nDrivers this is Gary Myrna launched the volume on and now lonesome road volume two is just out and we would love to send your copy give us a call was six one eight three three twenty on oh seven lower on our website owns a road dot org mentioned that you heard this ad\nOn red eye radio and we'll send you a copy of bought into for only ten bucks and if you didn't get along well maybe a special deal if you order by one and two years ago [noise]\nMurphy McGrath from a ... dodge ram pickup truck tires were new twenty Nineteen rams are twelve thousand optimist R.

Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons I said a including perhaps a ... a political agenda\nWith respect to that but the thing about this about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo it's fair Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do\nIs make a law that everything must be produced\nHere because then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies that would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be sued and retail doors shutting\nLeft and right and you know the opposite for job would go in a massive recession\nIf we had a policy that we produce everything in this country prices of goods and services would skyrocket\nThrough the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology\nA a again because it makes them more profitable for American producer yes and and we're ... we're going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most under reported stories of the entire year ...\nIs that the United states\nIs now on an happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason ... supporting a or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] if not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to get right\nSo the but but you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something about us policy put in place that doesn't need to be there look\nNow and go in and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a Jew things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCandle had already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was lauded as the great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory in that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed a was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that is used as a victory rally remember two of the president's major goals his goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and\nUh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the ... were the because at the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite\nOf the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry are now\nYou you talk about you know the farmers I mean you\nIf you if you say it's a very populist viewpoint right we need to help the farmer but when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set of before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world that food goes all over the world um you know and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the ... because forget about the political pawns president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to ah I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling while I Am ... and ...\nOf of getting things die as you said it was like it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday showing ...\nAnd that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nWell wait he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get the ... because she Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know and again him\nIn order to get the ... to go ... done\nHe's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that well as I said you know and again and we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the\nYou know it and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in a Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually but the president did a lot of what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was at worst the loss of business with the terrorists but the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted in automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight or and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal said must and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really is and go into effect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states sell our vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his caps on what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other tariffs hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the United states was only selling six thousand to begin with", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "12"}
