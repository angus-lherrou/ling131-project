I didn't ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to know and even\nThough that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right I mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually\nIs the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base right they don't care right we don't uh well because Obama is yesterday's news well listen\nI mean I'm a lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was a hero with them over the point is is not to Lanny Davis is is a block Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left am I the way that the euro is going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now but\nTomorrow you're going to be the presser there's the person standing next to you will have a new reason to weigh victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's an here's\nBut my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my God that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a beta or care in the state of Texas so I look at [noise] I'm ... I'm going to use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster\nRight\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there any like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to like to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his uh inauguration till the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay also eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not ... as a president like Kim cause you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... also predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or Pelosi's getting old and you know they're just Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party he's nothing anymore\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty six team won five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest\nProtest march and was peaceful up until that point of course\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook so I'm watching\nThe thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was began as twenty sixteen months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen\nWaters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nCracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it would have had started happening before that for me it was\nTelling because you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American\nWhat does Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party\nParty doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no rational right and it it it always will be that's why the party has no ...\nThat's what you get with identity politics yeah because there is no there are still there and I edited there is there is no general issue or goal ... goal\nThat they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goals this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh yes if the activists are are\nAre going in multiple directions ... than the party has led by them they're going to try and it was every direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now you're nights the Democrats right eight six six Ninety road I\nWas really much of a better record on the radio [noise]\nListen to read I radio show wherever you are with our free app for your iPhone or Android more info at red eye radio show dot com and use the keyword mobile", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "05"}
