for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm uh\nAnd you had and and and even before that but ah before the election\nOr you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and or I Know in ... but that wasn't unification there were people there was an intensity there\nThat existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together early on McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right or the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that is when they blew the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that when I read that was on a specific\nTopic yeah I the ... same thing heart bright that's powered how sure I Lived yeah sure sure this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about ... this isn't really about Trump\nAnd and reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal or interesting that they write those the same day that you know the ... the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going wild because the never conservatives the cabinet fight it\nThey write those the same day that you know the ... the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while those the never conservatives the cabinet fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now ah and as soon as you look at you know talks about the cabinet is a\nPart of you know ... isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nBut I say he's he's separate from that can believe that we talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nAnd in supportive of up cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it\nWell except maybe for Bill Kristol [laughter] you're right [laughter] that was the one old out except for except for Bill Christ and I haven't seen anything from George and it's like ... you know they're not part of the ... he he's not some of the rights and he's not some Steve Bannon insurgent and\nThe judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization\nFrom\n... from ... I think you know the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah\nAnd don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nUh we got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case he'll Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is but it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say of culture war because it's a war on\nIt it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were we were never on that never I'm never going to vote for him we voted for him\nAnd hug you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us in rallies going ra ra ra whenever my candidate does we will tell you is the best ... well you know who has the best idea on one particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults so see that what do we know many things that I think I Would only unfair\nAs I read Rick Perry in front of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well uh you know I guess she wasn't your first choice if they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me\n[laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these number Trump or is going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the left\nYou know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are number Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really weak at wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is an almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democratic side that all want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\nCat back they listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party\nOr a or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to this point of the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm it's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh ... who was at a I'm trying to think of the the the the person oh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary right yeah\nUh I I saw this week because I I I saw that the Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media and a lotta people furious saying excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and those that are Jonathan as a ... there at\nThese on Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that when\nIt came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right by the way that was after the the the house report that house GOP report the eight hundred page report\nOn ...\nYeah so I I think that's you know what's happening so again or you look at that and you say wow I ... for Republicans then I say this Washington Examiner or which is a for anybody to

the FBI has done and the actual report aired you've been doing some research or during the break on that\nYeah so there was back in two thousand I'm by the way the Democrats control the Senate and the

Carter right need to I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific the allegation will get into the the the details but here it is this the first line congressional investigators have confirmed but at the top FBI official met\nBut but really I mean the approach would likely be it because I could see a a rural being enforced is breaking the rules and and it is punishable\nI don't know what that punishment is um but certainly you don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate\nThere's a lot of close races and there's no one\nYou know talking about a blue wave and the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place uh in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward [noise]\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that\nBut you probably could see them saying look and it it's going to be that it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday well there are dozens of people thousands of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that have ah have information or potentially they could be witnesses that is one of the words they use potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you're probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold the elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough the the we need of a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to forward or Kavanaugh\nThere's new allegations that are coming out here are that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the whole forever but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff first and not on this banana ships and who will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell\nOut of a of a DC uh yesterday about the James Baker [laughter] ah apparently telling\nThe house or the house uh uh I don't know which panel it was but uh in in touch closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official\nA at that time which without question shows that politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely the wrong thing to do right\nNow you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked\nAbout where this were ... might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come\nTrue and it is all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that uh a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a Giuliani pointed out you know there's not there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that or Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling that Democrats would do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it and they know the Republicans Rome release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep a ...\nRural and the fact that hey we can't be ... every background check we do have our bridges of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nAnd the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I can finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in a ...
