a jumble had a show dog ... to follow me on Twitter after jumbo talks\nTo be talking to lie about parenting and a couple of terms that had been used over the years a woman or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been raised by our guest Dr John Huber clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health a doctor's uber thank you for being with us today\nWell thank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll right the first one is a helicopter moms or or helicopter parents of I guess most of us understand that it is a term of ... representing parents who Albert over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults would be a reasonable definition or would you uh ...\nAnd that's a pretty good\nAnd in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you meant that\nMuch but that's a pretty good definition and ah I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserve things in life\nBecause their parents did those kinds of things [noise]\nAll right uh ... that's something else that it it seems to me that\nLet the generation that has provided us with a helicopter parents\nOr their parents as as a group probably we're not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean ... it's hard for me to to think that uh\nBefore this generation of the ... parents that we had a a generation before that of parents that are essentially provided the role model for these people uh it it seems to me that these people sort of sprung up uh\nUh on their own ended the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back\nA that many generations as it\nDoesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who've always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation is a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents\nA lot more parents literally mowed down any obstacles any threats of confrontation any chance of failure for their kids which\nYou know a rational adult understands failure for children is learning opportunity and teach you how to deal with loss and how to how to recover from that you can build on your experiences\nAnd these kids are\nGetting much less of that than the helicopter kid from the helicopter law\nSo it's getting worse it's Ellicott their parents on steroids\n... exactly exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others that tonight da da da da da da da da da di ...\nYou're in great myself I just got to say the helicopter and more and more parents down by the kind of parents who were glad they have their children grow up and force you know bubbles Tibet responsible\nFor that now you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much of a dichotomy there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I see a doctor uber I think the da da da da da da da da da\nDa de ... is a a an adult who is dependent on the world for things and not just the premise that completely entitled they deserve this and you know I was ... day one\nI don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to get anywhere in this world\nYeah uh what what would what certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts on because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo here right now uh you know I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the the young people I Know by by that by my definition I'm Talking about\nA parent's today's parents who are generally of course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not of a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not a this category uh I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and just that includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself up dusting yourself off in the whole learning experience is there any kind of a\nOf a originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know but I have ever actually match a helicopter parents much less a lot more parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily region alley I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six into two thousand\nAnd one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last four\nYears I Will get calls from parents go what do you mean my travel got us thirty on their cats so I go why can't even concern about your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go where you're actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't just you know\nYou used to me when I got a thirty a hundred other tests I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nAt ... at at the university level not even at the high school level\nAnd he used to me when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level management at the high school level\n[noise] wow uh I had\nOne flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me [laughter] about their child's grade [laughter]\nWell good heavens above that that does almost Dale a literal helicopter or this case an airline and I guess a remarkable hour ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo hadn't show with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\n... a doctor and ask questions are okay I've got a I've got a one year old grandson on kind of worried about situational about are all on me I don't even know if she'd be considered as long more ... and something else going on I mean\nShe obsessed with taking pictures are loving their desk\nAs he stands up you know it's like he held a baby that's ever done it and she won't even let them sit like what myself grabbing laughing I physically go there and grab because\nBoys on top of them they you know and he can't be around leather grand kids you know they're playing and they get so there are there some germs you know it's like ... and I'm almost worried about I mean\nMaybe you should be more than almost worried [laughter] humor to Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nI Am I have but I I I'm assuming this is our first child\nHow 'bout that Gray's ...\nOkay and you know at first child you know they they are at the store and they are in the living room they spent their pacifier out and you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes before he can put it in\nA ... by by the time she has her third kid she become dusted off it doesn't matter she didn't know about God or in their mouth you know so there are even more dads that'll change how I heard if she drops\nTo pass by she goes by and they will do in la\nOh well All right now the ... and why is it yeah going when my daughter\nYeah remind her that you know you you raise a child and grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah I have a\nCommon enemy [laughter] okay a little cynicism there for the program I Love it Tom in Port Angeles Washington he'd been job\nHello gentleman that the uh one of the things that generates show adopt the mob just the amount of legislation that's out there that give the seat that the CDC that child at the Olympic people\nAnd uh and and the communities\nCan get word of something and your your child got injured or you know did you leave go to play in the yard and this happened or that try to you at the car seat issue you know do you have the right one for your head at at that age part that if there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that\nYou would never dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my church is right\nAnd and my parents never would've dreamed you know that somebody would have a hand here at the state or local level [noise] ah so that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering a used right on the trucks writers of a fifty three Chevrolet pick 'em up truck and hang out with a\nMan of the truck yeah we can't ride in the bed in the truck now yeah exactly no I Know\nAnd and and and and it does nova things that I could think of you guys go I get that next caller good\nWell that's how you are your thoughts are Tom what extent it has a government if not impose this on us at least encouraged this\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help and right and and\nWhat happened is you get you get a local minority of people and they go out there and the rain this think and they stand up in front of\nSchool boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things in post now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree with\nThat but\nYou know uh I've been involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of people\nFollowing a pediatrician the word to the letter a on a first child or something and the pediatrician assume that oh you know they're an adult bell bell no they can't hungry you don't wait three hours to feed on even though I said you know do you every three hours\nAnd all of a sudden you get a child protective services involved in it because you know the kids take being taken up the hospital because they have crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not feeding the kids and the mother's like no I'm the I'm just like the doctor told me every three hours [laughter]\nAnd it's crazy [laughter] it's scary for new parents especially young ones\nAnd uh they\nThey follow those rules and then what happens will care they hit the public school system and they learn\nHey as your parents do this child abuse so clear parents that a child abuse\nAnd they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook cuts says ... ... really you can do parenting and what you can\nWell a suffice it to say we somehow it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and other people in the audience managed to get her a\nCourtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess the the the old methods at least a do not to cause a tremendous tremendous a fatality rate among our young people that might be some lessons there to be to be learned from that we'll talk some more about this tonight this tendency\nIn the direction of not just helicopter parents bunch [laughter]\nLawnmower parents I mean at some point or this has to be arrested has to be stopped one eight six six five oh jumbo back in a moment [noise]\nThe official home of a un I Panthers is do we\nGet to the Waterloo Cedar

organized will up will become politically active will elect people to whom we agree\nI think he was they might have been younger students in school but the thing about it is I think I told him I ... a lot of cases where the problem with these kids they don't know how to problem solve number two they don't know anything about elections you know somebody said she had the process\nAnd they used to teach civics them and so on anymore I I I had to do that's also part of the problem\nYeah but but what you just said is very telling limited they don't know how to problem solve come off right now is the point of raising a kid if you do to the end of the day produced someone who can problem solve I mean\nRight All right that's true why have them\nI mean no seriously why have a kid I you can't just be doing it out of cruelty less producer a human being who will ... failed miserably who will drop it in life and and do all we can to to handicap nobody says that there is what they're doing at the\nGuy the guy said it made it sound like the kids have no future now that well Republicans are running the country or ...\nAgain point I mean it's pretty cheap you want to have that view that you're perfect right as an American so do something about uh do suck your bomb right to organize it I mean I I may I Will be you and I hope that I don't step on your pressures little self esteem\nBut that's the only political debates all about do you feel that way they do something about an all out\nI went into this whole still ISIS problem is that the school she took control your kids and yeah they came the parents in many cases you you're not saying anything are not going any PTA meetings the old way they used to and place you know\nWell and if they do go to complain about the labor and what I'm about their kids on what our guest to comment one windows that say which I think it's a lot to Dr Huber\n[noise] she she has had a lot and there's a lot of the litter the two that the schools\nYou know they they used to be locally controlled and now they're they're nationally controlled and just like what what they need in in their state in in California or Washington state\nIs different than what they need in Florida and Texas and Georgia and New York straight you know we need to I think my at history of the school psychologist tells me we need to go back and let the states starts setting\nOr the standards of what their kids need to learn their at 'cause our federal government air dropped out of the picture as far as you know they don't even requires but recommends spelling or national education agency says we don't have to worry about spelling anymore 'cause everything has spell check drama\nAnd you know no more curse of language that you don't have to learn to write and curses well she can't write encouraged to camp reading her so so\nHow are we supposed to go back and actually individually read the magnet Carter or the constitution or the bill of rights

decided to wait um but they don't see\nThat having\nKids is difficult and harder in stressful and takes crying and energy you know and it's easier with money but you don't necessarily have to have money to raise your kids [noise] so\nIt would be helpful if you have young moms who weren't ready could be trotted back into schools to tell the story you may remember me I was four years older than

majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday\nThings will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact\nOf the capital and that entire\nThing and really look at the our CPA for example in Montana isn't a tossup state right with test or you know up uh the last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was tester up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up said why is that definitely on the on the Senate race yeah ... right and and so but ... my point is though yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe hour cp average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are\nA lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and [noise] I guess historically kenner shift happened uh with\n... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nBy the recent polls that were done in that race ah the the uh you know test her up by by four and the gravitas a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck or they call like a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up\nThat's my point my point is it's our cp has it as definitely blue\n... him\nOn my map but still showing great it's just one gray\n[laughter] just sit there and get it when it just wiped grey eye thanks to the staff at our sleepy for ... that it was it that way of what happened and just when it just when gray yeah All right I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great ... tiny brain ask myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look at the ... when you're paws on my way and all of a sudden the updates and heads gray in front of mania\nBecause ... Arizona was in grade before\nOr Arizona was like blue was flashes or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to have sat next because it makes Sally and\nAll of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because Mick Sally there's been a huge swing they're okay and recent polls are going from All right I'm an al Marri Sienna ... Atlanta when and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent poster\nBut it is a it's it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the polls are in fact I'm ...\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's\nUm and it is a it's a different uh the ... are in fact I'm rally\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the R. C. P. Senate map and the one next what is the Senate note toss up\nOkay they don't include any taught some Senate ... what I was okay but that's what I was ... I Know that is either but if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis All right but it makes sense now because I was like well how can you call\n... Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way that the wrong map\nOr the the New York times CNN poll the sly poll that continues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee\nBlackburn now are on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on bread ascendant and his volunteers right furious the fact that he said he would have been ... cabin all\n... well something's happening there yeah I mean you see bad us and then the CNN\nPoll going back to a a between nine eleven and nine Fifteen of likely voters and brought us in what's up five but always the polls the recent polls are from last week and this week show Blackburn leading but the New York times poll\nA ten eight to ten eleven uh the New York times Seattle for ... point lead\nFor the Republican Marsha Blackburn\nNot smash up ... in a month that is a Nineteen points when yeah that's huge is\nHuge are your calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety what I [noise]\nThese ...

... second time caller thanks a lot about the capital a spectacle than calling at ... at all costs relations spectacle\nRegarding the moderate Republicans the heads of the standard um go along to get along\nThey had woken up and I'm Wondering if this is er an apt analogy I don't know how do they apply for it but uh in the same way that the u._s. was not aware\nThat they were under attack by a\nIslamic his stream as a terrorist until nine eleven you know they had the ... bombing they had the uh the Trade Center in Ninety three they weren't really woke up an aware until nine eleven happened and the same way I don't think that a lot of Republicans were aware that there that that\nExtreme left wing extremism is at war with conservatism until last week\nA novel in this sort of reality not only conservatism just anybody who is opposite than even a a a poll politically a death not necessarily any logically but no I don't think it's an planetary what you said because remember in the nine eleven commission\nWhich was put together a bipartisan they said the problem with the United states was they were at war with us and we weren't at war with them right uh and that was added like an antibody so that came from the nine eleven commission so there's nothing inflammatory about that and\nI think your analogy I I think if you look at that I think also it's I think it's correct that the Republicans many of them and the center now are clearly no I mean when you have to think about this when you have\nA Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins being the ones who were the ... that really carried if it but not so much with Collins but certainly Lindsey Graham carrying the conservative torch\nThat's when you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lynch\n... that's when you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to campaign anywhere and everywhere I can a purple states and and everywhere else\nI think you have to include Susan Collins in in that well I knew she wouldn't dare that they are the two that will be remembered though Scott British ... in terms of their mark\nOn this event no doubt her speech for the most part no doubt um she didn't carry she didn't carry the way I guess Lindsey Graham riot but yeah I Would uh she would do that I wouldn't have seen comic I could've seen\nIf you were to ask me maybe weeks out and told me the situation comic\nI could've still seen as a Collins going well no I'm going to vote no and then a a high camp voting yes right mhm so I mean that that would have been or somebody if you would have told me that's what's going to happen I was like oh okay I see it\nI don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it'd be impossible for although ... closest and other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more of the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more but costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy and in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating\nA a ... basically\nThe ... the ability or more and more to control pricing to keep

GPS doesn't want to call for the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know uh the\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were were into communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on those devices if they're still preserved and anyway\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm you have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand than what I Would wonder is a\nBlend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word ... that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look I've ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a mother investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with the actual Russia collusion with the Trump campaign so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know what I don't know where there was any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money for ... thrown opposition research firm that just on the level is is ... that's what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell and then finding the time it gets interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll do under oath I'll ... there are plenty of people that don't wander oh mhm so what is the crime that he is more than that what is the charge\nThat blends Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr if there's someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis from yes\nThose are the questions that would they get those are questions on the investigator would have running through their ... yes that's all we're not indicting anybody yet [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "12"}
