[laughter] I've never been more than my life I voted for so tomorrow and K. and our never done this to them\nOr you have it you're not something that the uh though\nI won't see the left forgets about the the left doesn't care about\nYou know uh you don't get any points out that that by the way Senator Lindsey Graham ah on Sunday Morning but you don't get any points from the west not that Lindsey Graham was trying to get on the Web by supporting sort of my work and Kagan\nUh but you see that situation and they what they forget is the process\nAnd what they forget is how many people on Capitol Hill\nOr at least bid on Capitol Hill respected process at one time\nOkay just a little nit picking mhm I Know was it was a good battle to win stop the war but it was a good battle the wet right\nAh I just hope for the next Supreme Court justice and I just hope they started laying the base now that the Republican Party stopped calling the judges conservative judges mhm you\nAnd I've gone through this before we talk about how we even have got caught saying it just because you know it it's a ... but they're not conservative judges there is a complete and total difference between what conservatives wanting the Supreme Court justice and what liberals want\nMhm uh we want to Supreme Court justice that has an originalist or a ... you know and or construction is somebody will look at the text of the of of the constitution whatever it is and say it says this and I'm not going to read into it\nIrrespective of whether it hurts my day to day politics\nA Supreme Court justice putting them into office was not about my day to day politics it's about upholding the constitution of the United states it is about the legislate short making laws and not an unelected the judge\nTo the left is about an unelected judge\nMaking law making legislation mhm we go back to\nThey're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nAs\nTheir opinions don't and their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see\nThe left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw over the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party\nIn Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll slander and the fame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was New Bern in my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent ... for years and used to vote for Democrats he's trying to tell me how I can never vote for democratic get ever ever when I'm being told what white males think this is always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\n\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the left we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now ... [laughter] ... a reporter who said that you know basically it's time to rid of the Senate\nSo have you ever to the electoral college here to the Senate the pits our entire narrative that they actually hate the constitution of the United states in ... actually don't like the United states because they want to change all the basic tenants of the constitution so that we will get to that House Democrats talk impeachment\nA Senator Graham says you want to pick a SCOTUS judge win the presidency hey let's get back to Russian collusion well\nIt's about time there's a couple of Russian collusion story so out there but but not the Republicans are Trump colluding with the Russians by the way no ah wow left is really going back let's bring back Colin Powell for perspective see that [noise] well yeah\nWell why don't we first see how many of the protesters there at SCOTUS on the steps can identify Colin Powell through a picture or tells you buy given his name if they're given his name\nWho he is or what he was the fact that guy that was kneeling for the national anthem to write a plus a tropical storm Michael heading to the panhandle of Florida well the latest updates on that plus your calls and comments if you'd like to get in lines open now eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWhat book he wrote a review a record ...

eight six\nSix Ninety or red eye Eric I'm sure you agree with me on this we haven't even had the discussion on this but I think one of the things that the Republicans learned who might have forgotten about it is\nA the anger isn't just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump\nFrom the left the anger has always been there the rage has always been there well excuse me it's been there for the last couple of decades and I found that I Would say but it has been the last couple of decades it was there a Bush like I said we forget we have short memories Bill Maher was one who said\nWell yeah you know we we said Bush was Hitler we said Rami was Hitler but they really weren't but this guy really is\nNo as we found out it doesn't matter who you are if\nYou are on the other side they will come after us they will defame you their rage will be amplified him will continue to be amplified to the point where you're like I really can't believe\nWhen you when you look at it when you saw some of these protesters you say I really can't believe that you know these these people have\nA critical thinking bought that actually goes through their head\nWell keep in mind I mean you know for a at least five days or so Jeff Flake was a hero remember when Coons called him a hero he was a hero in all this when he delayed the\nProcess a that was until a vote\nYour hero until about it and it doesn't matter who you are even if you're on the left they don't you're not useful to them anymore Beto O'Rourke does not need to Brock Obama campaign ... so it doesn't matter who you are you're not immune for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nAs cleanup continues in the south after one of the most devastating storm systems to ever hit the U.S\nWe are looking at again today for clear skies in the region the Florida Panhandle the big band in fact the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all the way over to southern Florida looks to be dry today as a big pool of Canadian air\nHas now filtered in through that portion of the country we're going to pick up some rain showers for portions of the mid west\nThen as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a production because they are too predictable on the left all the protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about impeachment\nNot gonna happen it's not going to happen because\nYou're not going to move on it when when you know you want to do well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\n\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we could do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect doors no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that ... that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it\nThe President Trump was ...\nA formation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out so there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course but the people\nThe everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean\nDon't follow it every day and we know people work and some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gay for every single chance to prove her case and she could not that's the reality of this all\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to stand to have\nA preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAh and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh the what what didn't what can we find out the only thing that we didn't find out was Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean the ... if you can point to go to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but when the mirrors ... uh came out and said that uh you know the the her lawyers or you're twenty people we want to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people\nThat you say are witnesses to this actual event but she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right can cooperate and say that anything happened or in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd with those no she could have an answer them over\nA nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as fast for them right because the the story came out that she\nUh and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI that's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we were willing we call them we were going to give them you know and I knew then bay where you have to come to you had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee now where they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance of the left has on the no\nThe only thing the lab test is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you're never believe the uh the the man you had white males on the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of a you're a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that allegation should be enough\n... rarely if we were first roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or does it matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent such as a matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that's yeah so then you get what you want just a multiple unbearable hide for allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those well that's not just say this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be believed not in other cases but just this particular case it must be believe now I Know that they generally said oh woman must be believed but then the women that said well why aren't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being sold the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist are up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nUh everything that they sure while does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test ...\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not fringe Democrats this is the mainstream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence\nWhen the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that all are witnesses that they couldn't cooperate at well the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nUh the the process was even distorted to that extent so to in order to facilitate that and then\nUh the the process was even distorted\nTo that extent so to in order to facilitate that and then\nUltimately it came down to one while it was voted along party lines\nWith with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's\nWhat it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kevin always up there it would have been the exact same ... same right than the division was not created by Trump it was not\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nOf the

we've been saying if the left truly wishes to get rid of the electoral college in the next step also was to get rid of the Senate\nThere you go yeah yeah so you can ... a reporter at NBC News ...\nOr over the weekend on Saturday\nIt may not happen in our lifetimes but the idea that North Dakota and New York get the same representation in the Senate has to change senators representing less than half of the U.S we're about to confirming nominee opposed by most Americans\nOh I don't know if that's true because I saw the poll but was across America that showed a that uh if the FBI did the investigation that's sixty percent of Americans are in favor so I'm right\nWell and I guess they're doing it that lives on the population of the states represented the yes okay okay I'm being those fifty senators in this case\nSo then the senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states\nRight necessarily oh that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with freedom of speech few years back when the luck came out and it was the big thing that you know corporations and any group people should not have free speech right mhm that\nTheir free speech is only for the individual uh but gun rights or for the groups right [laughter] for the militia but not the individual right and we said no the the bill of rights ah is\nAh about the individual and groups of individual ... because you have two people does not mean that you lose your freedom of speech we heard you know the the

Welcome Brian\nThank you for taking my call ... ... as far as to gather all heroes go on the compilation\nIt it wouldn't allow that who was elected president on the Republican side there would have done this to anyone I Would have been ... whoever yo ... says Trump fights back\nHere it's like a lion and and and and and and he just makes me very proud to be an American were actually very proud to say that I voted\nI er I Would say that this by and that I I'm not sure and we ... we will never know but I'm not sure how another Republican would have reacted\nTo the heat on Kavanaugh if they might have withdrawn his nomination and I think that's something to consider is it is it that Trump or wouldn't back down and and he refused to withdraw that nomination that's a possibility I don't know how to quantify that because we'll never know but it's I think we have to consider that possibility\nWell thank you protect like\n... if you'd had a a you took your and but he brings up a point that we've made along we made it last week made of the week before ... ... you know while this is what you get when you get Trump\nNow this would have happened no matter what is this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the less behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past Republicans other Republicans might have been\nApparently not Lindsey Graham but [laughter] but other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the past I've had been quick to eat their own I don't I don't know I Can't say that about a ... because we don't we'll never know if Ted Cruz had won or is he mentioned a Rubio\nOr anybody else another Republican were there or Mike Pence I have no idea\nUh we don't know if if they would have withdrawn their nomination\nUm when the ... this president basically said okay fine we'll do another FBI background check\n'em you know the giving it the entire a vetting process of seven complete background checks [noise] so I don't know I but I Do know that this president has been less willing to back down\nI'm as unpredictable as he may be at times\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes well as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way we guard was of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one\nNot too but a total of four they're really really voting for Ted Cruz and so our time for science I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience than the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions\nMay be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision or you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that\nCame together in most dead on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work\nThere and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because they hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right to sway motivate them more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that the young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that do Democrats are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... that a negative if the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his pack your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nAh to tell her how to a vote when you see the Collins speech\nYeah and and except for ... ... ... ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech or like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the past ... the big past what she shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that\nWe got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick\nOf Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party ... before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican or Republican is we're party right now it's a pretty big party to predict party going from conservatives till the moderate liberal really is just met he when he come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues right there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have a unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had such unity part of it is the fight uh from the president but the president has always had\nThat fight in rhetoric but in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sessions as he still goes after them as he did others early on\nMade you think OK doesn't really know who is picking this really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know well what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham has still be on the Sunday Morning news show saying he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right you you know and that's it because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I think we are light years right now as to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that because that goes back to again what we said the base uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again ... that's ... that's an anomaly often on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp\nAt letting the uh mansions of the world\nAnd even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other and the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards the nature\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believed they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good wailing away with the electoral dollar the Democratic senators won't before they know that's it's not going to have you know it's not the word out but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which gamble never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that tower that castle if you will that wall that mode happens to be built around the nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence Sprite due process\nConstitutional issues not to fame in somebody\nWhen you talk about those are all ... ... moral issues and that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they were able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump the chance to win and twenty twenty again state yeah\nCamilla Harrison Ford Booker right by the way I

Morning shows yesterday some we'll hear\nFrom him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witness was back again and everything else that would be interesting from what it says especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nUh women who met allegations are against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nYeah and he's on the Supreme Court to say yes and there's nothing in the Democrats can do to do it ... there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it and if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's\nOnly really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and give people a motivated to get to\nThe polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get ... Republicans out\nOr is this a because we can we we've seen it I've probably in the past I Can't think offhand up of of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once it

Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans are identified themselves as social is a quarter and a half a Democrat and a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact\nThat they listen to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you

really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from ah the ah the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried\nThrough in that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kinds of other nomination process we may go through a while a Trump's to president but uh you know making some very solid point\nUh the life was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left one do you use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're hit ...\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bernie's come the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about their parents it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been mean to him and called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate James\nI mean he doesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that and\nI don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from a Lindsey Graham\nBut Lindsey Graham's a when she issued this concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the and and on the larger a much larger than a pretty much the treatment of capital by the Democrats and and not the\nNot the liberals with the signs outside look like the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I said\nWe discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have any one\nI have not seen any rational thought were critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case\nWith this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we have made\nWhich are the same one I can see is Lindsey Graham are all ...\nWell I think that we have made\nWhich of those same what I can see is Lindsey Graham are all lead jihad and the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct\nAnd right and you're wrong and reading Frank Bruni column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of\nThe things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lined up\n\nYeah I mean it is again a the\nThey just lack the will to have the debate they have the debate can of the debate so they have to step out of ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what well they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world\nAbsolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's a that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nOh I can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham got and I might in the future\nYou are you running for attorney general right [laughter] I'm only a ... year to general what are you trying to get out of yesterday ... ... well that's it he's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's four trough\nWe've we've said with the simple ten you know a ... argument that will never and I called them simple and arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that aren't [noise]\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\nAnd you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become a Ernie general yeah you know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump's you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they\n... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect [laughter] to try and tell you that they are no they don't but it is the the they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nBand and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate tromp and now he likes Trump\n\nDebate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni\nCan't can't do it eight six six Ninety read I\nWas told

I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge or any kind of Hillary touring with emails there's\nOn that one ... that's ... that's followed that wasn't Republicans fault no I only ally\nThat was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment\nRight well do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nNow with I don't know why they don't get them but what did this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss\nIt is but because the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe used to add about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an end in of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said is that on the ...\nWhich was an ending of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would a prosecutor\nWe said well it what matters fears the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November twenty sixteen and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding Gary and sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence of this happened\nBut he said she said of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it so it\nUh you know or it was you know about\nYou know I I don't I'm I'm trying to think of when you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is or in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah\nAh any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperate and so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nIs and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't or when the seats that they shouldn't be winning\nA in a first term I Believe president and the first midterm afterwards but almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed mhm ah Andy United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans ...\nKnow if you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm and so the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure if I'll be lap when it said she said you know the ... that she would\nLike to ... she would consider running against colon somebody gives me you're the one the lie to him on big gassy now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody would agreement that's what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it\nThe best that we can hope for in any thing is that the truth is told that I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption and now when the specter general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said\nWe're you know we we we've got a couple of allies to don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh those so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make a ... ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from my\nDaughter was in my ... like they don't have to [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went to ... ... doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nWait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties fight Oh yes\nAnd and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd so we don't know what's going to happen there but get us through and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing that's on them yeah\nAnd that's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe've said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want\nAn investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want from three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nThese expects us to review [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million", "show_name": "Red Eye
