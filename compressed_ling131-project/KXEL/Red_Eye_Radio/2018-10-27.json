be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that has gone on I mean there are ... you get that every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other article standing well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just yeah I mean everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety four where they weren't even close\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey on the Delmarva will see heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas all the way up through well at least Long Island and then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio\nFrom where I live to just uh you know several miles north and the tax rate varies greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences\nThe Bible my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm\nA yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... where's your your taxes are higher\nAnd in with a lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't we're not talking the super rich more I learned about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and\nSolid Republican voters some who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and\nTheir only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message by Republican congressman ... and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to Ben paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yea which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that made by ... that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes so many of them coming out now I'm\nGoing to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going and we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt that we've also talked\nAbout the care of it right and they were in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears it along expected decline is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse it to the your caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us but the steel and and automobiles the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said when the president\nCame out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable that he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWhat was the story last week about Ford grumbling gonna be allusion a billion dollars and they believe the tariffs are going to the are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or or feeling it already and every dealership and every day all ... members of the steel tariffs really been affects that we're from China which has increased the costs from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old them because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in a price because of steel costs and now because of tariffs\nCost and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about\nA manufacturing people would manufacturing jobs at a technical skills ton of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry when you're talking about farmers that are dream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you started wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because from the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now yeah there\nWas a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt and it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers are and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a poor trade with with Canada\nOr any nation\nThat they're selling to those\nFarmers if they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war chair of the that went into place\nA or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this was one of the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar\nA handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our law says All right and we're ... we're we're ... or out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession the problem with bailing out all the banks are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government\nOr during the recession or in two thousand eight and to the end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine they\nThere were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk but they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well then it made all the banks look risky\nAnd that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm ... you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else or another nation in this case ... and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nOur discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this uh election we've talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party ... in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good\nDemocrats or a complete match\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the old you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nUh I think uh\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected headset or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker icon for any story and voila just start listening wrote king dot com\n[noise] man have you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation eastern dot com it's cooking spurs news and entertainment website like Netflix\nYou can watch brand new original trucking show some videos me just for us truckers and you won't find it anywhere else\nOf transportation nation dot coms trucking shows in videos or on demand so you can watch whenever you want\nOr you have to sign up and start watching was free that's perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com\nWhite voice of eastern Iowa\nNew start treaty bleak K.

I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say is that every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country and say please say that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left ...\n... ... and and this device I'd give the president as Mr President people already know what you think mhm forget about what have you ever ... writes everybody's asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think you've got to turn it around this one American\nTo say ... forget about what have you with you ... writes everybody's asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around this what America needs to know is not what you think got a legal immigration or America thinks on illegal immigration you need to get an answer out to Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue or ... I mean winter lose the house and joins ... it's still going to be an issue take it to the Democrats mhm\nThey force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about and how many hundreds of times and the prices act you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since really care what what was that was that\nTwo thousand eight two thousand oh no no it was before ... it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board\nKnows while we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios\nOkay yeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling scam misty um yes it was because it was two thousand eight\nIt was to find out what was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay is one of our personnel in and then\nThen it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh he was that the conservative a convention and and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\n\nA and it fell short of a ... eleven days at first started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's why I say because I ... I was out here I was so low\nI remember going you know we saw that and uh and I was so low and I was and so the the\nBut this has been going on for a long long time if you think about and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy said day\nMight have a better chance of it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative\nSo much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... capital [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote\nIt but but it's been over Thirteen Years but this has been a huge issue a huge issue is that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the\nRepublicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit that they want open borders that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety right I\n[noise] ...

they\nGoing through right now they know you talk about freak out mode\nThere's someone wrote the story again you know because they they did this series on a on cable I no longer will stories of people winning the lottery and just ended horribly\nI'm an someone did the story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nOr you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell even your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt that when you claim the prize\nThe word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nThen people come at you believing you didn't earn it so it does mine\nAnd they disconnect the phone the next day and left\nAnd\nYou know because if if I'm sure it became crazy with relatives you didn't know you had in the whole thing\nUm and and\nThat's the real you know that's a real risk of it because that's like we have the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing and they were trying to win the money\nAnd their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there relative a wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that you know and sometimes it's not not even people view you know\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but nonprofits non stop\nKnocking at your door you know and you want to give back I'm sure most people would\nBut you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that a way if you fulfilled every request there would've been\nMuch more time and when I was younger me winning the lottery in these days would be like what a hassle\n[laughter] well I Would watch thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want it the one time payout it's somewhere around a third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall prize a one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars that's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already you went to bed poorer\nThan than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nYou know the story always goes you was one of the least rich guys and the Senate\nMom and and you woke up richer than a middle and end the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop\nAnd park it anywhere you know what I mean\nI mean ... where are you going to take that I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred\nMillion in the back it would it would a ... and there's the bit disturbed there's there's nothing I'm I'm not finding I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I had to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle ... uh I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm I and\nI don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life\nI have a a friend who uh a friend or family member who a bad boy at one time was working for a a multibillion it\nUm and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nBecause there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule is very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener thinks we are\nTalking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy I found a multi billionaire although well at least one listener thinks we are um but but\nThe point was that there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes\nUh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to know\nI couldn't have lost anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run\nMy in laws there are laws without raising the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you gotta pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're going to give it all away that's what I mean they're going to be a fulltime job is gonna be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I like this life fight that right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's play out of a let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older you're like well like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life\nI like my life well yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know what I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that a five minute this is one dumped off it goes through a mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other low we that we've ever done really I mean it's not I never think that outside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio someone somebody comes up until today\nA little shocking we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really I mean it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse that we have the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go home to ... that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist so the mentality sort of the same so I but the the the thought is and so there are still you know challenges that I think um every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my ... because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things that I can think about it basically keep death the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges the problems are taken away and all of sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you\nKnow I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he can he developed a game and he sold it ah I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about I was at this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living at a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was ... I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird odd place to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's here's the problem\nWith being famously wealth or like the the ... the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has changed security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because they are ... there are threats against you all the\nTime as one of the that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talking about the guy who won the big lottery ran was actually what the uh kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever I played on the money yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "27"}
