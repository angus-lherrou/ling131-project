powerful word to bury power or um you know I Do like some of the people in the\nOther party I mean I'm a I'm a conservative no matter what I Love what Trump do it um\nYou know I I Can't believe that not that Kennedy by now uh you know and and the mob India however you know I hate saying it it it\nIt's over taken a day and and you know I grew up in the eighties we didn't have this kind of hay and

stoke silver junior Joe you're on with mark\nMartin Morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic I uh\nI'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I Want it to all the you know Facebook [noise] I've I've shut down based but just because even if I had it with my friends and family only I still found endless arguments on there for I mean just\nFor no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um\nIt it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the main Trump's sometimes you know a ... but with my sister even before the election actually have a job and\n... ... maybe some day she'll come around she obviously got I'm fat yeah down in socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinion I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw\nA but it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way\nI worked at a at a station ... in Los Angeles as I said\nI don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a ... have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a auto Twenty years or something and then um one day and the host said to me you know mark a her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said I'm oh wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that eventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics they disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that that\nThey're just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side who are just skirting but are brought up the topic because it does happen is this something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMark it's great to talk to you I'm I'm a Republican and conservative my whole life then I went into the military right after high school and um you get most of the people um\nThat I met in the military were which are because they felt like the Republicans are the only one that would ever support a raise for you know the military pay\nAs I kind of you know just said okay well there for being that I'm for them um and then as time went on um when\nI'm a first are you\nA Gulf walk him about um I just remember listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to\nFind someone that talking about this ... at the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time the car and he just wanted to listen and you know I found conservative radio and\nYou know I never really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you going for them and it was like people started\nComing to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't always be pushing anything on them and\nUm and when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from me friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know for someone who's\nJust you know terrible and I'm just like you're going to stand idly mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him and the conservatives say anything to make our country better and yeah I still\nSee people rallied against and like I'm just like wait a minute we'll be greatest economy in the in the country's ever see you know we have I mean you see jobs for truck drivers should at least five thousand dollar bonuses for someone to start that job\nYou know I mean\nCan you actually jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money so you know if you get the right to ... you get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck working construction and\nYou know everyone seems to be still upset anything close\nTo stand back and look at what's going on but you know I I had a friend telling me right to my faith that I get so mad at you and I when I read the things you oppose\nThat I just want to shoot you in the head and she laid a hand say with a guy my cat and I miss it so hurt by that and\nYeah I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and\nIt just seems like a lot of my friends are just like what you know we can't do you find that demand that because she's like Donald Trump can I just don't want to be around here anymore and it\nIt is hurtful and um yeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of all of this I'm a transgender woman though a lot of people on the right hated me for a chance at the lowest hated me because I like Donald Trump\nAnd you know my ... a lot of people my family is like me because I've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a chance to people that look like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like really doesn't\nYou know and so it's like all these angles coming at me telling any then I'm wrong for being so I Am and I don't think that anything or some might take people telling you they can't accept you for who you are and and then it's just horrible [noise]\nWell I feel your pain and I use the bill Clinton line but I can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you I Can't imagine what you're going through a\n... it's tough enough or the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us let alone or when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nUh to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and home my phone has a whole this kind of stuff\nWhen we're not to just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations but that may ...\nHim as a volunteer work for a ... I was running for Congress in my area can Gerry Connolly and he gets out of it is an army veteran and his they combat is also African American and tear economy this older white guy who's been there

like minded people but you know in this world\nIf or when I ask people many good friends do you have and some people breathe seemed on and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way and then we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think said\nThere's someone I don't like I'll have to get to know them better\nUh it it's tough life is very challenging and and to be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have a different colors of said we've reached a new level where your political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else so my advice to you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give

and so that's what I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you\nBut I think we're looking at it in a different sense that I think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more it's the media so and ... and they're out there they don't care now that I'm trying to hide what tent that they believe in\nAnd they don't care because of that they they get so many we find that

your take on that\nYeah you while you you may have points I should have brought up thank you Daniel Lee the influence from the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watching Johnny Carson\nWell uh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal\nBut he never had it out there now again names will comedian but but the media is such a powerful rule because so many people that's all they hear right to major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff to talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his

you're right they don't even know there is any more they don't hide they act like advocates and they're not journalists are only\nProblem I have with it is is that this is supposed\nTo be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an immature a point of view in a way to proceed with and then look at things it means that\nYou can I'll pull out of their people and that's not what America's about [noise]\nI I got to answer your but I've got aunts my producer who just told me he said the Anderson Cooper no because I thought of a Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give publicity but that's the guy and loves it it's about\nAnd so I'm playing right into it you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my

McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's doing let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not\nA ... million you know what shepherd I been one what kind of America do we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you're saying but now you're national forecast for video roadblock\nNo one's climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook will be warmer in the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and Warner the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecast should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen\nIn Denver you're on with mark\nAnd mark how're you doing well\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned briefly a little while ago about a social media and the fact that it's having on relationships friends family colleagues\nUm I've had experiences where I I quit the race for\nFive years ago because I just couldn't turn green in some of the things people are writing and\nYou know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and you know say something I might regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because\nIt was revealed on things but how I felt you know\nBack when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\n\nWhy she started to go in your direction first of all I I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out I'm a someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you kind of became\nI've learned not to say much about politics and the ... when they know I'm On talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media right\nThen I Do some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever used Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media especially when we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nThe little marked a a lot to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I ah our our list do a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know both the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians work\nAware that the U.S electorate we're going to do what's best to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us and that worked out in the end so all that or if it's stuff that came off of a\nA Paul Kennedy and I'm a\nAt a Charles Adler and a fan of right and uh in in green or all of that probably helped a\nJet Obama or get a Trump elected because he was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront and a lot of people for a lot of white people voted for President Obama\nAnd then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another challenge and things got worse or we were very very disappointed it uh you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review social pointed at it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise]\nI think if they voted for him because they want to show they were in prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is and he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who's the rent Reverend Wright and re pretended that the you know they weren't as friends anymore you could see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people come pick on Trump that for the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far on left he he really has he got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nA notice appointment to me I I never expected\nIt's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has he got closer and closer he hide that for for half a second a notice appointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar that admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in ... Illinois your honor with mark\nHey mark I've got two observations and then a point to make a first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise]\nIt's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise in the power of the individual\nNot the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for each individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers\nAs individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but the air fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\n... you said that very very well and by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights that they're so far out there than you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ... but they're fascist themselves\nThey even when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so that yeah I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to protect the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left the adult Democrats that you can count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he's six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Marcus or on red eye radio\nWith ... radio told ... ...
