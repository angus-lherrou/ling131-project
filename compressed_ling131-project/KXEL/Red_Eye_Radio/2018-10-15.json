[noise] they assume that they could slander and a large role person but that I disagree with politically and get their way but [noise] um [noise] and they've been doing the same to me\nWe're politically and get their way but [noise] um\nAnd they've been doing the same to go to trial for two years but\nUh it's really come to a head well suitable to care at all ... and I think we need to

they come yeah they they don't\nGo ahead ... we\nAre huge that's yeah that's been there ... nacho since the last two years with Trump\nTheir play book and I remember Harry Reid saying that Romney didn't pay his taxes you heard from some of the middle ear on it was a lie but he said it was affective well they'll do anything in the book and the worry is it looks like they could win the house representatives and if they do you can't imagine what the next two years of going to be like for President Trump and for all of us run\nA tried and it's the idea that you're selfish ends justify your selfish mange\nI'm that's what the Democrats are using as they're guiding principle um they're selfish and those are are justified rather selfish lanes\nAnd ... and they also think they have troops on their side they're arrogant as I said\nAnd when you arrogant and you think if you think you have the truth then you can do anything right at the end of the means are justified by the ends right or the actually either way you said it works because they just feel like in say anything and do anything because we're evil and they're good\nWill actually thought they could overturn a two hundred years of

five\nYou're going to pick up the potential for snow\nWe'll see mainly all rain as you get into Oklahoma and north Texas\nBecause I think to me the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated and and what went on there the idea\nThat allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is that raises is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven guilty he was guilty just because he's accused of it and so maybe that influence on people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections but Robert I I think of your call and hang in there okay\nThank you thank you very much twenty five there so let's go to a okay\nDavid you think people are voting were or dead huh God David in Cedar Rapids day\nUm [noise] okay what is it is is that a grandfather and my mother and grandmother cell passed away a notice that\nI joined the sheer lane county Republican caucus committee you know people who are at the coach who are going to take a look at you know all of a [noise] you know and they see how people are voting [laughter]\nAnd I noticed that no one looking records that for some reason my grandfather and grandmother and my mother all voted for Obama place even though they die before [noise]\nDid you report it to anybody tried to take some action\nPlace even though they die before [noise]\nDid you report it to anybody tried to take some action\nI it it's just that you know it it was kind of like a yelling at a stone wall\n[noise] you know they weren't willing yeah no ... this\nIs a real problem with voting integrity in this country\nThat was known for years of people in Chicago that people voted in Chicago but now across the country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity election system anything could happen it's amazing when you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won\nBecause I Believe that we're finding that kind of fraud so that people wrote in in California you know you can vote by DMV and they admitted that thousands of people voted then they said there was some snakes with voting machines\nWe had a real problem when the you can trust the outcome of the election\nWell the thing is is that how the ... Republican any a carcass committee changed\nHere in Cedar Rapids said we got a whole\nNew Patrick people in all ... people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my assault is actually counted and so we all these younger people says I Love this idea\nI'm just going to make sure that this guy over here that I don't trust anything illegal\nAnd that's how we changed from late Democrats ... Republicans pretty in this last election\nWell that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take into account illegal immigrants right if illegal immigrants are voting and then I asked my point that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants to vote Republicans aren't going another election at least nationally uh in our lifetime\nOr there's no hope when you let people vote who aren't qualified or are not citizens of United States\nYou brought up a great well election\nActually got to get a little something there that they're [noise] okay assault ends on how you treat the end of the [noise]\nIf you treat people who may be here illegally but are contributing to society because I worked on many aware out agency jobs or there are plenty of illegal so we're working\nBut as long as you treat them like human beings and you know being angry protests are illegal just realized that are so much else for so long that we know integrated at people that you know\nIn a in another way it should've been there in the first place but because they are good to us and we are good to them [noise] maybe the idea that illegals were probably no\nRepublican has not ... not\nQuite as it's not\nJust because of title want to get on to our topic necessarily the problem is\nIf you don't have a way of entering the country legally then you're sovereignty your borders me nothing I mean there's a big topic I don't want to go into it yeah I certainly think people should be treated well but whether they should be allowed into your country is another issue you have borders or you don't\nBut I don't want to open up back and forth is right now\nUh you know it it's bigger than just a few minutes it is not a matter of treat them well in fact I don't even know I teach at night and many of my students may not be here legally they they greet people that's not the point I fault the government for not having a system that makes sense for all of us that's the real issue\nAnd speaking of issues let me know what you think after eight six six Ninety red eye that's also eight six six or seven\nThirty three thirty nine let's see we have time for another call this in this segment Charles been waiting Sheryl in spots where does that New Jersey\nI flew in New Jersey and New Jersey Mrs all from Nineteen sixty nine Mrs Hillary

if it's all orchestrated by her because she laws if you'd done such a great job but the fact is you're right the certainly the playbook Solomon skin Obama followed that\nAnd taking over the young right there so they get indoctrinated for the most part and he knew if you capture them when they're young you'd have for a lifetime and that's why the nice guy a you know nothing at the last caller you name but the idea that the you know if you're just tree legal immigrants well that's okay 'cause they're good people you know we know they're good people but that's not the point\nYou know what I often say for years I've been saying it's amazing it's not an easing that students graduate and they're on the left\nWhat's amazing is if anybody goes or a school system has come out as conservatives\nAre they just don't hear the other side they never hear our side actually when I think about I'm pretty optimistic that we could win elections after all that indoctrination because eventually you get a paycheck because there was the second\nOne is the government taking all my money what I don't agree with this stuff right but they've got to grow up they gotta get out in the

thirty nine let's go to Gina in New York City 'cause I hate to admit I think you are right you know but\nI'm going to agree with you in part not going to disagree with you on on the part the Republicans are such backwards pools that even despite the Kavanaugh hearings and this by all the people that are saying we're going to go to the polls and we're going to both of them at crotch I guarantee you\nThe house will lose twenty seats at least minimum Republican Party and we haven't been able to weed out these rhino slobs that are sending us to the left\n[noise] yeah well I Do agree with you as you said you agree with me in part I Do agree with you that the Republicans are probably gonna lose the house now I don't want to um usually an optimist but I just want to be real it doesn't I don't know how many seats it takes twenty something\nBut the fact is that um and we're in trouble and it doesn't look good because the mayor of the house is done on an individual basis or area by area state by state\nSo it sure seems to me that uh we're in trouble and we can easily lose a house represents I don't think we're going to lose a Senate but we are going to lose the house of representatives\nEnough people don't go out and vote is very very scary what's happening let's go to a how 'bout that Curtis in Graham North Carolina Curtis here on with mark\n[laughter] Hi [noise]

you have fight hard for him and that's part of my message tonight if you don't get out there and vote we're going to be in trouble let's go to Fred in Tallahassee, Florida Fred you're on with mark\nAnd mark Gary higher it real well how are you doing I'm near Boone good yeah the uh\nMost of all they are corrupt or the Obama administration has is known to pot a\nNo he was big into more of an off\nColor started voting mob mob but first\nI got a full load for on boats you only got in beach ball and that was a real ... oh my dad was a staunch\nConservative more and I'm In law and child was new buddies who wanted to go there and done all kinds of stuff\nYou know you might be a different party and I have a few days for a deal is\nBut you got alone and you know you can have a conversation without it turning into a ... it's a ball and\nSo that's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody's you know in the right to be before\nYou go in and sounds like you to go but I Will say that everybody\nElse out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me but at least go in and do boot based on emotion you you have President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen and so you're the woman that I remember that was years ago maybe it is again\nA vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or the principles of course there's another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you that's most of them don't know our point of view what I often use the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re or want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound harmless\nA job of a business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics java business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be you won't have any work or they won't hire you will do lay you off when they won't hire your friends\nLive on the job of a business that give you a livable wage and it's not the job of government that decide what wage to give you\nThat is what the Soviet Union did last week communism is that's what's socialism is\nAnd as most of the young people but they've never heard the other side where does money come from I said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money the tone it just takes it in ... from some group of people in the foreign attacks and give it gives it bothers when students here the snake I never heard that\nI never heard that before\nSee conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course it changed the climate change when it gets very cold just seeing these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily that the government should do some bureaucrats shouldn't do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\nThis is tough to be on on our side and it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections he's one of the President Trump won with all the things that against him\nA and let's go to David in Greenwich uh let's see where that is in Greenwich New Jersey and sounds like\nHi I'm David\nGreene morning thanks for taking my phone call um\nI I guess ... points on that you know President Trump has hated for what he says and and I get it it's not what he does you know let's not forget in this country that President Obama came that I didn't vote for him but I like them as charismatic the money in this country and you should know this uh\nI'm as you're teaching the money in this country tied up and it went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back\nOut again President Trump cannot force corporations don't invest money or make things happen I mean he's a businessman he's a wheel on your show he's hated for what he said not what he done second I think the people in this country should understand that the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations\nJust like if you want I wanted to start our own right I radio corporation political party we couldn't do it too so when they take it so personally thinking this is Austin is his name is not an awesome them to corporations and you know that's that's how they listed myself again I think to vote in this country\nYou should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five so you know how to vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties comment that\nAs far as the civil war in this country I had a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina I'm On so I mentioned the civil war and he said it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing simple about well we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave come a long time in Congress and that because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves\nA and you know and understand the question it's it's a it's a screw in question but if somebody turned around tomorrow and said I mean bottom the bus drivers are taking the bathroom\nFor a cat at a fast food restaurant and he says Mr Schumer Mr or ... or or or Mr selling so expose themselves to me in the bathroom do they get a hearing from that do they not get a hearing I mean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with a capital area\nBut ah this country's out of control but doesn't straighten out there couldn't be a civil war where the national guard protects our borders and if nothing else anyone listening out there should understand that\nYou know there are countries out there that are that are against us that don't like us and they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this has gone ... years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start tearing ourselves apart internally someone's going to make a move on us trend\nI appreciate you taking my culture\nAbsolutely no ... you know you're pretty articulate about it the knowing I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give a\nTo see because just because you can answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on because I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom just because I have a master's round of a doctor but I Know people doctors at just as they have a degree doesn't make them very wise\nSo I don't think I Want to test for voting I Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble\nBut I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I I Know I certainly want don't want to make it easier like you can ... a motor voting rights you can do our voting the day of the election things that you know or or voting even three months before things happen I thought it was a problem in Florida I think you know where\nWhere people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks\nI Want to be a reason for it I don't want to go out of my way to make it difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador they saw it on line and they were bullets being shot at them obviously and bloody some of them to vote and they held up I don't know ... I Can't even take a caller on the hell it whenever they were using to signify that they have voted we we don't take that seriously\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected headset or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker I'd gone for any story and voila just start listening road gang dot com\nErekat here for the St Christopher truckers relief fund if you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't you\nEvery year thousands of truckers lose their jobs homes and more when a medical problem causes financial hardships but with your donation to the St Christopher truckers relief on you can help get them and their families back on the road donate today a trucker ... that's ... responded dot org ... today at truckers bonded dot org\nVoice of eastern Iowa\nUsed ...

seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you that well we've been outta the last couple of hours\nWe've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left and the right and that's where I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years that I think it's the second civil war\nAnd you've been reacting to that on line I mean ... through your calls but first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know what the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits\nLiberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the era of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night\nAnd President Reagan will ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and double Neal way was the speaker of the time he said that's the day time does that night we're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power\nAnd oh yeah probably now you can't even have a drink at night 'cause look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh it has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes\nNow lying as commonplace as with ... with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and then he was a called on that he said well it would work didn't it\nWas a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of a group allowing for women to be gang rape so much so that he was in New York Times didn't print that accusation\nBy the way she her own has suggested Kevin I'm did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right\nYou don't want to serve the process of being uh the uh the proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated afford but you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love what Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone then find science officer or want to Ford's attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to lead the harm Kevin O's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those extra Senator Hatch so that the goalposts moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the crude across the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they too are left to screw up before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nAnd he said he was born and records deeply concerned by the allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nThis is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin I was engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's tests on one of the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAnd this is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of higher score to land on trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment and the burden is on nominee the burden on an army to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as they're unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation then voila you've never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make it to the press but there it is again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul and there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of America\nTell me what you think of all of this application of the Simpson of innocence and self righteousness of those on the left and the fool's on our side and if you agree

polls\nIf you have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent\nPush at those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got to curb margin that's all grumpy and you know wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nUh I always set up a little card table with a bullet candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents and you can make a significant

personal touch I've run for office of course in California last\nAh Republicans don't usually win in California but I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I've seen it in the audience is where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and they almost all say they never have and when they meet someone and you had a great point and the reason I'm decent that's how you get a vote\nA then Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then he went over to consultants and TV and I think we went to strength in some ways let's go to April in New York

comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether they were going through a civil war and I\nBelieve that there's a difference the civil war I think we are going to prove something similar to that but on the civil war both sides are very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death\nFor what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and and the young people there and they don't they only hearing one site we're not organized conservatism that organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people is that they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist we're all the young kids in ... in school or you know in the high schools and colleges the minute they have a conservative view they screen that oh how can any person\nAs a young person in in college be strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people the ... the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing\nTo be liberal so all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be a good side they think\nThey're on the good sign of being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be you know throwing rocks and and cocktails through windows like some of the and the thing is you know group does but we're not serving our\n... being too quiet and I don't think every\nGroan American that's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nLittle liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go on for an invite the other friend I'm going here look I'm going to prompt us we're going to go down and I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in is like\n... a protest is but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there was a different point of view we are being like um bullied\nTo just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer oh and and what they're saying Cuomo what he just said lately that\nPresident Trump's he's trying to get all ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent it was something that happened at a metropolitan club I think they\nSaid Republicans have a ... yeah I\nDid you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it\nHe's he's President Trump\nThis is the way the Republicans handle things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose to go after the ... set them up I jump in in ... but the kids and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me\nMy husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watch it and he's twenty or Twenty one and they show how Hitler isolated the young people got him to summer camp they were separated from their parents they only heard what Hitler was saying and telling them what we view our strong we are\nGood we will be the and the kids carrying with smiling faces\nThey don't know what they that they're being the top again and we're letting it happen I feel very bad 'cause if I knew there was something going on\nAnd I wouldn't be the only one there and the police would be there to protect and make the children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know and I'm only letting it happen because it trying to be polite\nBut they're they're gathering all the young people with the media and play Taylor Swift and all these other singers Madonna I mean they're not thinking in school they're not teaching them to think independently and in college if they don't think what the crowd there'll be just slashed\nWhat do you think did you do because I don't think it's a war that's fair because that civil war the two sides fighting equally\nYeah we we should consider to be more passionate about the first thing I Want to say you you had on TV obviously you're very good\nWell here's some I have some optimism for you but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this is it's not a wonder that students come out and the liberal because that's all they ever here it's a wonder that any of them come out as conservatives because they realize that if you doctrine ate them you get them early been that's the way they're gonna think can be except for this\nWhoever the president is seems to make a difference when Reagan was president ... more Republicans\nAre the fact that Trump is president

class\nThey they're Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up in Obama um years complete my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter too\nYou know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and basically\nAnd the Obama years so we've got this generation that we've got another generation that's coming up
