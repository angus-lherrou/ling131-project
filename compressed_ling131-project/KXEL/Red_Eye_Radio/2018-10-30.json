down\nA warning you you're a ... alert coming up in mind but being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because there was a cool place to sit on the porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess at that point oh I I still do the people I had known before but new people to move into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\n[laughter] and I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory um so it would give you another one that that's not from my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point in the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U.S has grown by more than three acts\nMore than three times larger average new home sized now compared to the United states but one of the things we know is that when your house gets larger and you're like get large it gets larger the separation from your neighbors gets larger and you end up having fewer of those relationships in your community and so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot\nAbout what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other more\nAnd there is there's a move in some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes ... but\nOne of the things to try to do is move from a big huge back back like I Confess we have at our house\nTo a front porch which has closer to the proximity what are your neighbors are walking by\nThere is happiness it's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just of getting to converse with your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house\nBut frankly having even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch or because you didn't have the air conditioning it was something you went through together humans are relational beings we are social animals were not just mounds\nOur verbs we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people\nAnd a lot of times shared experiences even if they're on the perfect\nOr become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue on your on your fourteen year old or when you're a seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future memory\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem though it's not about relationships or at least I don't think it is ... this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence shura\nThe next generation has been or opportunity is higher income or education and they live longer what happened\n[noise] [noise] yeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's a new consensus emerging in the last five to seven years um but the number one health crisis in America is actually loan let us ten years ago you couldn't find anybody at the national institutes of health\nThat would have told you anything other than obesity as the number one driver of health problems are and and public health expenditure and the U.S now about Seventy percent\nOf obesity is viewed as a phenomenal up while they that sort of a downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends if people get lonely and then they get fat and so at the near term biggest driver of costs at American health care is obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight\nAnd a a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folk\nAre obese but most of that as a downstream consequence of loneliness\nOpioid addictions overdoses suicide a whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and their lives not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community\nNot having membership and a lot of organizations this is really new we've had\nPretty good public health data on what people die of\nFour eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time in the last six years at even two years is declining like expectancy in Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy\nThis year Tony a pain organizer third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\nAnd it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose and opioids is one of the the big drivers\nMost all of that is related to decline and community that's about to say there are also\nEconomic consequences but there was an interplay between declining economics and declining community\nSo bunch of places in America that we think about sort of be industrialized saying you have the economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meaningful shared work with other people and the declining sense of participation\nAnd neighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or or the prices are vicious cycles\nAll right that covers the problem is most of which I think we were the Begley aware of all not not as well outlined certainly as in the book them but the second part of the subtitle why we

Court\nHe goes through everything and then at the last minute they bring out the pictures of him at five years old dressed as Hitler we yeah we were by that time we haven't gotten to the boom yet because remember who said we need to go to the ... what was that story\nWhenever I had started to go on social media\nWhenever I decided to go on social media I have to go with the attitude that this is for entertainment purposes only ... you can't take it seriously\nBecause you have a ton of not cases out there and a ton of those not cases are in the media\nYeah and so you go in ... you're not going to have an intellectual discussion you know days like yesterday\n\nI Will admit it at times I have to [laughter] hold back on the frustration as to where the narrative is going because I Know what you and I really like\nTo talk about we really like to talk about the\nUh we love to talk about policy we love to talk about issues we love to talk about economics those are the things that really really dry but those are the passions that we had because we we understand we believe that that's what will make the country great or not great\nMhm and it has gotten harder from\nThirty years ago until now when I started\nTo get to that point\nYou and I are determined that's what we're going to do not that we're going to ignore or anything else\nBut you and I've had this discussion we're going to you know we we want to make sure that you know that's what we love doing we're not going to get down into the sewers everybody does it or not everybody but a significant portion of the media does each and every day and it gets to be ridiculous and it gets to be childish\n\nWell it doesn't serve any purpose really no it doesn't um and and that's that's the the um at times it can be amusing but but but frankly it's it's useless altogether\nOr there was no real purpose for it or when you talk about the the basic fundamental ideas and then talk about those ideas being implemented a policy that's where it starts to come together but nobody wants nobody wants to have that conversation anymore but don't\nI I I just think the the uh the art of debate the art of debate the the artist debate is gone it's it is a apes that no one is interested in it\nYou know I Would love to hear a on a stage a condo Lisa rice versus a Hillary Clinton please make that happen but we'll never see it because you you create\nThe smoke and then make sure that that ensures that it can't ever happen I'm ... and the people that that we would love to see run for office\nLikely don't have the will to run for office simply because they know that the debate part of it is really over\nOne of the issues of the Democrats claim is the number one issue has been climate change really for the last Thirty years it's been since I started with some really when I got in this really when you started hearing a lot of damage eighty nine right yeah I don't ever remember one debate of actual scientist\nOr a national debate of scientists from both sides by all my heart shrug that policy politicians\nThat that it and that's that's the that's where it's going to end I mean we're never going to get to the scientific community because again you can create the smoke or ... or scientists\nWere strictly political agenda who are challenge a bad moment by another scientists\nAnd that's all we're asking for [laughter] really\nThink about that on that issue the Democrats claim is the biggest issue that is destroying the world does anybody ever remember one national debate\nOr discussion\nBetween those who believe that climate change is caused by man and those who aren't sure versus those who say no\nUh no no never that's the state\nOf the United states when it comes to actual discussing the issues that's a key

accusations\nAgainst their opponents the ultimate bean that an incoming president colluded with the Russians to hack\nThe election mhm and they pounded that year in and year out you know it's uh when when you look at it and we just said you know talked about you know the whole lock her up thing with Hillary Clinton ... how the Democrats have jumped on that thing and see how in civil he is this is how radical they are they're staying lock her up lock her\n... and we'd just explain why\nBut we had right earlier that to\nHave the analysis of the Democrats running on health care increase wages and getting rid of government corruption white admitted they only what's the what is the only government corruption that we know of what is the the the biggest ally looked into the living room\nOf government corruption many people believe it's that Hillary absolutely broke the law and was not prosecuted because of it\nIt's ... it's the entire Russian collusion as we're learning more it's the allegation from the Democrats over and over again that this president ... go you know a a as in their own words\nAre committed treason because he colluded with the Russians to hack the election than it was changed the outcome of the election and what have we learned in that time in that time we ... we have learned it is the opposite than it was the Democrats and the Hillary campaign\nThat actually paid money to a law firm that funneled that money to an opposition research firm which funnel that money to a former British spy who got on verified information that he claims\nUnbearable I'd still to this day on true I think it's safe now since there's never been any evidence in uh over two and a half years of investigation a bit false information from people close to the Kremlin\nThat Donald Trump did all these heinous things that they used to try they wanted to destroy\nHis campaign when they couldn't do it they try to destroy the legitimacy of a presidential election in twenty sixteen they also took that information and used it to get\nA secret warned against the opposition parties campaign you won corrupt possible corruption that's corruption\nYeah as absolute ... how do

responsibility to point out what is clearly\nBlatantly falls but she thinks it's right\nOr looking here at some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump\nFor his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs\nThat's good news though for Republicans facing a lecture and with voters said Trump\nAnd the economy are the big issues the latest rash for some reports national television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still rate has performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positive to continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic uh a performance good or excellent marks for months ago\nWhen it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June\nForty four percent consider his performance poor bought\nThe Gabby out here just six percent rape national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're llamas were not in a war you know new a new war people don't care right ah the me see uh a survey this is what does this here the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties uh for most days in recent months speaking at a high a fifty one percent\nTwo weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the presidency on the Rasmussen poll predictably eighty eight percent of Republicans in ... was doing a good or excellent job of handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the G O P voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen uh that uh he believes just a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approval today back and fifty percent black voter approval at record high\nWell\nSo we're talking about the economic can inform but overall they say ... black approval right now at a record high\nYeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question as it is without ... what is what is what are the American people thinking right but but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about\nI mean in part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out you know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy\nBut but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before Kavanaugh there were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but\nThey're still never tropics they're still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while I ... a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of the right so there's that\nThat part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building\nLooked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terror of no terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debate on very real issues\nWith no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the endgame must be protecting the constitution because the process is being with old it was it was all but shredded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh\nAh they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately of works I think\nTo the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've\nNever seen it in a one thing I just want to bring up here 'cause we're talking about the different uh you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump ...\nWhatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news indoors a bed or ... and they claim you know you hear the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news a conservative Dallas Morning news with the conservative Dallas Morning news here there's no way that you can be a conservative and support paid or work number Ted Cruz no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not\nYou're not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the before you could talk ... former conservative columnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels any posted a picture of him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a or a Twitter ... much like it was most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Case ec\nAh who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives

unity do I have to go any further ribs it\nNever happened every president calls for unity every person calls for unity and then they go out and they do what\nThey express what they believe and they're roughly half the people agree and half the people disagree as soon as you have an opinion you had created a divisive atmosphere how stupid are we\n\nHow stupid is the media rather not stupid there\nThey believe that it gets to their advantage but every politician calls for unity and as soon as you open your mouth and say here's what I'm going to do a significant portion of the population disagrees with you [laughter] it is impossible\nFor a politician to create unity in a country\nCan we move on now\nAre we going to are we going to continue living as fairy tale world well the

Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about in twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course been under the funding mechanism and then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it and another way\nPremiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen and the end of\nLast year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know it then\nWhy wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go and it's going by\nYeah of us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich did\nAnd and and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it by because it's one of the top issues than Americans care of all because\nHere's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the sentiment by the American people is shifting on health care and this this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling us this is what they want and this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich was one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do\nThe Newt Gingrich wrote it because he saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way we got criticism ... we got criticism we got criticism when we said they're not repealing Obamacare I stopped saying that we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was pulling bought\nThe mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right\nAnd so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately that should have been the president and and and this is why we have said\nThat we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things it's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with the Medicare for all\nSo we don't have a monopoly running our health care system of government monopoly running our health care system\nAnd this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for and they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just sent me whatever and I'll sign right\nBecause the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any keep fighting you know a lot of people but tell us the last couple of weeks with the like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm\nYou've got to take the hardy shoes and one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits said well you know there are things that ... that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman\nBut you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but what are the main concerns the number one thing that this president did as candidate was to what ... well acknowledge the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation a note Donald jing what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well this regulation is the is the problem you have the right now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem\nYou have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved this president easily\nCould point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up as a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to curb\nWhat they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now is choking in hospitals it's choking employers and as a result who was it that pays\nThe American people in premiums and so you\nAnd edit and frightening and when he got out and in payments to the insurance company\nThat's out and and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult\nYou know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't and has we'll have so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care is well within this we'll hop in\nA new unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for all\nRight well and then that case he's going to have started talking about yeah 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done\nBecause if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore hell let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when we really didn't ... because that was to cry and then the president finally had to admit no well no we did\nGet rid of all of a bomb and care\nBut I mean but that's ... by the way that is part of the the ... you know you're not talking about people not wanting bay that's part of the problems we had with the right we should look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I did yes he did no we didn't know and people would argue with us why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy costs is coming from the regulation that are still in place the hospitals and employers\nAnd by what the you know those those policies and plants have to cover and who pays that we do\nWe're still paying the costs yeah eight
