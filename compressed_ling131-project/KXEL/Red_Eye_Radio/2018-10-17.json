cannot be alone in a room with the female or the door has to be wide open a female student\nI'm not sure about the students I think the same rules apply can you imagine that you you've got to be so concerned about and this relates to what we've been talking about that someone will accuse you of something that you didn't do\nAnd and their teachers all the time and she was the things that they didn't do we call in Los Angeles the rubber room the good news is they get paid the same mouth so they sit around for months they sit around for years is the bad news you can't get rid of a bad teacher if they did do something bad\nBut if they didn't you can be kind of anything and everything and it happens all the time and where do you go as I said the other night where do you go to get your reputation back\n... this this whole politically correct movement is as Trump said he's not going to be politically correct to me it's thanks it's just is American a better place I don't think so

know some of the stuff that's gone on in the oval office that's why I mentioned President Reagan wouldn't walk in there without his suit and tie\nAnd I've learned I'm not always grant is that if I as much as you guys who were Democrats Kemp fan to Donald Trump or George Bush for that matter\nI felt the same way about Obama but I Know I've learned if you walked in the room you give credit to the

list of dozens of people that were so it's sort of uh the Clintons especially Hillary's and just mysteriously met the their demise\nThese buildings have character is a lot of stuff happening in our so you are right now that I'm being serious about it ah people met their unfortunate demise and these people would step over any but I heard the story I had him on my TV show I had a television show and

someone would be in the back seat and they'd say you know I'm going I really want that to be a commissioner in your in ministry and bill would say to him that will cost you fifty thousand dollars\nAnd he said to me more many weeks or months later someone else would ask them same commissioning so that'll be fifty thousand dollars\nThese guys were out of power and money it ... it was something that oh yeah uh\nYeah I like Clinton Foundation just to do I mean I just worked a catalyst millions in that part\nYou are you kidding me they did it because she's such a great speaker and Chelsea's agreed

back\n[laughter] as soon as\nI thought just you know how to like gay Philip thanks for the call appreciate it hurts\nYour mark new program\nThank you so much I buy oh here's someone's going to that I think is going to ask me right away in Las Vegas Jon with mark\n... yeah I think one I Would want to have coffee with is Titus now she ran for governor here in Las ... only two hundred vote to show [noise] and she was a schoolteacher in the central Norman and I I really do think that\nA nut Titus could prove with all the dirty tricks and terrible things that Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch parties ... to ... to\nElections death is over because I'm sure she kisses appalled there's a lot of those cars that is just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know [noise] so yeah I was going to have coffee was selling the Nina 'cause there's just no way in the world chicken approve of any of this okay\nIt is well except for one thing the I appreciate your call you didn't follow the rules and then came forward you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president and say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I\nThat's I think he's the head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye for right now you have your national forecasts or video roadblock\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible and the central part of the state with re precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains\nInto the southern Rockies under persistent clouds and precept Santa Ana winds here in Southern California over the next several days should gradually abate around the horn we've got New York city checking in with sunshine for later today and sixty the high\nUh quite frankly very few and far between I Would say that a Lindsey Lindsey Graham strikes me as a very profound man he's a\nHe's a really decent guy and he's he's got a heart and he's got he's got a mind and he's got a compassion for for the people that this country a he's a he's a Republican correct so\nYeah you know I I I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break the ice posed to a ... you know I mean look at Trump Trump is already wise you chose a tense\nAs the tea and it's it's great insurance ... behind you sew anything ever taught her bed goes dramatically launched cameras all you got it you've got a man who can step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you\nWell you you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge do for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a\nGreat night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right you can in these that Hammond, Indiana\n[noise] yeah I wanted to speak to the question of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't win much of the world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nOr I one of the reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't know I like\nAll remember a set aside the ... the possibilities of Democrats going for ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration a lot of people thought it'd be enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we are I don't think we want to get into a pattern or the incoming administration prosecute the leader of the leaders of the ... the former administration leaders of the other party because of our politics have become too hostile\nAs idiots we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical all to are are having a stable democracy we have and the rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because you know a lot of people and the other side I think he should be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of all having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what ... what what what they what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department there was a soft to trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she may have been Frederick\nIs jarred in the Justice Department though but I Will give you one further illustrates my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam committed treason 'cause obviously committed treason yet we do not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together\nGood a good point can I you know I said he may not have heard man said whoever talked me last night in quite said that get that's when I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point and that that's a great point when the civil war I presume you could you have coffee with on the other side or\n... or I Would probably lean toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh and he's a bright guy yeah he's he's things things that are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't stay with Tucker Carlson if you ever watch Fox News got these people answering questions in the news is kind of dumb but this is interesting because\nWho'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along with people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking and respecting that'll go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn\nYou're on with mark\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning\nI uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard like his show\nAnd has a dissertation on how I'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue in NYU should be able to get away with it [noise] um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kind of sign on to the previous caller just might be for me [noise] um if she really had broken the law and then found guilty then certainly she should be locked up [noise] um\nBut right just go\nAnd that sounded like a polluted twisted demonic land\nAnd when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country had had bars on the shores of this country to keep its mass\nThat the Native Americans in this country that had bars on the shores of this country to keep his nasty lazy hateful ancestors out of this country\nAnd I would like to have coffee I waited on on the other side I'm even though\nI disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski because that woman she says she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side uh\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and character and strength and she's about asked\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little scrape with Trump and um she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so uh she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell\nI haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside a here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lot of people were liking ah his name as Conor Lamb and I really like for you know like for\nMore people like him to rise\nAnd I don't want to see Joe Biden Lonegan um I think that he's had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh\nI I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but um you know some of these people just need to step out of the way\nAnd uh let a new crop of progress that's come through\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line Sonny ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for that she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article but I don't know ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't church committee or just ... it is not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know I mean I'd love to be accomplishment of viewpoints me tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but um compared to the other physicians there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to\nLet me know what your thinks or asking to questions who's your choice to run against a President Trump\nAnd who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys a surprise me it just the volume that question but you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side that you admired least could sit down and talk with so let me know what
