was out there I just I hadn't mentioned this Fox News had a great article\nA liberty written by liberty a bitter the mega millions jackpot and while you're not being told the truth not being told the truth [laughter] yes ah\nIn an effort to create jak pots like this one lottery officials have not only made it harder to win\nBut have continued to lie to us about the benefits of the lottery ... about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense though because I often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ... and I stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of which were Christmas Party and it was apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because I ... that's not\nTo use the cliche the lotteries never even on my radar it really is right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar at all mhm\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in a real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line ... twenty five people there and I just did it in the ... no no no you you appear why am I going to cut goes no no no you're buying alcohol\nNobody in line for alcohol the liquor store everybody is in line for the lottery tickets yeah never forget that once I started thinking well at least with alcohol you already know you're a loser well the way you know I might as well [laughter] well it's not going to happen in the second half on the bench leading the pot stores\nLike twelve lanes of traffic five o'clock in the afternoon I look over on the median close to a line of trees a huge coyote it looked more like a wolf because it was filled out it was it

it's it's all spread out yeah and you know in this neighborhood here there's wild animals all the time and I'm a cook I already don't you think it's a cat\nBut [laughter] we didn't value but it's more

[laughter] I'm pretty sure he was hanging out [laughter] yeah it was like okay this is sixteen pounds yeah are coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the\nMid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John bathe her because that story\nOf the whole pot thing has has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco\nAnd the Turkish president says can show geese killing was premeditated and we'll take up the owners of a bakery who will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of uh you yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs slug you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last ... and the fact that when I were going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean uh they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them if it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence votes\nAnd this is they could lose their lively and you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you think about it a farmer them hit them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a\nFarming ah and ... in the mid west there are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the editor of yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nInternet and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with a formula as to who's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democrats' side as we spend a lot of time on it and also the Republican side sure what it could hurt the Democrats and what could hurt the Republicans because there are things out there that could hurt the Republicans in the selection that more coming up plus your calls and comments eight six six Ninety

single day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles dating well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just yeah I mean everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the posters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety four where they weren't even quote\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nMoisture tied to hurricane Wilma in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those reins into western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding in severe weather in place for the region\nAnother whether maker will be a surface alone near the southern tip of Texas so a couple of systems moving in rain and thunderstorms certainly possible along the Gulf Coast today with marginal risks of flash flooding in effect and below normal temperatures will continue for the southern plains Fifteen to twenty five degrees below average\nFrom where I live to just uh you know several miles north and the tax rate\nVaries greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yet that influences the Bible at my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it\nUm but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... your taxes are higher\nAnd and and with a lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that age\nUh aren't the we're not talking the super rich were I learned about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and\nWhat's their only recourse right now they're still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message by Republican congressman ...\nAnd we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to bend paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which\nAnd even though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nJust the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that made by ... that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes you know\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going and we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually in many where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt\nThat we've also talked about the care of it but in ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday\nAuto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears along expected decline is here now the economy\nOverall may not ... and and and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse at the the ... caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are telling us but the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nBut it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said when the president came out and said there I\nDelivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a\nGood thing\nOr there's a story last week about Ford grumbling gonna be allusion a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business of deals with board and the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or or feeling it already and every dealership and every member of the steel tariffs really been affects that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old them because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got to June of this year so you\nLook at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in a price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cost and\nBecause of the new NAFTA ah and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk or if you're talking about a manufacturing\nPeople would manufacturing jobs that have technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump country when you're talking about farmers that are extremely upset because it's not only their current profits but it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it disappeared you\nMade the comment you said a in our present meeting you said I Wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now as\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt and it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa\nIt's that you were trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry the farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nUh and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada or any nation that they're selling to most farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war terrifying that went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away\nThat's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our law says All right and we're ... we're we're ... or out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in front of a decade I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty is a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government\nOr during the recession or in two thousand eight to ... end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine they there were free apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well limit made all the banks look risky\nAnd that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you can rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty anywhere in that then your former customers are going to stick with someone else to another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in mid term election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party but the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because\nIt's an day opposition political party that the Democrats are and a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts the starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting the selection both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nWar started from operation you have to even get savings in

I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know\nThat but I abused as examples these are all women that are in executive positions either own their companies are in management up or you know a high management in the company is up there in our own their own companies\nAre or are in sales and I started talking about them during the whole me to a thing about you know how they how they felt about it and I use them as examples of women that I Know that how they looked at the whole cabinet situation\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base mhm in his rhetoric mhm\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think that those bases as his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing but your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere they're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him that it's so it's those\nPeople who are okay there's some good things some bad things where am I going where you know what am I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought I bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again in both probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I guess you know I'm not sure but probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse based was the limit it was because\nYou had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk win and then you made it less civil went right why why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base right\nAnd so there you go but a waste of your calls in comments coming up your life you know we do have a line open eight six six Ninety read I\nPitched from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service dispatcher serve as a sort of air traffic controller for the company's fleet\nEnsuring drivers get where they need to safely and as soon as possible there often juggling duties between multiple trucks and drivers so patients from both the driver and the dispatcher is essential for us to the operation when times get challenging like when there's bad\nWeather or a driver gets a bad route the relationship between dispatcher and driver inexperienced wealth moments negatively affecting all parties and removing the customer from the equation as a priority to build driver and dispatcher maintaining a good working relationship with your dispatcher\nAnd communicating with him or her regularly especially when there are problems helps keep all parties focused on what's most important keeping customers happy and drivers safe this temple is brought to you by changing Keller and associates incorporated visit us on Jay Jay Keller dot com\nThis has been the merit George driver report brought to you by pilot flying J shell world satellite and merits or after market run with the bowl [noise]\nWhat book he wrote a review a record ...

I mean we've seen that he's a liar\nUm he's a he's ... and and by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that or he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work because it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody name\nYour call every Nettie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've got something\nThat if you go you go there you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the ... or ... you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I like people say well what do you mean that's when that's a positive uh what came out ... of the news story that\nYou get you get the help from the left to get the capital of thing and you get the care of and thing you get all these other things that you know and and of course ah you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know Camilla Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or work or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working\nAnd you can point out where there's aren't going to work and that's something that is extremely rare in politics even with ah other effective presidents in the past\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy\nYou know and and that's it and and and find a way I Do want to um\nClarify you know we've criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada on yesterday show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your right of\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally what is a rally\nRally is a a ton of positives and the map this massive group of euphoric people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives\nCan go after Chuck Schumer anybody\nElse because I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising when that's ridiculous I of course you have to point out on nothing that you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your ah you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the ... that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller ab all solved cry on our side right well it's not that that that it then that's why I started ... I started laughing because\nYou know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to give blood is we've gotten blonde and passionate about it during the Kavanaugh herring said it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt and you're not an American\nBut if you if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were both Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not a quarter or it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify and and so uh I'm a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes\nAmericans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact that they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of caring about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet Harry's we don't care we point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody they're not paid for it because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you were jak the basic tenants of the constitution if you were jak free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you were jacked\nThe second amendment if you were checked\nA due process under the law if you weren't checked the electoral college if you were checked it\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say it right it's it's not and people's what's shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it bomb you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech or no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nRight that free speech oh\nNo no no see your free speech as bigoted and your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter]\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe when the move onto the next when well again I was going\nTo win for calling out a a war or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting and saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do and such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy\nAnd look what they want to do with it and back to and and the other\nEnd by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname and calling is very effective [laughter] liar\nLanny I now I made that one up I don't know\nHow to taking these are the ones I I don't want against Schumer ... was uh what was it\nI don't know when you when when you start when they said sure I forgot what it was just ... yeah and I thought to use somebody's got those listed somewhere okay like names\n... no ... we said the so well now it's poodle people in office hits running it's beautiful ... is not lying that any more [laughter] and as far as we know that\nIt's brutal people in office it's running it's beautiful ... is that line chat anymore [laughter]\nUh\nAnd as far as we know the president noted blogger believes that Mr Cruz's father had involved in the ...\nAs far as we know about but but look I'm we said before I thought one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but had a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat\nAnd an end the name of of of policy on one when I was I didn't know you were on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's

they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nIt because it's ... it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not from us\nThat's

because they\nThey did this series on a on a table I Know ... stories of people winning the lottery and just ended horribly I'm an someone did the story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nOr you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell even your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt that when you claim the prize\nThe word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nThen people come at you believing you didn't earn it so he feels mine for them\nAnd you know because if if I'm sure it became crazy with relatives you didn't know you had and the whole thing um\nAnd and that's the real you know that's the real risk of it because that's like we said the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing and they were trying to win the money\nAnd their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there relative a wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know\nAnd sometimes it's not not even people view you know some of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but nonprofits non stop knocking at

would've been much more exciting and when I was younger me winning the lottery in these days would be like what a hassle\n[laughter] well I mean it would take a lot of thought about it wouldn't change my life too much I thought about that kind of money because after taxes\nUh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent you know of the overall price a one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five\nHundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars that's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already you went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nYou know the story always go to one of the least rich guys and the Senate mom and and you woke up richer than a middle and end the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and parking anywhere you know what I mean I mean where are you\nGoing to take that I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the back\nIt would it would be a bit disturbed there's there's nothing I'm\nI'm not finding I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] ... it would it would be a huge hassle and uh I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm I and\nI don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life\nI have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your\nLife I have a a friend who a friend or family member who are ... at one time was working for a a multibillion it\nUm and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way only because there's not enough\nTime of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and now my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener things we are um but\nTo their own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener thinks we are um but but\nThe point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes\nAh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to to know I couldn't have lost\nAnyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people that what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name\nPrivate so this ... it would be it would be hard demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nHe exactly the the more your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs are gone well I don't want to run\nMy in laws there are laws about raising the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\n... my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job triggering out what to do even if you're not going to give it away that's what I mean you are going to be a full time job is going to be huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone my life is life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's say let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older like my like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm Oh yes I Am you know what I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I was one dumped off it goes through a mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I'm On one point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other job allow we that we've ever done you know really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up until today\nA little shocking we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know yes or you I mean we really ... it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse and we just have the end of the show we grab our lunch pail isn't going to let them do it that's what the feeling is his like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist [laughter] and so the mentality sort of the same so I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business\nAnd personal life well you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my ... because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about that said basically keep death the thinking of death at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going to get all this money death [laughter]\nI was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it\nAh I I I don't know I'll have to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his
