watching the Christian work this afternoon and what other correspond to us talking about ... toward what the FBI to have her therapy notes throated out that in twelve and\nNo no no no she didn't know she did she telling you well she did and I mean that's all that's all she did not want back she was holding back the notes from that there is from the FBI\nNo no she was holding them back to the Senate not from\nThe ... are from the Senate yes it's the same thing there's no difference\nNo no down there is a big difference in other as it is but it's part of the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWhat no you can give it to the Democrats that you give it to the Democrats and they and they present it and the people get to see it\nThe FBI or what you forget about is the FBI not investigating anything not agreeing with them every once in a criminal matter it was a background check the impact what the FBI would deal with it would be put it into the three oh two white which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI and there's been tire equation I just to give the Senate the information you're making the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway that's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario\nIs to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be ... putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd uh it's a Feinstein of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to them so they didn't do do that way no so it's a useless conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that would if\nFord's if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that a and forge assuming Ford's lawyers are telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two after because of the background check the

clear today with the exception of far western Texas there is a moderate to risk of excessive rainfall however from eastern Iowa\nInto far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will have claimed ooh that's a challenge is not\nRight I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting here 'cause that was the key of\nLook at the last sentence with recently a combination please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein in her role into\nOther than a year communications with me and my staff member of my staff in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford leaving them Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and\nA WBUR mirrors Julie sweat neck or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday\nSo it was I guess that the last call her ... she was willing to turn them over to the FBI\nOur and our point was when I when I said no it's like because our point does it go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see it the the\nBest ... they wouldn't be in that they simply\nTake it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only my senators were said the only the centers would see it and their goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence ... and she wants to the people who say she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to Grassley in wrestling outside of the three oh two\nBecause then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak\nExactly\nOr\nLightened legally for just released the entire ride to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n\n'cause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay but I ... the Washington Post and the wall street\nJournal [noise] no I mean from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not only there were some Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... uh let me see that ah when was that sent here in front of you were okay\n'cause that letter must have been late last night the Shannon Bream a pulse of the ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the um uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure as interesting\nAmong please let us know your please give to us you know what you've shared with five time in her own oh whoa ... yeah because of uncovered evidence so what do they have right what what is what is that what is that one about so again I'm\nWe're getting into stupid area again we're getting into areas you know with the lawyers state and they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\nYeah\nYeah and I ate a demand that doesn't even a demand that within a demand that would ensure if you went through it that way that the no ... would never become public right you would never know what was the ... site\nThey would not\nBecause of the Senate rule see the light of day if you want this public there's plenty of ways to do that\nOr eight six six Ninety right and

would've been quietly handle and investigate it thoroughly\nIt would maintain the anonymity of laws they forward it would've respected Kavanaugh's reputation and they would have gotten to the bottom but they can either capital or what if they start to bomb a nation or and played it was a four would have been proved to be right\nOr not but I N Feinstein obstructed justice here and pull this last minute and she should be ... you know we're at a town a rail for obstructing\nJustice I mean it's a criminal act\nWell if you look at it as whom who betrayed the trust of of Dr Ford\nAnd find it was

I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work\nWhile your daughters and a wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nEither of those events the vote\nIf right now the Republican Party\nWith all due respect to the cartels [laughter] um the the whole idea though is that you've got to broaden it beyond the El Paso district right I mean he can win the Paso district as long as he wants to run for that house seat\nUm and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you know so um yeah uh that's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of taxes now certainly he's done better than um\nA lot of the people who jumped into different races\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott\nUm that's you know again he's he's very well then the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle well\nThen and that's bad or walk just trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get them or he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas and hope to get elected\nAnd that's the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we gotta move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were reading basically this is who we are I guess my point is that when you think about\nTen years ago right now\nWhen you think of ten years ago mhm when Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held I Would have been no what about the convention\nWhere your conviction ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked\nLike he was a you know the the the entire\nStage it was set up with these ... and everything else where he looked like some Greek forum yes yes ... and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God blight yeah he's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like heath hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading socialist candidate in the country mhm I\nRide on Obamacare and we don't I don't need all bio and I don't know we don't need a bomb gas\nSo they don't have the Hollywood they come out that that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that a deadly in inside the state it doesn't\nWork but a work has no problem taking money from outside the said from the liberals who have been pouring money into the state but well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz and an effort to be Ted Cruz\nUm you know so you know he wants the liberal basically the liberals to you guys stay outside of Texas look we've got our liberal places in in Texas by there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here the the point is though to the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got ... Obama ... but the fact is he knew he could reject Obama publicly at\nThe ... I didn't ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to know anymore\nOh no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and ...\nI mean is it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top of the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base right\nThey don't care right we don't uh well because Obama yesterday's news well listen\nI mean I'm a lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was the here over the moment the point is is not that Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left and by the way that the euro is going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the presser dance the person standing next to you will have a new reason to victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's\nHere's my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my got that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a ... bed or work here in the state of Texas so I\nLook at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there any like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to light to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his inauguration till the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay also eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not ... as a president like Kim cause you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... also predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or Pelosi's getting old and you know they're just Schumer is to New York and so when still be Obama that wouldn't be the leader for a while of the Democratic party he's not seen any more\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful\nAnd one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook\nSo I'm watching the thing I remember the most is them saying\nWhat does Obama done for us to remember this was the beginning or yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nCracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling because you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American\nWhat does Obama done for us what does Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no rational right and it and it it always will be that's why the party has no direct\nEvidence that that's what you get with identity politics yeah because there is no there are still there and there were there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goal this is probably the closest thing to get to a political goal which is to defeat cabinet ... yes\nIf the activists are are are going in multiple directions above and then the party is led by them they're going to try and it was every direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now you're nights the Democrats right eight six six Ninety road I\nWas really much of a record or radio [noise]\nListen to read I radio show

new rule\nThat what you learn in a background check stays private\nYes it is going to be known only to the senators and and the idea is that ah I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation I hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so\nIf you\nAbout how a background check has done for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nTerry so if you talk about how a background checks on for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the military by and and maybe you have a I so I Know someone who's who who had both parents were immigrants\nAnd so there was a that there was a a a

we\nCan all agree on that [laughter] but [laughter]\nAnd he didn't use real shock but the the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim the reason the FBI as part of it is because they have

for ice cream [laughter]\nIt in other news this from the hill dot com this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and uh yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign mhm\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from ... the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nThat suffer amused by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele compiled the ...\nOf uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the left it's always uncooperative [laughter] cooperating law intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed it up by testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground above the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use\nOf the body while you're to record Trump the interview was one of the most productive we've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said another said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI\nAbout FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking his because what you have there you have you have the first person\nFrom the last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason if you were investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured mourn right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion\nWhy why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days other news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices there's some Bloomberg now\nOh pets largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set in November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies\nA million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty six team before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nUh the key insight this is from blue bird their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from\nTrump now we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we know we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat Saudi we'd be there every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors in a ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you producer on oil here and we become a record producer of oil\nThat's money that stage here well and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you have the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThan I'd give I'd give credit here to President Trump is where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding your military where we're there for you all the time mhm ah and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia the OPEC member light bill pact member [laughter]\nVery good deal back that feel that member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um but ... wild starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original chair of the ... [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ...\nOr ... who is leading the columnist for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA\nMexico's only significant concession was on automobiles in parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower priced models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff and will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from studying at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments are they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right and\nAs we said all along are we there's been a lot of us you know industry that has suffered because of this and you wouldn't have if you end up basically but the same deal for things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances does that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses becomes severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to ... dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nLearn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to ... dot org ... band together for a better tomorrow\n[noise]\nUsed ...

at Obama and his effect on the left it doesn't hurt at all that'll\nRourke turns him down what is that tells you about Obama and his influence on the left\nAnd the fact that it doesn't matter using

like yeah listen\nUh you know we're trying to just do this on our own uh you know you know maybe the the voters won't react positively to Bill Clinton being you know as the ... an endorsement on on the ticket now you can just open we say yeah\nWe're ... we're over Obama\nWe don't need\nI mean really it is the major major he's yesterday's news desk ... it's the major blue states\nWhere he gets applauded but the question is does he really happening usefulness to the party itself if you think about the the like when he um gave us a list of in endorsements remember who is back and when that came out mhm\n[noise] kind of like his bracket used to be [laughter] but it really kind of have the same political impact as actually I could say this is rock it used to get more news\n\nRight well ideas piano did well no I Know coach ... well yeah that I bought those aren't dinosaur different suggests it was yeah yeah you know out of you let's not get political by bringing ESPN and right and I I mean again it got huge news no he\nWas and and the endorsement list really I mean it came out and made his rounds but it really didn't go any further from that there hasn't been that presence\nYou know by Obama and that might be his choice I mean they've been saying what they hanging out I did see the stories here's what he's reading this summer nobody cares\nNo one cares I remember that story no one could here's what's on his reading list for shows them you know on a on a couch you know somewhere probably in Martha's Vineyard no body cares but\nIt hasn't been the political impact\nAnd in that part is I mean for the rights gets kind of been that way for a while George W.
