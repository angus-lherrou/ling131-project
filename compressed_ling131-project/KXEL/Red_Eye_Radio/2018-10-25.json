I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already\nIn the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years\nCan't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not memorize early now we're talking about getting a message across the\nYeah more seats instead of losing seats and this was back then not an either early now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced we've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you are not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now are they're capable together of getting real things done than they need to get our message out there but\nThere is this and and we continue to to fight this all the time or we will get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody that we don't know\nWhy would that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people evolve every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population but people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest\nThings some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started all you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change her mind though you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of\nAlways growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it and we believe if you promote free markets conservative economics conservative principles and you will explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to show you have sawdust out you sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably by while I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there and that is the goal the goal is to win\nThat the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate eat news a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people write us you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou kidding me in terms of if you\nLiked or just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah it's really an\nCalm [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time entertainment oh it's like sitting on a beach\nSo like that just sitting there and I'm ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their version island saint Thomas beats a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no that's not our goal\nLook after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric is it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean ... doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates me\nIs understanding that the left uses the heated heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation ... they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\n\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated\nAs hell mhm we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need to that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there

okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay can you can you\nCan I ask her benefit I and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's

we talked about how we don't like pit political ideology on either side nut I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for

go to John in Minnesota John welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nThanks for taking my call say um I just like to take exception to cheer premise of belief that President Trump's going to have any long term effect accomplish 'cause you know I mean it can be over to X number one you know he's got three branches or the ... all three branches of\nGovernment um first by presidents come and do\nA a okay if it'll tell you what the workers were short on time John I'll tell you what would be reversed will have a two year construction is on the Supreme Court good point yeah\nExcellent point yeah Adam Sandler I that's why I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim that we stayed at\nWhat they did about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the all the answers\nAnd I'll make is John John John John saw it on we said that the president and the Republicans are making progress than they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah I made about long lasting or anything else like when you say anybody in front of course I could I could get you on that because I pointed out uh with you know capital and Gorsuch you have to construct your right on the\nSaturday or knowledge of\nThat right and you know we want we we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch should we look at Obama most about Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you use executive orders from uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well\nIn in ... here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're going to we're going to take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember I almost right away well we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent well I I I I had heard was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last of ministry she tried that they've tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges and the business\nBecause the problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they don't sweat it was an oversight fear in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the ... was Washington\nPost on there headline had it right there headline had it that the powder that was sent along with all the time you know a along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that and\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible more as a time but I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us at ... they're saying that the bomb was harmless but this is in our pre show me not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off and\nUh and you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off for where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it than the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm war they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask the right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when\nWe talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the device of this must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't add the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the little person\nOr persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against divisiveness and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know the trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are ... person or group of people based on them which area which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised that the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n\nYeah if you look at the nature of or how this was said ah the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr a you know the multiple stamps that went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that assorted and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service or actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time\nAnd place but but the point being is that they have a great\nDeal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know they may be where the facility or facilities were that these were sent from what I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now whether these rely bombs or not they know right they haven't said\nNo we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go on and could have been triggered by and that was a phone or whatever I\nThat would be the next question why not write well because in in\nIt and I know is is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy and I'm saying there is there an investigative reason why you wouldn't do it\nWell and if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\n\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the ...\nBut those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building to CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time but but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that's the if the threat is real ... that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we were seeing the pictures on on ah online and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at that looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that
