something that the ah [noise]\nI won't see the left for gifts about both the left doesn't care about\nYou know uh you don't get any points out that that by the way Senator Lindsey Graham a on Sunday Morning but you don't get any points from the west not that Lindsey Graham was trying to get points from about by supporting ... and Kagan\nUh but you see that situation and they what they forget is the process\nAnd what they forget is how many people on Capitol Hill or at least bid on Capitol Hill respect the process at one time okay just little nit picking mhm I Know\nWas it was a good battle to win it's not the war but it was a good ... right uh I just hope for the next Supreme Court justice and and I just hope they started laying the base now that the Republican Party stopped calling the judges conservative judges mhm\nYou and I've gone through this before we talk about how we even have got caught saying it just because you know it it's a ... but they're not conservative judges there's a complete and total difference between what conservatives wanted a Supreme Court justice and what liberals want\nMhm uh we want to Supreme Court justice citizen originalist or a ... you know ... or construction is somebody will look at the text of the of of the constitution whatever it is and say it says this and I'm not going to read into it\nIrrespective of whether it hurts my day to day politics\nA Supreme Court justice putting them into office was not about my day to day politics it's about upholding the constitution of the United states it is about the legislature short making laws and not an unelected the judge\nTo the left is about an unelected judge\nMaking law making legislation mhm we go back to\n... so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and what it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in an argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in the old fulfilled their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them\nThey're all over the place on their opinions\nYes\nTheir opinions don't have their opinions on their goal post move all over the place\nRight so to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\n\nAnd we'll slander and pain somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was ... he was New Bern in my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent Bob for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can never vote for democratic get ever ever when I'm being told what white males thanks as always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year was getting rid of the electoral college by the left we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now all of them [laughter] than BC reporter who said you know basically it's time to get rid of the Senate\nSo if you ever to the electoral college

Gary ... eight six six\nNinety or red eye Eric I'm sure you agree with me on this we haven't even had the discussion on this but I think one of the things that the Republicans learned who might have forgotten about it is\nA the anger isn't just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump from the left the anger has always been there the range has always been that well excuse me\nBeen there for the last couple of decades right now I Will say but it has been the last couple of decades it was there a Bush like I said we forget we have short memories Bill Maher was one who said well yeah you know we we said Bush was Hitler we said Rami was Hitler but they really weren't but this guy really is\nNo as we found out it doesn't matter who you are if\nYou are on the other side they will come after us they will defame knew their range will be amplified and will continue to be amplified to the point where you're like I really can't believe when you when you look at it when you saw some of these protesters you say I really can't believe\nThat you know these these people have\nA critical thinking thoughts that actually goes through their head\nWell keep in mind I mean you know for a at least five days or so Jeff Flake was the hero remember when Coons called him a hero he was a hero in all this when he delayed the process a that was until the vote\nYour hero until the book but it and it doesn't matter who you are even if you're on the left they don't you're not useful to them anymore ... does not need to Brock Obama campaign ... so it doesn't matter who you are you're not immune for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nWill see the bulk of the showers today extended from northern Texas along I thirty five in through Oklahoma Kansas and portions of Iowa and two Ninety four country where some of that rain could turn over to snow\nAs you get near the Canadian border primarily dry in the northeast the mid Atlantic and much of the south today Gulf Coast states have a chance of brain California will be dry we've got spotty showers\nFor the Pacific northwest and chances are with this persistent weather pattern in place that will be your weather for tomorrow as well if you're traveling this holiday you may notice a lot less traffic on the roadways\nYou know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about impeachment\nNot gonna happen\nIt's not going to happen because you're not going to move on it when when you know you want to do well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect tours no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss\nOf luck doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts in anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that ... that the process is that they flap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet or confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you will\nIt doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet or confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and\nThey'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work and some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound will do\nSo you don't have all the details ... they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the Weiner's and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to stay in children of\nA preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAh and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done they are there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean the the ... if you if you can point to go to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but it was a ... a came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers\nYou're twenty people we want to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses\nTo this actual event right she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them but can cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd what those no she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman asked asked for them right because the the story came out\nThat she uh and her lawyer prove or lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know I knew there and they were having to come\nTo you had plenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee out where they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has on the no\nThe only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you never believe the uh the the man you had white males on the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI and a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of a you're a little bit mistaken it got down to the point for all they had was an allegation and they believe that allegation should be enough\nMhm rarely if we were first roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or doesn't matter the whether he's guilty or innocent such as a matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that's yeah so then you get what you want just have multiple unverified allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just say this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat if a woman says it in this case it must be bullied not another cases but just this particular case it must be believed now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the women that said well why aren't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being sold the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist uh up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nAh everything that they sure why does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test mhm\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence when the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that all her witnesses said they couldn't cooperate at well the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers uh the the process was even distorted to that extent so\nSo from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers or the the process was even distorted to that extent so to in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to ... well it was voted along party lines\nWhat what what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that Trump as president it doesn't matter that its capital as the nominee is where we are as a nation politically

same representation in the Senate has to change senators representing less than half of the U.S we're about to come from a nominee opposed by most Americans\nOh I don't know if that's true because I saw the poll but was across America that showed a that uh if the FBI did the investigation that sixty percent of Americans are in favor so I'm right well\nAnd I guess they're doing it on the population of the states represented the yes well OK okay I'm being those fifty senators in this case so then the senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states\nRight necessarily oh well that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with freedom of speech few years back when the ...

as far as to gather all year as go ... and the confirmation\nIt it wouldn't allow that who was elected president on the Republican side there would have done this to anyone would have been crews ... whoever Yo Yo's chairs Trump fights back\nHere it's like a lion and and and and and he just makes me very proud to be an American were actually very proud to say that I voted bad\nI'm a I Would say this Bryan that I I'm not sure and we ... we will never know but I'm not sure how another Republican would have reacted\nTo the heat on Kavanaugh if they might have withdrawn his nomination and I think that's something to consider is that is it that Trump or wouldn't back down and and he refused to withdraw that nomination that's a possibility I don't know how to quantify that because we'll never know but it's I think we have to consider that possibility\nWell thank you protect\nYour wind them when I was you had a few day or you take your and but he brings up a point that we've made along we met last week made of the week before ... ... you know well this is what you get when you get Trump now this would have happened no matter what\nIs this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the left behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past Republicans other Republicans might have been\nApparently not Lindsey Graham must [laughter] but other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the past have been quick to eat their own I don't I don't know I Can't say that about a\n... because we don't we'll never know if Ted Cruz at one or is he mentioned a Rubio or anybody else and other Republican were there or Mike Pence I have no idea uh we don't know if if they would have withdrawn the nomination\nUm when the ... this president basically said okay fine we'll do another FBI background check 'em you know giving it the entire a vetting process of seven complete background checks\nSo I I don't know I but I Do know that this president has been less willing to back down\nI'm as unpredictable as he may be at times\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes known as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way we guard was of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one\nNot too but a total of four they're really really voting for Ted Cruz and so our time for time I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but\nOthers may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision a you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm Still from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together and most dead on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to ... um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know I just wanted to make them more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that do Democrats are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term well done and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you might look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his peck yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending truck right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nUh to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for ... ... ... ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech and like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass\nAnd the big pass which she shouldn't have done because I Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leave anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick\nOf Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party ... before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican the Republican Party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is just met he'd when you come when it comes to spending culturally\nUh probably a more right than they'd been in a while I'm more constitutional and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had such unity part of it is the fight uh from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions are on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections as he still goes after them as did others early on\nMade you think OK doesn't really know who is picking this really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know well what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham\nHas still be on the Sunday Morning new shows saying he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah\nYou you know and that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I think we are light years right now as to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again what we said the base uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even ...\nThey are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world\nAnd even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good wailing away with the ... the Democratic senators won't before that I Know that's it's not going to have you know it's not only that but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because if they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which gamble never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that tower that castle\nIf you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence ... due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... ... moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they're able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty against eight or ...\nOr a book or right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that feed that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have

I think it is about the fact that you have the as I've said why'd\nI was single Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter than happened democratic about a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is uh right now and\nThis and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that

the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through\nA on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other band and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nUh the life was going to you know they used to them when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left one do you use that\nAnd and and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the bipartisan willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was\nBut of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and you were outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and marine Frank ... come to New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about there it's it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has a different since with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking from side with Trump's candidate I mean I I mean he\nDoesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't a ... he doesn't get that and I don't\nKnow I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham\nBut Lindsey Graham ah when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the and and on the larger by a much to a larger than a pretty much the treatment of capital by\nThe Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look the Democrats on the committee\nFrank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said\nAs we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have any one I have not seen any rational thought more critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which wouldn't be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all except\nFor rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case\nWith this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations of came forward every single point that we had made which are the\nYeah ... came forward every single point that we have made\nWhich\nAre the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest going to drive the nuts and moral and correct and right and you're wrong and reading Frank Bruni column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalked about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lined\nUp\nYeah I mean it is again a the ... they\nJust lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate Canada debate so they ... through what he what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what well they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this older right over there that's a good nominate that's a that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nOh I can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and John might in the future you're running for attorney general right [laughter] I Wonder have you been in general what are you trying to get out of that ... exactly exactly well that's it\nHe's only doing this well again that's because you can't debate the points that he made the only point you have it he was against Trump and now he's for Trump we've we've said with the simple ten\nYou know are arguments that will never and I called them simple to an arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't [noise]\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\nAnd you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become attorney general yeah you know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's a green with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they\n... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the side that had the greater intellect [laughter] that'll tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... the they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nBand and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump and now he likes drop\nDebate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight six six Ninety red eye

to possibly\nA super slander stunk report or other nutty whatever his name is uh\nUh I think that men do some I think I think that it may slow them down a little bit in the effort because I agree with you guys are going to continue to describe it um but I think that if judge were loose super slander or libel oh\nHe's a private citizen Depp because he's not the same rules of a capping off them for anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who has who they brought in\nSlow them down I think that we give them food for food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further um maybe there's something there may be there the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would\nHave a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but I'm a would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA prove this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the link to the media and all that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it so if that if\nThat law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it\nBecause what responsibility do they have in a case brought by ... by march judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked it to the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his name out there\nAnd that you could see I think part of that and they have in any case that was that was him yes yeah and then he gave him and that because they ... they get the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right the only possibility of backlash on the news and you wouldn't want to put your buddy ... they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got temper problems and I wouldn't want them to think that they're good at issue in this in spite of the news but it was for Spiderman\nYeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every predictable and even some uh unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it then and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as a cap Kavanaugh did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge\nOr that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden but you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that is that survived at all was Dr forge claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I Am and and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so yeah he wasn't trying to link\nIt to the ... a a media but in the ad in any case yeah to me that would even be eight and and again\nDon't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just on the doctor I where I'm just using right that that is a possible exception\nTo me that would even be eight and and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just on the doctor or I'm just using right that that as a possible exception here right up but with the other case\nTo me that's clear I mean going going after cab at all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm biking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right eye and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nBecause then you've got to make your case it's the worst probable cause while I think it might have happened\nThat's not good enough no no absolutely not so I'd like to just to ebony personally\nWell I mean well because\nLet's go to Gary in sparks Nevada Gary urine rather Radio Welcome to the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you could argue that it is um\nThe Republicans they came for complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or a guy in science and and so on it's like yelling or a bank robber by complaining about it when\nYou're dealt with all the work I don't want to handle it whoa whoa\nWhere's the perjury Heidi approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... and if you don't want to take that one and how hard Dianne Feinstein\nWell OK well one of those ... ... well my point is we go point by point by\nWhat you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you\nCharge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy a chauffeur\nWhile I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation there and I so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have that in their promise on ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell now one ... that was the Republicans' fault no\nI ... that was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese now with I don't know what they get them but what did this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss\nIt is but because the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with ah with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted we said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November\nOf twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not always that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada responding to when we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following\nDefamation of character lawsuit and well when you when you go after a private\nCitizen you have to at least had some type of evidence that this happened a he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not\nGo to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness\nStating she's lying about it but uh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm I'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has\nAnd about it but uh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah ah any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperate and so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nYes and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't ah when the seats that they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president and the first midterm afterwards but almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed mhm ah Andy United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans ...\nKnow if you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty wouldn't want her charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and so the best we can do is get out the truth than we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure why we laugh when it said she said you know that that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins and gives me you're on the ... and ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nThe United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody would agreement that's what she did and it would still be half of Americans said so what you should be able to get away with that and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn anything is that the truth is told that I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now and the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh those so we're going to give it to Michael ... we went that doesn't make ... Michael ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from Michael have\nA dog to my ... like they don't have the [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went to ... because it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general of the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story has been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd so we don't know what's gonna happen there but get is a true and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing\nThat's on that yet and that's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe've said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as it is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this ... this will play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nSix six months later on [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered and joined the million mile club on line I read I radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThe tough that's about ... lead is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to read I radio for up to date to information and be sure to follow red eye radio and tough tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "08"}
