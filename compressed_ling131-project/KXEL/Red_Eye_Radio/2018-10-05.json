updates when it comes to your area but it will be available shortly online both Amazon and I\nDo still get to have a Facebook page\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting I'm a year or two but when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some ... uh which we we have no reason to\nTo believe her to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is Robert ... who's this a PHD used on always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing an\nElection uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nThey actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson a we highlight and the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his concept so\nIt does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide at their whim\nOr how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well I mean that they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that that example you just gave our our particularly know where the man is sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the oil being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film is during the twenty sixteen election or they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was or five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers or in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know\nThings seem to be pretty balanced but Google and every single search position of the top ten search results\nThis results favored\nHillary Clinton said what they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate that this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that ran undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at\nThe one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo ... when we come back in just a moment\n[noise] visual home of a un I Panthers is we get to the Waterloo Cedar Rapids\nThe pope comes to Iowa more from the Iowa omen act in a moment\nAll the sort of dystopian knowledge or a novel about a totalitarian us and it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state\nWas going to smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of bumpy information to us but it was simple it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face and what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nBut what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the test\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm Mao or stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us\nYes last us George Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois Linda\nHow low can I Am I going to make a quick comment a lot of it they believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but when I really called us asking that want to thank our guests for what he's doing\nAnd about search engines and they're used to be I click which had a\nThey they have another one called start page the same company that they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted to resolve and I don't understand that Google press did they make them suppressing X clinic or what happened to it and I is that that though\nI Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has the search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that it's an apple products\nAnd Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing the research is but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because they want the information and the data that comes through search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing\nEverywhere and you're exactly right star page a is a a search engine you get great results\nThey actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being president I think that is that is going to change of ... biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nCan either ... or manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that bang\nWhich is the Microsoft product which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century twenty six teams truck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement\nWe don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google and a lot of people believe that there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in the moment\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if

give it to the Democrats and then they ... and they present it and the people get to see the FBI were you what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground when it wasn't a criminal\nMatter it was a background check the impact what the FBI would deal with it would be put into the three oh two white which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have that's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI and his entire equation by just to give the Senate the information you're making\nIt sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway\nThat's in fact the only purpose the FBI served in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\n\nIf I mean she would officially be

interesting to know that that's what that is what has come out in the summary well\nWhat's interesting here is that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday on the program and and we were we were wondering\nIn this process because of the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details and those three oh two reports a secret and can be viewed only by a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall to tell us essentially gay or nay if there is something new there or something more to this investigation in other words something to substantiate the claims by Dr Ford and ...\nAnd that summary of you if you look at it by the the Judiciary Committee is basically I think in part works to the effect\nOf as you mentioned yesterday would they be trying to get some of this information out so the Democrats don't have the claim that this wasn't a thorough background check\nThe facts of the matter is you're not going to you're only going to interview people were first hand knowledge or people that were said to have had first hand knowledge anyone else isn't going to be included in that process the point

nobody knew and so they were you interviewed all the people again just to make sure and if you knew people no direct cooperation of anything happening right so there's a we are but I Want to play this year from a Tucker Carlson I'm\nA with a fires she cared the American civil liberties union national political director they put out an ad where they had Kavanaugh side by side with Bill Cosby\nYeah it's a terrible slanderous ad and let's put it this way any it'd be a show you ran that ad against a private citizen they'd be sued for millions of dollars a there is no even\n\nThey're not even trying to hide anymore that they're not about civil liberties that but I don't believe in the presumption a benefit but I just want to play a part of the interview the back and forth because it gets to the point of being in sane remember the American civil liberties union what are they what why were they created to defend people's individual rights\nTo protect people that have been wrongly accused not just wrongly convicted wrongly accused\nBut the presumption of innocence is always the ... the number one thing that evidence is what determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to exist to protect people's civil liberties their their civil rights here's part of the back and forth\nThis disgusting at obviously but what's so distressing is thinking and ran it because this is guilt by association the very thing the ACLU ... again string for instance the blacklist period [noise] he'll casualty and break up and I have nothing in common in the twin them\nIn order to discredit capping off how could you do that because he really\nAppreciate your comments Tucker the common thread here courses powerful men whose careers are on the line issuing denial about sexual wrongdoing and this and then can simply believe that ... by Brett Kavanaugh goes right to integrity\nOpposition that he's a pie foreign stuff out in the Supreme horn and what she said in judgment of the rest of the nation integrity is on the critical importance to the most important thing when he had without about him and\nI I agree and I I Would never arguing against the importance of integrity like Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes\nIn court and we allow us to one of the the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like whew once defended capital has not been so telling them together is by definition guilt by association and unfair who do you think is the person your position Twenty years ago would have seen that\nThis isn't a civil or criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job by now assessment\nOf the standard of proof hairs on a brief beyond a reasonable doubt so then why don't you get an extra money who has been tried in ... he is not entitled to the presumption of innocence of you is how it was assumed that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job I'm I'm I'm not sure what am I hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asking you why you put them next to a man who was tried in court and can felonies and sentenced to prison\nBecause if he has another I noted hadn't done any of those things that individual also denied the accusations I think he would appreciate how can that we're criticizing people on the left and I don't care what the left and right I have to make the country was when she wants to do it and now you hear an eight on\nSo that also has certainly made\nSexual assault has taken very seriously here darker and I think that we're all in the crowding out the boy says a woman and believing the Manhattan\nNot believing women in this case this woman came forward oh we're not home user circumstance here here's a sale on your the ACLU\nYou don't believe in collecting judgment or collective punishment and we've lived here when you believe that they're going to war by the organization or you may have been a lot of the nation as an individualized determination about this woman just hand or I actually was actually thinking I hear that can reasonable mode so why wouldn't you say it's about women\nBeing heard when of course it's not the only one woman making one allegation that's one man says there hadn't been other men who denied accusations then that we use that and all we're saying is in this instance like in previous says women deserve an opportunity but it's hard to hold on suing your endorsing\nJudgment and collateral damage later she had\nOther women have nothing to do with it than it is a woman has had a ... is on the merits of the issues against Kavanaugh has\nNot been honest and forthright Tucker I Believe is that he come forward and said listen to\nAll of us were yelling at some point in life we saw a thing now you're getting now you're just joining how fast when they ask me what I Want to let me have well let me ask you and I wanted to know he is on the ACLU is the reason that the first amendment was defined\nIn Clarence Brandenburg versus Ohio case in Nineteen sixty seven he was ... and you guys defended his right to speak and that's why I have a right to say what I think is true the it was now decided they're not gonna offend anybody they disagree with\nNo sir I mean we have ... we are defending right now we're ... we're defining window\nFunny they disagree with no sir I mean we have ... we are defending right now we're ...\nWe're defining what else do you want to hear in his name another room without hell you don't have any holiday when people on different ideological eighth here I mean I grew more than the air out because you know I'm trying to this is my first of all\nLet anyone Menlo unless they\nNot going to assist in cases it may advancing also white supremacist or other as soon as the themes are contrary to our values if you're not defending people who are unpopular disagree with white hair styling exist we absolutely defend the people we are hearing is that right\n[laughter] yeah hey I have a New York or defending the to look at it I have to order saying All right well yeah I mean [laughter]\nI've you know so it was not it was done at that point in humans [laughter] right well because they they do draw the line and they are a political organization\nYeah ... ... ... ... and ... and and he read remember when they they said they're going to change right that they're not going to defend people that don't share the same value right hope that that you've been you've blown it completely you were not going to defend their rights over there to free speech but again as we've said all along\nOn this issue there had been so many\nOff shoot arguments that had nothing to do with how Tucker Carlson right there was trying to bring it down to no wait a minute we judge this case in our system we judge this issue by the merits of this issue as we said earlier\nBecause somebody else has been sexually assaulted does not give them their opinion any more credibility on this particular issue the only thing that matters is the evidence to back up her allegation that's it ...\nIt doesn't matter that other women have been a criminally sexually abused just like if somebody was making the allegation that they were robbed somebody else who was robbed does not have\nA greater morality or greater credibility to judge that particular issue which judged on the evidence that exists\nAnd that alone but that's what it that's the only thing that you can go buy in the system and the ACLU is now saying to hell with that right\nCause no other case counts no other criminal case counts no other victims opinions carry more credibility just because of their victims it is the evidence and every\nParticular case that counts otherwise anyone can make the claim and\nIf you were saying we believe the survivors and you'd be have like the ... the ACLU or any organization or protester right now that is chanting the same thing\nThen wait for it because at some point one of you will\nBe falsely accused [noise] well you know when they say believe the survivor at that particular point mhm\nJust alone believe the be don't believe the survival which means believe the person making the allegation right well actually believe the survivor actually means believe that people make believe the person making the allegation is if they're if they are in favor of the political issue the the the actual\nA background political issue that we're really dealing has here as long as it's someone on our side that's making the accusation yes we all know that's what we all know what it really means fear but to say believe the survivor means you believe the person making the allegation irrespective of any other evidence that exists right\nBecause you can't say believe the survivor and ended up that no you can't you can't\nThat's on American to say that\nThat's an American that's not believing in the constitution it's not believing in individual rights it's everything that the ACLU used to stand for that now they reject completely and Tucker Carlson you know later on said he lost his temper ... temperate when he called them ... well you didn't they are ...\nThey are they're trying to be on their hands because they're trying to portray themselves as people that care about civil liberties when obviously they don't\nIt's all about politics to them look\nAt you and I have our ... our day to day politics that that we promote on the air but we also promote individual rights irrespective of our opinion on the issues of the day the individual rights and the constitution is still number one to watch says it's not so the ACLU eight six six Ninety right I
