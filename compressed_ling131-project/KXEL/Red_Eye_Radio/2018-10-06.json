just about ... seconds before we cracked open the microphones\nYahoo has did a story based on the American bar association the story they did they publish it on Tuesday\nAnd ignored the fact that the American bar association on friday came out and said look the president of the American bar association who said Thursday evening that they should delay the confirmation proceedings for Kavanaugh\nThat letter from the chairman of the committee that gets together to essentially go over it and decided that they go through a process themselves of of essentially a vetting and deciding if they're going to support the nominee or not\nBut that process has done behind closed doors and the president did not the president of the ... did not put that in front of them did not send that to the committee so the chairman of that committee on friday wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee and said\nI'm ... speak for the committee\nSo and there's you don't use even in a store and there and Yahoo News is still using this isn't the story they did choose day\nThe correction letter from\nThe committee chairman came out on friday but it doesn't matter doesn't matter what the truth is any more I was telling you that uh the same news organizations Yahoo on uh on on a Wednesday I saw that a mid morning put out a story and totally\nTotally try who they're going after we knew this was coming that Lindsey Graham would be a target now right because he's built so much momentum on the right ah after ah during and after the hearing last week\nWith Kavanaugh well they go after him full bore and they quoted him on something\nThe ah it's being reported I should say that that the Senate or has the three ... and it's going over them as we speak um keep in mind this is all behind closed

committee\nAre also has it but really well committee and it's not it's it's not going to the fact that\nIt's not going to do all that well the entire point is is is to make sure there's not a leak bought a here's the question if you don't like it out if you don't make it public\nDo you end up\nHanding it right or another great opportunity for the Democrats to say you're hiding from the people whether the normal process is to keep it quiet as we all know\nAnd I was at the rules are on the three oh too because it because that's an official for and so and and I really don't know it is there any kind of penalty for leaking something any information that was directly from a thrill to\nThat would be a good point because if that is the case then we'll never see it and the the debt you're right the Democrats complaint will you know as writing a story at that at our CPA about look this could help Democrats or Republicans in November either way that it goes\nSo you know the if the Democrats get there when we're there is no nomination or it's not no confirmation then\nLet's keep the momentum going and then the Republicans of course would you know with much much demonstrate or

McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right or the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that's when they blew the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that when I read\nThat was on a specific topic yeah I ... the\nSame thing harp right that's ... towers are short lived yeah sure sure this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about this isn't really about Trump\nAnd and reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal or interesting that they write this\nThe same day that you know do the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while\nThe never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump\nThe same day that you know do the same week that you know you and I have in the same thought going while 'cause the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now and and as soon as you look at you know talks about the capital is a\nPart of you know ... isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nBut I mean he's he's separate from that can believe that we talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nAnd and supportive of up cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump yes and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol [laughter] the one the one holdout favorite except for except for Bill\nChrist and I haven't seen anything from George Will head it's like\n... you know they're not part of the ... he he's not some and they ride and he's not some Steve Bannon insurgent and the judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment\nA Supreme Court nominee from central casting and it and you know and it's a great point spend twenty six years in public service\nAnd the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization from\n... from ... I think you have the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nUh we got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case he'll Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is\nBut it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture war because it's a war on it it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were we were never on that never I'm never going to vote for him we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us in rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults will see that what do we know man he finally got outside I I think back when I was only held\nFor air as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well ah you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me\n[laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west\nYou know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people that I Know that our number Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really did this is what you really we wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democratic side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\nCat that they listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a\nOr listen to the ... from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to this point of the actual election it's a binary choice mhm it's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or looking at right now saying\nWhoa you know who you know when when um oh who was that are trying to think of the the the the person\nOh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary\nRight yeah ah I I saw this week because I I Know I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media has a lot of people furious same excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and does that a Jonathan is it ... their ads are usually\nOn Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that when it came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after\nThe the the house report the ... report the

I mean it's going to go down to the whole forever but I I\nI Do believe that because the uh Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff firms and not on this but Adam ships and who will be talking about\nUh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bombshell a out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker [laughter] uh uh apparently telling the house or the house ah ah I don't know which panel it was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them\nHe talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official or at that time which without question shows that politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked\nAbout where this were what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on\nHas come true it is all come out in ... in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right\nUm that well first of all one of the first questions\nThe big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out you know there's not there you have there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that or Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam ship is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats are the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it and they know the Republicans Rome release of because Republicans\nYou know a in a in the in the Senate want to keep a this ruling affect that hey we\nCan't be bland but not every background check we knew of every ... of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I can finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ...

been doing and they laid the groundwork for it and the hearings by a claiming that he gets kinda artists and and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh\nSo what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and there is on the Supreme Court from this point forward there are going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or abstained from any boats\nMay have he didn't say anything they want to but they if they don't they can do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself [noise]\nOkay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they could Larry Graham those lawyers she'll screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere can't get anywhere with it okay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know try and no sugar that judges should recused themselves though yeah great at how well\nYou know when they lose the electoral votes than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process and we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were or even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I Can't\nFind a way we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the ... got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it's more\nFor their for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the economy at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't rule on anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them and that's not going to hold any water\nYeah you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister you know and it was like OK let's [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case\nOf [laughter] well that company is indirectly\nWorking with my brother's company and and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know\nFact that the well she's part of his family but\nThe ... the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that scene is on the court right now for the process not that they make a decision that we should always agree with in fact a a while I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em back or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but\nWe can talk about that but the procedure on procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with a case a it is not it is not\nDriven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with ... often out of context\nUh they did that with Scalia or but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nBut I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme\nTerms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nBut I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world but I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that is not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends for greater monies to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges\nPrivately what they believe about the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they don't even to the door this is my point earlier about what I Believe\nAnd now the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three of his secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some contempt came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the claim came out what they would do is look at that and go okay was there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh two except if they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but\nHere's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated in order to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rural ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction is well journalists court and then learning\nOf this this rule now puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official thrilled to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point\nNobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... rabbit would not have been able to\nBeen cooperative and then at that point it dies just like probably the thousands of other allegations yes and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades\nAnd that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now it makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white work to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about\nIt now you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight six six Ninety read I\nWas really much better record

his interpretation of the constitution and and that's what you know one of the this is one of the problems\nUh you know Alan Dershowitz his older than we are ... so he's an old school Democrat mhm he may have his opinions of what he wants day to day on do you know what we should do with immigration or or how far well welfare should go or what tax you should be\nBut I'm the constitution there used to be agreement between\nLiberals and conservatives on how they view the constitution that's one big difference that we have today and that's why you have somebody like Dershowitz\nSo were they were I

about Trump we're all deplorable now and and uh you don't make a great point in the never conservatives are the left by the way that that doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd and we have talked about how this has United the ... the Republican parties and the different factions and even the never Trump ... ... it has it has helped to unite them\nBack to coming home to the Republican Party\nAnd a couple of things that they wrote here they said Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they hid Mrs Ford's name from Republicans for six weeks thunder a lawyer midwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed and an orchestrated the ... of accusations\nMr Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive in this

sometimes for best to be puzzled that more than eighty percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a laptop or the reason and the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their mess that methods Republicans have figured out\nThat if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man as distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power sure\nRepublicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false village but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August call to superior character they know Democrats nominated\nAnd that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August called to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit\nVoters notice or is about the less will to power by any means necessary Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the left hates them as much or more\nThan they load Mr Trump\nConservatives understand that\nAnd for the American left\nThey are all the ... yeah I think that's a I think it's a great piece and right on target which is why you see I think more of a United front much more\nMore United front than I can remember with Republicans in a long long time a ... here and it's more than just about this it is about the fact that they now understand how far the left

are to blame for this country is right now [laughter] I've always said our listeners are the most important people on the planet and and they are\nI'm Talking about the non politicians [laughter] All right and\nAnd the other the other breaking news and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of beers a this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know\nA high FBI law enforcement official a former official well they held off Tom John Solomon or has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that have ... cues you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original uh a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day unverified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins Cooley\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign and when we got to the law firm they were well the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right and\nI Would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm that would be\nQuestion the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess a compartmentalized that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the\nCounsel for the FBI do as they say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers\nMeeting with lawyers right why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys made it\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ...\nThe Democratic National Committee he's private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy the compiled the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\n\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and it was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the size of court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide jak the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed\nA Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the ... law firm\nAnd the FBI we bought the state of this I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four\nYeah I'm going to accomplish season though you could do probably more seasons and law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones yeah\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today yes\nI Am I the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after ... after ... after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was destroyed the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and just ... well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the fire to court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for washing collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole ... everybody knows it's true I don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at ... news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out um and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years\nHere's the problem with having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant\nEven though right now on the left have gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario where\nDo you think about it can even applied to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a mill cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out\nMore of the truth and\nLike I said more of the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats dead wood Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that\nThey actually could have kept her name secret yes now that we know how background checks for gun and they keep it secret they could have kept her name sacred now I mean all the processes yes
