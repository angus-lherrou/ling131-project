Iranian smart guys for back with you again I was with you in September for weekend as I say the streets of effect on UPN had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next to Dave and ... it's actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get used to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the market's low show dot com where you can email me follow them into Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but again check that out of my Web page there are a number of topics I said I Would get to tonight's I Want to keep my word\nFirst I Want to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I never wavered in my position the issue and you guys been bringing up the last few days I thought I Would focus on first segment at least and see your response\nIssues really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them elites\nThe fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term argument an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here illegally and the argument might be quickly over\nIf they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and another caller so that why you know why is this going on is pretty simple so as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right they wouldn't be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but I just tend to have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nBut how 'bout they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no Sloan from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring an illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRomney actually had a right to use the wrong language soft and then we go again would language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with action is like a legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Alice island they were so happy to a vote landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build a wall and do everything to an dilute legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three twenty nine I'm Mark guys that are filling in for it I agree\nWith what I was told that easily expects Romney wrote oh\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell row tell a hotline at eight

A. X. the dot com mark\nI back with you again calls an eight six six Ninety ... we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see what friend in Washington DC and has to say about it I for it [noise]\nHey well they don't have a\nLanguage that you talk about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself\nBut I Do I used to do it but I'll marry you say American what actually we are us citizens in America and uh the liberals are not a liberal that's called radical there they actually have taken that word applied it to everyone on the side of this so\nWhen they when they were talking American\nYou know we think that it's just sitting here no there are thinking the whole this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them that means this is just normal stuff we're safe brainwashed when we say Americans and they they say American they've brainwashed us\nTo think that we're saying citizens and they and they bring more sense to think that everybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have one that says US citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be deliberate with what we say words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even when the air because the radicals or taking those words that choice that's what I said\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refuse to do it\nAnd when I hear that word America Americans it me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans you know North American so whenever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that oh and you know some of the songs right\nAmerica the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAnd and I don't want to concede the language limit at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit now we're Americans have passed for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're a national forecast for cobra electrons\nAn area of low pressure and we'll be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for ... hours throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas\nCome on up to you know\nAnd as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send them send us the poor and is not our problem right and it's your problem\nAnd then you can also add on to the middle of a deal on what we're going to stop the oil and stuff but you know\nAnd I yeah there's nothing like the right and center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong side of you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for all\nYou know better than I Do oh [laughter] that's a great call thing Steve appreciate\nIt very much actually I I I did apply um so tell me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I send soup and I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen then they you know some people but you know what [noise]\nUm it it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were having someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up all up to become president United States you could say well to me you a trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days I think in power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes\nBecause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents with an odd I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's money your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay do my share but if anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after taxes\nLie to good people exactly why do people want to serve ... especially people in that sense why and ... leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you had to live your life\nYeah there there was a party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things he's limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get\nAnd I don't try to indoctrinate them I given both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have anarchy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think ... mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest crime and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they do this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant so there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of\nAnd the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate can override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional\nThey really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut you most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ... filling in on right on the radio\n[noise] sort of

[noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two States Army to get a little that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say that I Am very concerned about the race on governor and senator and Florida\nAnd the rates that senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm a several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year\nAnd a the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had relatives who live in Florida\nAnd I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside and Texas I I think Cruz is going to win I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial races is also if he so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal which they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate\nI think we're going off and the individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ...\nCongressional um situation and and I'm In you know Florida or tech this by them I don't understand you know I often don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race take one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care and they can do a lot of things on their own as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats\nDon't you don't understand that for their own their own them\nMe down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrat to invest and and you know be\nTrying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight it it's very hard to explain to conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use a livable wage these things are the ... on the surface if you don't explored they oh that sounds like a pretty good idea or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about and I turned to the same job necessarily\nA and then it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was born with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's ... American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving that aside\nThey treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way we've announced that he did want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on illegal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or ... road law\nArea of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit to you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region attraction Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots are showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas or going to get about another inch of rain today\nBut the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas or going to get about another inch of rain today\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia and I kept my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby now of course I could go wrong if babies late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of your dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville a jury my arms mark\nYes sir hey I'm your on your mark how're you doing well great I'm well I'm\nI recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant\nUm well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe left she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to a green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous the previous speaker was talking about um\nYou know people don't know about this a whole lot um I don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard\nEverything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever know I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is the issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to\nJust stay here and and uh\nIt it it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything\nThat I guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence um act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are serious the fast track to a green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking to my father's rights and what happens is the court system and in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMoran Mart I keep hearing these wonderful terms thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have a illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going all these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and more being invaded by the failures of these other parents\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf there was any if it was their military doing it we will be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent lay allowing this to happen this is absurd\n\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe is anything special about the United states of America as a United States\nThey just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against the President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issues not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to ... there's so many good calls here and let's go to Stan in wire loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that ups than Iran with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a Greek call you know\nSing Pennsylvania I probably messed up standing around with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey and who is visiting here and so I'm a escaped enemy territory for a while it's a hope we can get ... out of\nTheir all God but I'm just calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where I heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people illegals\nNot only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and are sick and um you had to stop that and if you remember like during the ah was when we were setting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is they were taking a people who are voting\nAnd dying their ... you know there's some purple you know here they couldn't vote more than once\nAnd I'd say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here [laughter] so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nWell you you you know the whole controversy over a voter id and the other side and had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal you know or being races were made in this you know how can you do that yet I don't know by the way my position is different than most people don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put forth some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or you get to vote on the same day voting rights and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also a about a year so the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and then saying you know well\nHow about on election day when somebody goes into vote and you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting wherever they just\nTake your picture and start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace\nTo you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of a person and say you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could check in check and see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting a voter id for you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card in a week or so you know or you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nAnd then well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want ... thank you so often Emily I Know that but there's another point that but you didn't think of\nI don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen that people work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name has the Pennsylvania yes or no no I'm originally you know yeah I'm right right so you go in the\n... who are you oh Martha and that's when you go over to that table\nYou're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever want to see ... provisional ballots yeah it is scary so if you had a he also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you have some ideas but they're not going to work have agreed to evening\nI tell you one one thing I did have that went into vote one time you know it was a primary and um they had a they asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nRight and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write imbalance I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like\nTotally me they said well you know what's going on and he said well uh oh oh you know you're you want to vote Republican and goes a guard or a Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could do says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I I thought it was I thought it was the worst I thought it was gonna say you can only\nA write in on the Democratic side you can't run and if you're a public why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time I mean don't you think he'd six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of some thirty three thirty nine Marcus there for an Iranian [noise]\nAnd

that to me\nI well I I don't argue you may be right but my understanding is if their child is born here and that's one of the calls an anchor baby and those anchor babies are American citizens\nWell that's a ... a propaganda that wants you to think that way that the way if you're the parent has to be under their sovereignty or the American government\nAnd gets to give you another example I can imagine the saying goes in all its name any decade in another country and has children their children aren't automatically ... they have to have some kind of\nLanka residents say in the United states before they hand over ...\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have the parents don't have to have a ... as you say you find the citizens of sovereignty\nAnd ... and the colors can let us know if we're wrong but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's when you see the people come here all the time we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital and people come here from other countries and tried to time and so the baby can be born here\nI I if I'm wrong call me an eight six six Ninety read I I Want to know I don't want to say something is incorrect let's go to\nLet's go to rich in Charleston South Carolina richer on with mark\nMark good grew on a day job and I don't say Phil and because we had a concept when I was in the navy you're sitting in the chair you're the commanding officer you are doing a great job okay thank you um Yes sir Yes sir great great job like I said I'm On my point is this here's here's the thing\nWith the purists definition of terrorism as a understand it\nTerrorism laws on the the fear of the use or the fear of the threat of force of violence coercion intimidation too so do the opinions of views the will of the people that is directed at\nSo\nI think it would be safe to save her at the list is by and large are domestic terrorists\n\nThat would be something I Would think that would that's that's that's the way I'd go with that I mean if if I mean look there they're shooting at the ballpark shooting up Steve ... though you know I mean the by the grace of God the man still alive today\nOkay um you just you just had a conversation with a gentleman couple callers ago and I I think you might call me correct me if I'm wrong I don't want to put words in your mouth you might become you're you're a little bit worried about what happens if we do when\nThe house and the Senate by a large enough margin what are they going to do now mhm\nSo you know I Hope that people are going to vote the way they see the facts rather than not vote a certain way because of the fear of intimidation oh gosh hold on to antifa people can't even drive down the street in Portland, Oregon without having your car ravaged\nYeah no no I did say by the way I did say I'll take my chances of winning I'd rather we in and see what happened so I'm not going to lose be intimidated by them\nOh okay okay then I stand corrected Yes sir Yes sir so yeah I mean and that's what I mean look the whole thing with a with the Charlie Hebdo shootings or Europe Europe was going to be gone and in ... years but because they're scared to death to do anything about the problems they have they'd rather I mean look at London for God's sake\nWell and let her know I've\nHad people on the air yeah I've
