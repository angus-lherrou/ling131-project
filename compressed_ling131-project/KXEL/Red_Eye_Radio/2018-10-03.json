bloods wildfires yet you candidates are running on climate change I loved that one on Amazon to pay Fifteen bucks an hour that seem to be a big story yesterday we went to that what happened to the size of documents story and a Russian collusion\nBecause that story just has been buried since I don't remember that one what was that throughout well it it doesn't that nobody has has covered it in and we did all I think about a week ago we we brought it up we said oh\nSo Trump decided not to release it but\nHe didn't go to the he didn't go to his the director of intelligence\nAbout the uh the information whether it should be declassified he went to the inspector general we don't go to the inspector general pretty quiet the classify something you go to the inspector general give something because you proceed there might be corruption and what you have ... for governor electronics user forecast\nIt may not sound like much that an area could get six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings but that's what we have over the next couple of days\nIn effect from multiple states including California Arizona Nevada Utah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil Roxanne tree limbs and flood dry creek pets\nUh from people he claims inside the Kremlin the unverified dirt on Donald Trump and we know who's done with that on verified dirt so that's where the Christopher Steele you know whole thing comes comes in a ... to this ah\nAnd ... and one of the key players they're fusion GPS a was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of Justice Marshall\nBruce Bruce or a name we know what they used to be you know the the ... and ... and all that ... well\nSo we wanted well wait a minute just doesn't make sense you you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nA\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday or Tuesday and we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over and we went we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general inspector general\nYou know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it and and and uh\nAll of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is\nA fact that people at the Justice Department are under ... and the Obama administration were more working to get information and use that false information that Dr yet\nOr to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a ... a warrant then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nIt it leads to the the the claim\nThen that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nWell and it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani ...\nThat ah the he believes they committed perjury right yes not that they they they signed documents stating that this information is intelligence mhm when in reality it was simply you know of opposition research and I was and they knew that it was an intelligence and they\nVowed for it's\nOften too often to study our credibility in and and you know again that's what Giuliani said we don't know but it only goes to the inspector general\nIf they believe people there because our would begin that if that was what had happened right things than it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to go in this case you know Christopher Steele or an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know he was involved but\nBut if if you if you do the unrest action and and they're saying bullets too sensitive well that would be again\nThe director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general in the head of the FBI a foreign powers\nAnd so you wouldn't be going in that particular direction and probably you will be discussing it especially with my ... secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release you know what do they want to keep quiet and\nNot that that may not be that that could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already but to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it look at why\nInspector general only looks at corruption right they look at corruption in the department he's looking for corruption in the department of justice\nThat's what his job is his job is not to declassify it's not just jobs not to look at a a document say wow I don't think you should declassify and and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out\nSaying well wait a minute he's inspector general under that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they on redacted it apparently someone in the administration looked at it and said this is corruption given to the inspector\nGeneral because that's because that's what you would look at it the ... the inspector general's basically uh their to investigate what happened in in the Justice Department I mean that's the whole purpose of that position to do that as a centrally that internal\nAh investigation have the the inspector general's office really as internal affairs or you know to a large degree so when\nAnd and when they saw that I could see General Kelly\nLooking at the president and saying Mr President\nIf you come out and point things out that's going to be purely political right so it only has you know there's we we have to build a political will to go after people if the inspector general\nComes out with an official report that's different that's what the president and the end and uh ... sessions couldn't go after people for this\nIt's that it would start in the political arena if you have this over to the inspector general who was appointed by Obama this is a process by the way if if you look at a you know the things that Trump has done\nNot talking about you know the things about uh the licensing for the NFL or or or licensing for the media the FCC licenses for the media or any of that not not the words not what he said but what he has done he's been very respectful of the process and this would be the process you would want to go through\nTo see that have the inspector general look at it\nAnd say please take a look at this and and do your due diligence here\nTo see if this is exactly if if it's what we see and then you notice the media you know you had some ... websites covered I didn't even see Fox saying why the inspector general for how they somebody may have done it I've not seen it and I haven't seen it on their website right but I haven't seen\nReally anything maybe ... or maybe a\nA you know National Review covered it the federalist I don't uh you know I Andrew McCarthy did I but I didn't see it right but it just the media went completely quiet on it but the other thing that I noticed was\nDevastating as like a couple of days after said I don't know why they didn't release that I don't know understand why I went to the inspector general and all of a sudden everything's gone quiet on that front to yeah everything that you haven't heard from Jim Jordan you haven't heard from a ... noon as a in over a week on it saying look we need to get this stuff released why\nRight because if it goes to the inspector general they're looking at corruption\nAnd well what would the corruption be if it's about the Pfizer warrant and the text messages and everything in the upper management of the FBI and the department of justice there's only one thing that it could be because that's what they were ... and that would be corruption inside of the department of justice\nAnd the FBI and maybe some of the intelligence agencies and and what they did but specifically for the inspector general it would be at the department of justice and the FBI corruption that's what he would be looking at this\n\nAnd so yeah one so we put two and two together [laughter] a little over a week ago it was like oh and there's been nothing on this story none of the media the media\nIs going to be quiet on the ... higher Russian collusion narrative\n\nThink about it I mean I Know right now the focus Kavanaugh but they're they're very capable of a walking and chewing gum at the same time when it comes to going out at a drop in New York Times brought up his family tax yes exactly why not collusion mowers that story\nBut that's a great point you made us you know he's going to the process and ... if you look at it and they ... somebody said look if you release this then they're just going to say you're cherry picking and you're interpreting I don't know what you're saying you're interpreting something here that really doesn't exist here you go to the inspector general nobody's going to debate the inspector general no\nNot even not even the the the Democrats he was appointed by Obama right Michael Horowitz was ... so you go to him and he bent and he does it which is the proper process to do with it yes that way you take the political aspect out of it right\nAnd especially right now if you look at okay all the claims that well this would be a disruptive of the of the more investigation\nBand you know the president that actually you know acknowledge those claims but all of that's taken off the table when it's when horror which takes the investigation himself all of those claims go away\nBecause or which will you know even though you know the president want want to just on a ... in an expedited manner or which will do his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine if there was any corruption\n[noise] if you want to get anyone to have a line open eight six six\nSo we'll do his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine if there was any corruption\n[noise]

group one guy were out on the boat talk and he remembered twenty seven years ago he put two and two together that I put him in jail for carrying a non law a weapon he could remember that he decided he needed to leave the group and come back home\nThe man remembered that because that was a pioneering moment in his life and all I'm trying to say is this woman\nIf that had been such a defining moment in her life she she can remember that that was Kavanaugh one hundred percent on top of her she cannot tell us how she got to the party how she got home\nAnd you know if it was such into finding moment in her life how did you be at home where was this house that would be things you would think a person would remember if it's such a defining moment\nAnd now all of a sudden it's just last move the

just crazy to me\nYeah I mean that's part of the ... the weakness as we said nobody is just credible or non credible edge see you have to take it you know based on the evidence that exist and their testimony and when the ... or whether the testimony that they give especially when it comes to these witnesses notice they were there and when those witnesses or act in the ass and say\nSorry we weren't there don't know about it at all and even one of her friends at that point your credibility starts falling apart and we don't know the where the when or how\nOf everything surrounding it yet you are a hundred percent sure of the PRP or at that at that point you have problems that you and your credibility problems\nIn any case and not just this case in any case\nYou would have complete and total credibility problems which is what the prosecutor\nSaid yes and this is what it comes down to is is uh can you put a case together based on all the evidence and and it does again it's not a criminal case so it doesn't rise to those standards but it would be very different if there were a number of people let's say even two or three other people\nThat were at that party or had a first hand some kind of first hand knowledge of that event and their stories mimic what she was saying\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate if you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test like if you don't and and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody's brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used and say these witnesses these people witnessed it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will\nHave you ever helped anybody else to take a polygraph test you know and and you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating no\nI Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes because she\nIs using the she is using the polygraph as cooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\nIs that the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you are telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to again because she was always telling the truth right\nHer attorneys on Tuesday in Florida the FBI to interview her and act on an investigative leaves a leans they have provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct\nAllegations against Brett Kavanaugh quoted as inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr ... allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are Deborah cats and Michael Brown which wrote a top FBI officials enter a letter obtained by political uh\nAgain it's not an investigation no this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talk to her at the end\nAnd also then we'll wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they well they if they don't I understand why they would not because it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing a background check\nOn Kavanaugh and so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or ... not to get their statements because they have their statements by the way\nThere is they don't get to know the the the attorneys her attorneys\nDon't get to know who the ... who the FBI interviews or who they don't including people that they say they told the FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with is\nThe FBI may be doing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her\nThis is a background check on Capitol it's about her claim\nBut she is not this is not about getting or any kind of justice she does there there is a no there is no right for them to be a part of the process\n\nFor them to be included or directing the process I Know they think that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera\nBut that's not how it works with a background check process you may we may not ever know\nThe American people may not know cabinet may not know who they talked to who they interview and and political here I'm renting from keeps using investigation it's not an investigation it's a background\nCheck as the timeframe for completion of the inquiry draws near Ford's attorney sought to call later Tuesday with beer officials to discuss the investigation\nYou don't get to do that now it's not an investigation it's a background check and it's not about her\nIt's not about Dr Ford it's not about the claim but she does not there is no there is nothing they're going to deliver she's not going to get another day in court this this is not a criminal legal process she doesn't get a copy\nOf the background check up only the senators to that's right and uh as well while McConnell Bob and only centers will be able to look at the FBI's final\nOf findings ... minority leader Chuck Schumer pressed for the public release other redacted version of the report but Republicans are worried about breaking precedent by releasing such information they don't release information from a background\nWrite I write a which will be made public available to the Senate the before the Senate votes this week I'm Kavanaugh's nomination according to GOP leaders all one hundred senators will have access to the report\nIn a secure studying for the FBI releases it as when he expects the report into multiple sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh to be completed he sings said I think it will be sooner than friday but I don't have\nA an exact date by the way we will find out what's in it because you will have a Democrat Senator I'm almost positive release something or half\nOr a partial part of the transcript that would be damning mhm uh you know to a to a cabin on in the context of not the complete\nParagraph or sentence or wherever right uh and then it would force the Republicans to ah you know released a holding release the entire thing so I'm\n\n... to\n... I think you're going to see likely are either because if the investigation as as the report came out late in the day on to say that the investigation is winding down then\nBy the way I Am down ... the U.S [laughter] I think you will not do we know but my point is well I was there the report slide investigations are technically I was correct but yes as as the reports came out and that's that's exactly how everyone is phrasing of yes\nAnd so we're doing is a criminal investigation and it's not it's around ... because that's what they wanted they wanted a criminal investigation that was never going to happen\nIt was never going to happen but keep in mind there they are they they were given a clear directive and scope and in terms of the timeline\nYou've got to get it done in seven days so of course if it's done let's say the the interviews are done or the reports still has to be written so imagine that the that that the interviews are are winding down\nThe the interviews are done for the report still has to be written so imagine that the that that the interviews are are winding down now and then maybe only a few more to do on Wednesday than the paperwork has to be done to submit the report\n\nAnd that likely will take what I did least today\nAnd they were then we and we we've been told that they can get it on the earliest today later on today yeah well if you have multiple people talking about it there would be one person one lead likely at the FBI\nThat were compile all of what the different ages found because it's not just one agent and it's not just in one town in fact that they're doing these interviews so it's it's all over the country depending on where those subjects of those interviews are\nBut the point being is that that it's likely one lead that's going to compile all those and it's likely a series of reports of the interviews and that's\nIt wouldn't be a it would probably just be transcripts of the interview\nAnd and then a summary on each interview\nAnd then the the lead would be responsible for summarized in the entire report I guess I'm guessing\nIf you want to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I\nActually would already sold for ... the reality [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nights radio and shoveled tele making your hardworking journeys more manageable to keep you trucking cc are\nTires who served as dedicated to providing\nHigh speed your surrounding it to ... demoted service\nHundred service so I've been a lineman\nSo let's just say we're obsessed with us or the other\nIf you do they you know all about [noise] well here's one reason you don't have to take any more than we are by the internal ...

Bush and they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember but Robert\n... why does started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos in the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell in pain or they were saying we're tough enough and the budgets when you look at you know twenty ... twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone when that was it that ah that that\nThat I'm Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty\nThirty oh that that was a that would have been a three hundred dollars that well that where I Know it would've been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty twelve okay it was the summer spring southern Tony ... so it was before this one and two of election but yeah All right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical\nYou know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right I mean that was oh no no no that's that's\nUnacceptable now we give the president credit or do in fact I I think it it falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because you and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it done why\nBut but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger\nAnd created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending the coming on the on the the campaigning on twenty sixteen\nFor ... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when ... came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh uh uh again in the shot down the shutdowns of never been about tax cuts the shutdown spend about spending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats who write every mild rhinos who recalled the swamp\nTrump was coming in to get rid of the swamp stop the spending to stop the sand and even going out to the\nThe uh the school lunch program you know in the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything\n... and so when you got goes back even though even much for when he got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and uh a banner was leaving an and wind was coming in Bangor didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected of Brian\nWas to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he was automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... that they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the ... the the president back then furious they wanted him out\n... got to Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos south to swap out we've got to cut spending\nLiquor we are today and so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party\nIn in just a you know roughly a three year some pathway well remember we\nGo back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket\nFor conservative street cred\nRemember if the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate and it was our final question to ah the light of Andrew Breitbart\nYou know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was that was still early but but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know that I think it was pretty obvious by that point\nBut he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should do back him and his answer basically\nIt was pretty obvious by that point but he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should do back I'm In his answer basically what's called us because it shows which by the way rings so true right now does today and thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words\nBut I think it's important but yeah I mean look at history and and see what why anyone swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts it was a everything on ... bean or why no and Vina but now it's changed mhm\nBut back three years ago yeah swap state now but yeah a swamp as deep state a swamp is what's going on right down the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah good sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McConnell right now\nAs part of the swamp well I don't think no matter who's a Republican leadership right as part of the swap if they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget that they did this year and last\nYear [laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up at arm's these guys gotta go not a peep that shows you the evolution it's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation of where the Republican Party has gone you know we're in a war against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of\nWhat those terms meant back three years ago and the fact that the definition has evolved completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is a Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you were going to we're going to ... we're going to cut as to where they are today because they're simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has gas\nIf there were pressure that there were pressure right now on spending on Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all that would have been done it would've been a priority and the president is not wrong for focusing on national security and and border control\nBut it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question the mindset of the matter is that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away we just want\nThe penalty to go away and we said litter the but look at the polling from five years ago\nA until they were discussing it last year and you could see the I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the we need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates and the benefits we like yes\nWell as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending wherever and you're not going to control debt and that's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no\nBecause there was no bad there's no there's a small core as well what do we identify a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right but might be concerned about it and maybe twenty to thirty\nRepublicans in Congress outside of that if you you there's no base to

there's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell make cars here and sell them elsewhere because of all the rules and regulations we'll put on cars in all of North America and Canada

American voters favor a that an investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's late ah [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals who will be screaming for transparency the first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple years or so\n\nOr you know it's interesting that it seems like a after two years Americans are paying attention and probably to the Russian investigation of sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started mhm uh is uh is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats in there like we said they believed that Trump committed collusion\nAnd they want to find out when everyone and wanting to release it to ... to ... he committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nA you know beyond that to a typical party line number of ... you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which\nMeans there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that and who knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think\nThat it's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying that that doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparency\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to well we talked about earlier because we received an email we talked about and we believe it was early last week and and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole buys a warrant application and and and those Twenty one pages\nWe're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey it's just disappeared person is going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story right well we did a a early last week when we said because we were sitting here on the air\nThe Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guy just started talking about casually on the air and saying hey I mean what the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know to get it because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies\nOr we're going to release it to ah but ah we're a even we have so much action for our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the saying an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're released something because\nUh to go through the saying an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're released something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be might get advice from Mike Pompeo because as a former CIA director and talking about OK what or ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and and information and Christopher Steele that they didn't want released but we still started thinking to ourselves\nWait a minute why wouldn't go to the inspector general his mentor general ... we don't understand that doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh\nYeah so in the un redacted version\nThey have found information that they wish to give to the inspector general of the United states whose ... of ... the inspector general of the department of justice and whose job is to find corruption and the abuses in the department of justice\nBecause you look at that on an aerial imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that and certainly a you have Kelly in the room with him and then that advising as chief of staff\nWhere do you go with this I could see General Kelly looking at us and and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nIf this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the Obama administration\nIf that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here than this actually will require Horwitz the inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes lot\nYou take the politics out of it because you let the G do all the investigation on it tell us what happened here\nBecause the I ... going to have\nAccess to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans\nOn oversight committees and really the White House the White House has been calling you know the echoing ah the the the the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the G doesn't have to call for that they are gee has access to it directly yet so the I. G. takes this\nAnd the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this uh on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president\nWhile the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents but the I. G. has access\nTo everything in the department of justice and any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president wouldn't it would it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to to be handed over\nAnd you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively at just declassified part of life because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are you a context them everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about or that you know ... Nunez initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and but why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you hear nothing\nRight and\nThe media's not covering it really the mainstream media idea even seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector\nGeneral\nWhy is the inspector general looking at all this they only have only looks have corruption\nRight that's what he's he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material has looked\nAt it already and it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say what Russia probe right which one which one because I read it and said oh Russian pro which Russia probe\nWe initially thought you know because because I I'm On the one time they said well Mueller's in but there's a limit for Mueller's investigation right but on the tweet he said Russian probe right and I went\nOh that must have been the Mueller investigation that [laughter] [laughter] right might not be you know it may not be an investigation that they're talking about he didn't like the mother said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look\nAt the pattern of behavior in the in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right now what was that pattern of behavior\nLeaks to the media how many of those leaks favor Trump the almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have this situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department\nThat\nAre not obviously not Trump on Trump's side\nIf if there's an redacted classified material had damaging\nInformation about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case would he also turn it over to the inspector general if it more\n\nBecause it wouldn't serve him ... does not required to turn it over to the ...\nRight but I don't think this I don't think any of this has any information that Trump was involved in this was all the FBI and the department of justice I Know", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "03"}
