can remember the last roller coaster I was all this was at a at Opry land as I recall I may have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred and sixty degree\nA thing is kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our gifts to pay tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second [laughter] do you do you don't want ride that was\nYes I Do actually I was one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew which pays years just give you ...\nThat that was a while by shutting it was called the ... or something along those lines uh and it was very short it only had that one little uh that one that one little area but yes I'm very\nI think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little law that one that one little area but yes I'm very familiar with it and are\nAre in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and then of course Opry land was a great place to attach to put an amusement park right next to the er the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was a how shall I put an exhilarating [noise]\nUh I I must be definitely woke me up by our remember that that uh we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers who were there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a a little bit tired at this point and and uh\nHe woke me up Yes sir [laughter] that there'd be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did [laughter]\nIt was actually called the ... Bosch cannon ball of fire is if I ...\nThat are well anyway I'll put it this way it did lead me say this was awful just let me saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a gift to the park I got to ride for free okay that's what I paid to do it again no not really big them again of course that's that's just me what are some of the place was out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\n... tribute go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually ah ah in I'm In law actually have started the I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween coming to places that come in line of course the universal studios\nAll which is their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse and\nSo a place where you have to be totally scared and and now you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World and Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and off for the kids and of course got the booty you a\nHalloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing uh some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all of the Six Flags locations have this fight fast\nWhich is your cleric classic scares own all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the sewer and this that the sewer souls and the witches layer and in places like that um\nAnd of course the the point has got hollow our weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or that that that goes on there are ... zombie high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into this big time uh I mean even the chain stores\nSound extremely we'll plus they changed the names of the rides sometimes\nUh for example over at ... uh which is a heroin is in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street uh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows\nAnd zombies and the and of course uh you know uh the the age old you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say that about maybe two or three dozen odd that actually do this and now they're just a you know the rise is still open the weather's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... basically Anaheim all we mentioned to the fight fast and the phantom lights over Kenny would a house screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens\nAre and of course ... and he's not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned plus others um during the day you know during the day\nIt it really isn't like that or it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places so if you if you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened by you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zones their actual zones\nWhere you'll you know you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly and very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will uh will tell you it ... it is easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are are just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or having an act I can't have a traumatic experience with that\nPart of the way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean at the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and I'm a there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know that they're probably not going to try to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gals\nOr or something along those lines so yeah there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know if if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I like uh he's in he's in parts and what they do and how they train people in order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many\nUh and again they're they're they're scarce zone than their non scare zones or you know if you're going into a scare zone and you know something is going to happen\nAnd I'm going back and then take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment\nFrom a cedar valley record or this is the voice of eastern Iowa New song Fifteen to the Waterloo Cedar Falls Cedar Rapids\nPrehistoric mountains more from the Iowa almanac in a moment\nWhether the fast food or actual sit down restaurants or you will find them at the amusement parks because it's a way for the entire family to actually get together\nA and enjoy a day I mean even the older people uh you've got scooters that they can go around with the scooter is\nAnd I have to worry about the walking you know the mild as they say four miles\nOn average that you would at an amusement park\nSo I think that's one of the things that was really really intelligent it was that uh that means in parks and not just geared for kids anymore they're geared for all family members and that's why they do so well\nSo it was more to compete tribute go an expert on travel and amusement parks and look at some things

morning also coming up we'll tell you about the the story in the wall Street Journal they actually took the Commerce Department numbers\nAnd figured out that a significant portion half of almost half of the increase of the GDP since April of last year\nOr the acceleration of you know it's going from roughly two point two percent\nAnnual growth for the last few years under Obama\nTo from the middle of last year to right now up two point nine percent half\nAlmost half of that growth just under half ... uh is because of government increased government spending defense spending federal spending increased state and local spending you and I talked about the flaws of the GDP\nRight you know and it's the only thing that you can go by so you go buy it and not that there was in government spending before but they looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nAll over the last year and said that is cause for half of it and the reason that it's important as you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what might affect that\nWe look at the good portions that we've seen mhm we've also looked at the things that can hurt the economy the the terrorists the increased because of that the increase in cost of\nTimber and steel and materials or the you know the the housing up or slow down over the the the last a month a government at times believes that they can\nAnd people believe the government can help the economy and at the same time manipulated into success ... by picking winners and losers and they can't look\nNot that there's anything wrong with increasing defense but I don't know um but what we want to do is set that aside and look at where the growth is and isn't in the private sector\nBecause the the the what creates wealth what really moves the economy is the new goods and services that are produced by the private sector ... and the GDP a lotta times takes in government spending and the transfer of money\nAs actual economic growth and it is not right up\nEight six six Ninety red eye if you want to join us for the bow to show for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nFinally a break in the rains for Texas high pressure remains clear skies today over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from I fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nAnd a good part of the mid west and south will see showers today most device Seventy five\nWill look to see rain later in the day it will be clear in the northeast the desert southwest and dry on the nation's midsection and western parts of the country with the exception of coastal Washington and Oregon and the Northern Rockies\nDallas will be sunny today up to Seventy two degrees now that's up ten degrees from yesterday and Saturday even better eighty\nHave that [laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about what's at the tweet was a\nDonald Trump junior the pointed out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media or yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well saying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice and to his residence and and\nIt was you know that got ultimately close to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things that happened um that\nAnd with any president or presidential family but especially this well\nYou've had how much you know that has happened had been said um and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you might\nFor the call ah this was several months ago but you're talking about when you call someone\nHitler what the threat is\nThen we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the\nWorst mass murderers and history pure evil you are saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes a threat that that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was and that's the ultimate\nThreats\nSo the cold for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president's\nYou got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer ... one of the most evil people to ever exist on earth that's\nVery different [noise] uh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the authoritarian mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we've said nothing indicates set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion about let me All right let me say that Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument\nThat that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is best promoted or his rhetoric may offend you\nMhm\nOr his provocative nature may uh uh offend you but what does he actually does does he deserve is it fair to relate to him to one of the worst mass\nMurderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal no is as pure\nDemonization an inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do it is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president\nWell let's look at this and his had too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same as the guy who\nAre committed a genocide of six million human beings in concentration camps\nThat's what Donald Trump is he's a fascist let's throw most selenium there too wild what you know ... let's combine Hitler was Mussolini and let's combine the worst\nBrutal evil people that have ever existed and say that as Donald Trump\n... well of course that's just the ...\nPeople that have ever existed and say that as Donald Trump\n\nWell of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say\nAnd the other point\nThat we made over the last couple of days is after the Steve Scully shooting a going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a a you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate\nMembers of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police he probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now ... ah they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve Sebelius represent 'em ...\nSeriously injured did that change\nThe rhetorical nature the inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they asked it up to the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh auditor insanity\nThe last couple of months the reality is it's not gonna stop\nWhy we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of their of of of free speech they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality of where we live and what is the thing that will temper that but we'll temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject\n\nMust reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so you know we we have talked about you know also the morality the media and and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason\nMhm the Russian collusion almost two years of it never ending pounding by the media\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defended and said look it's it's been ... they they'll live against this president coming from the media had been never ending\nRight the source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this is what our sources told us well if you care if it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe your sources well\nIt you know you have ah the remember the indictments that came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president tweeted a that day\nYou know no collusion and then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proven collusion something to that\nEffect nope nope no ...\nAnd asphalt that that is a blatant lie or complete incompetent either you don't belong at any you don't belong on\nTwitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of be at out\nMuch less a major newspaper because there was no proof none stills none\nTo this day nothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on and no one knows what more has in front of them know that may change but what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now\nIs the false narrative will think about this it was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days and\nBecause of Russian collusion right and trees no precedent now I have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last\nTwo years so let's move on to something something else and then they they attempt to walk away as if well no we bear no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nOn we're just really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh she got\nThere illegally he came to power illegally and with the help of another major nation that is the uh that that in terms of new is the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat\nAnd ah he is he worked for the Russians he's friendly with the Russians he's a fascist and he's capable of killing as Hitler was\nRemember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year and that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty sixteen\nYeah and we have a a an election coming up in what eleven days yeah and ah and where they screaming about that it's gone silent now why

exception of coastal Washington and Oregon and the Northern Rockies\nAnd six out of the seven said absolutely not\nI Wonder what they would say if you said what if Chelsea Clinton came in and ran\nThat would you run or campaign to write wherever it right you okay so ... did did bill and Hillary completely taint any possibility shelter you ever having a political career which is why she would only agree to do it if she would be appointed if somebody's stepped down a retired and she was appointed to that position imagine she\nRan in twenty twenty imagine that she just sweat\nAnd I mean it was just in a while and I got her mom's background going what\nReally my husband my daughter but not me [laughter]\n[laughter] it's\nMaybe [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] ah [laughter]\nIt's okay you get to be first mom [noise]\n... [laughter] ah yeah\nWe'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies yeah\n... this out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse me Michael I have an end to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nGrassy said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the Tucson to obstruct his panels investigation of the allegations of Kavanaugh\nQuote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley said in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\n\n... that would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly\nThat that that warrants an investigation I think\n\n... here's here's the question what if anything happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house takes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] with would pursue a a a a referral I I Would have\nTo look at everything that Grassley has but here's what he writes here in light of miss sweat Nixon Mr ... own statements to the media\nInformation obtained from many interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ... it has become apparent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the committee likely contain material false claims Grassley wrote in the letter\nGrasses across was not guaranteed Justice Department will open an investigation\n\nIs the last part of that and we'll send he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director\nChristopher Wray right\n\nBecause if the if the committee were to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen to them if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for\nProsecutorial means if you found that there was a wrongdoing if you through the investigation your own investigation from\nI don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape ... right right right and then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\nSo\nIt's not like you it's not like the uh the the the house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking to get you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or documents you have things in the sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the ... the desire\nTo pursue justice here oh that this will be the Senate so I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that while at the end it goes back to the political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses\nOn the the ... if the uh the\nTearing down and the shredding or the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process\nWe know that that was the you know the the hearings ... were about Dr Ford but this war was to add a this was adding to a an intended to influence the the outcome of the vote\nOn Kavanaugh the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire you know process while it was a separate from Dr for part of the camp a confirmation process so\nWhen you talk about doing the doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute or shred the process\nBut in the cell just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an of us\nAll when we had the lead come out and say look this isn't a trial this isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial and then and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is your under oh mhm if you commit perjury mhm\nIn you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury is you know that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but it is a political trial that has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley is going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward after it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the Grassley had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know\nBut if he believes that he can make that case for making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then had said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went in jail yeah\nSo should we say that when a political trial happens because that's what it was\nThat none of the law should be followed and all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it if you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put\nWhen and make a circus of it if you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line should you go after it I think\nThe majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question and kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes because it is it was an attempt\nI think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do was disrupt the process and if you do that through false means\nA boat giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process\nAnd if you if you can show that this was the clear intent here was to disrupt that process and you knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statements that were false I don't know why you wouldn't\nMove for well about ... whether they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice for just under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a castle ... because it does this really isn't at this point isn't about\nPolitical will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweat no or apathetic no so you know my question on the on the house thing is that soften the political will it's not about political will really\nEight six six Ninety red eye [noise] Bush with

Politico House Republicans frame Thursday's private interview with former Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos is further evidence that there is no solid justification for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation Papadopoulos of foreign policy advisor to president Donald Trump's twenty sixteen campaign\nBegan an hours long meeting with members of the house judiciary and oversight and Government Reform committee he's behind closed doors Thursday morning with Congress in recess until after the midterm elections however only three members were present Mark Meadows John Ratcliffe both Republicans and change we're asking of Maryland\nMedals called Papadopoulos of critical witness noting that he's\nThe person who supposedly was the whole reason that we have this Russian collusion investigation going on Papadopoulos is loose talk\nOr overseas about Russians having dirt on Hillary Clinton prompted a an FBI investigation into election interference what we are finding out\nOr without talking about specific ... what is going on is the whole reason that this investigation was opened\nUp was certainly not built on a solid foundation medals told reporters he added that some Justice Department an FBI staffer should be referred to the department of justice's office of professional responsibility to determine whether proper protocol was followed and I'm certainly willing to encourage that\nThe Republicans and Democrats are painted partisan portraits of Papadopoulos as a witness Ratcliffe describing him as very forthcoming he's providing as much information as he has Ratcliffe said I think he's trying to understand how would Twenty one year old irks me at twenty eight year old\nA campaign adviser who bet on the job for less than a month has been embroiled in the highest profile investigation and recent times\nHis testimony here today is certainly unique an eye opening and very different in terms of what I had come to understand from other interviews seen it from other interviews that we've had as it relates to FBI agents and department of justice officials metal says\nTo see it from his perspective gives me great pause and concern raskin meanwhile reminded reporters\nPapadopoulos his conviction he pleaded guilty last month the lines of the FBI about his communications with the foreign professor and was sentenced to fourteen days in federal prison suggesting has testimony should be taken with a grain of salt ah of course\nI'm as we know there's no evidence of Russian collusion [laughter] [laughter] so that's\nBut ... the ... office can walk in and can obtain those documents\nAnd no one can stop them why hasn't really why hasn't the conservative media\nFrom the very beginning talked about the fact of why this went to the inspector general for that the inspector general because we were still we were both on for the first twenty four hours not understand why she's gonna inspector jumped doesn't make any sense does it right\nAnd all of a sudden one day on the air mhm is one that I think it was the day after or whatever we said oh wait a minute 'cause we're we're we're we're like\nBaffled ... because they were making the explanation is if we can't do this because it could be due dead do damaging some of the top secret store allies and therefore we're giving it to the inspector general more like why why would you get to the inspector general if your word oh wait a minute the inspector general mhm looks at corruption you believe there's ...\nOn a because if you look at the the the\nScenario in the great possibility of how this went down it wasn't our foreign uh ally at once it wasn't our allies it wasn't you know Great Britain or anyone else that was that was starting this in order to derail trumpet it happened here at home\nWhich means that someone in the Justice Department in this case are quite possibly was was beginning this entire thing so worrying about what our allies are concerned with really wouldn't concern the inspector general's office\nNot at all will try to keep you updated on it right because we know that our listeners want to be constantly updated on that and that's why I said I'm getting\nConstant communication people getting frustrated saying what's going on you know I thought they might use this with the midterms are coming up now the inspector general now that is there that it it\nUse this with the midterms are coming up now the inspector general now that they're ... it's outside of\nThe authority now of Congress because the inspector general right as a part of the executive branch so whether the Democrats take the house or not is not going to stop the inspector general right but one wonders that before we lose\nIf we do need if the Republicans lose the house\nThat this all stops its investigation stops so you better if they win\nYou better get as much information out as possible but you want out to the American public mhm otherwise\nThe fear is it will be buried mhm and the American public will not know the truth because the Democrats and nobody's ever argued this when we have said that the Democrats actually do not want the people of the United states to know\nAbout the Russia investigation they actually do not want you to know they haven't been screaming for those documents to be released\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to

care\nThat's my whole point I don't know what the draw would be for for him\nThere really wasn't a draw your two hundred people yeah that's what I mean you could you could chilling now look at all of the probably not but up until now look at all the attention\nThan that increase goes away\nAnd as we said before the true growth\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democratic president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that\nDistorts the actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy's doing so without the increase in government spending\nA you would have had a a\nA ... a growth rate of of two point five six percent\nUp from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP\nThat's still what driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector\nIt's still not as much as government spending right\nSince April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last\nYear and a half when that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism\nFrom people who used to agree with us\nBut now disagree with us on the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've said it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost him good\nIn the marketplace benefits the economy\n\nYou don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states\nWhich was what the president claimed\nHe wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president does all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well and as we a breakdown of GDP Growth\nParticular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about\nWell and as we uh break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... the Pentagon and then as actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of their defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty\nTwenty so what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the growth is in the private sector or where the lack of growth is in the\nPie in the in the ... that you do yes you you do have to separate the two because government spending even for\nA quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not what it is that why you do it and but also that is\nThe majority of that money mhm of increase in that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect is not the same as in the private sector\nBecause a multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something\nThat makes somebody else else's life more efficient or makes their business more efficient they use that and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nIt really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having an economic growth think innocent our society thinking a smartphone yes you know like it is\nSo that that is that that great demand because it's at that because it's creates that efficiency and society and and and productivity increased productivity\nAnd that's where you see again that multiplier a big create that huge expansion and well and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nOn defense spending you will build the initial product ... but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business\nMhm what year ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something\nYou're using debt down the road where yes in the ... right long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector to improve the efficiency\nAnd productivity above their businesses down the line\nIt stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy has\nMeant that I made a difference you could make a a very indirect a\nLink to it and say that it preserves capitalism in general and the role but it's right but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector multiples are do\nAnd and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs and the cost of home building now when the cost of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know in in till the deal is signed are still on with ah with with Canada the increase you you talk about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talk about what ... what the
