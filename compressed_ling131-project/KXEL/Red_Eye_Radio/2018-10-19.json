Iraq War justified whether we should be it after I started at all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years but without jaded are they the country\nYou're thoughts police are\nAll I mean we have not been ineffective in Afghanistan you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacks over there I think we would have been done better if we had\nTaken a crowded out from Afghanistan or they had an opportunity to attack us which is something that we bought a ... during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I Know I'm not going to go back and say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I still had a hard time ... better off if we had Saddam Hussein and our\nUh that would be yet another vicious dictator or that we can now at ... or without carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes as a country I certainly make mistakes\nOr think about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way more than a unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nA one as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs have weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the government of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases\nIs are thinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick a particularly the second the Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the or\nThe underpinnings of the uh Saddam regime and the entire country will rushed to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road\n[noise] well that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen let us to do nothing in Syria where now and we have ... horses we have a weight anymore says and we have terrorists horses or you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything and we shouldn't be everywhere\nBut there are places what we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nWhere but there are places where we are going to have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nBut I think six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who comes in from east Texas cello Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now the historian at the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world that was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that mapped the world and that brought marketing pillows and and commercialism around the world they were going to map there were there were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us\nTo the point that we are today and I feel that is inevitable and America seems to be the uh the chosen vehicles or the inevitable\nA position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notion was against a you know I'm collecting dust notions and that's that's something that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do they depend on human actions but there's no question\nThat the caller's right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position\nOr that no other country was in an idle some of it has to do with geography you know we talked about being surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability\nTo send forces and maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there a that would eventually engulfed us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect\nAn international economy in a way that benefited our road so I think that's you\nKnow there is something special about America and we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there's an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by a certainly United States has shaped history and when it's when they said well yes\nAnd then and of course it is if this might be if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet in a position to be able to\nAh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a little uh uh to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo Hannon show dot com which means uh anywhere in the world and bus gill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight hello Gail [noise]\nHere's Jim I'm just one comment on uh on your guests are views on choking like Korea and like Japan has I'm Crazy a arrangements are with the United states and under certain conditions are we going to be a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict\nIs is there for Korea or Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize that are not that many years ago this war's United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many ah potential major conflicts exist and that is to say how much are just exactly how many countries out there\nAre covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters point taken\n[noise] All right let's let our guests commented about that that notion of a\nOf the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or the Japan with the with South Korea and the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict to Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies to them we will deter\nA China from attacking them whereas if we pull back and and and those kinds of Tibet is\nWhen will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we all get drawn in to conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain peace and not have to get into war is if we think we can stay out of the conflict\nThat involve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last century that we can stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd if we try to do so uh uh we we try in other words to go for quote the peace and honor now in our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about all offshore balanced SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties the consequences of that was we wound up having a fight on shore so I think it's better to provide the stability of the security arrangements\nStay with us more to come by one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Robert Kagan our guest is the Freedman senior

had an institution of slavery that the north opposed and didn't have\nAnd you had a neat dividing line and in fact Thomas Jefferson said you know in a way it's precisely because there was such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually [noise] you know the decisions we have today they're like\nNeighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagreeing with people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had\nBetween a slave holding south and capitalism north so I think we're we're obviously going great disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstances\nAnd I certainly am happy to hear you say that and I certainly hope but and I actually think that you are correct heroin me build Pennsylvania now leaving and\nCarol you hear you say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Gerald if to be a very long call Carol\n[noise] ain't going to say much all I wanted to say as I Am against the United states doing any first strikes well\nOkay I'm not sure that ah that we have an economy plated or as a matter of uh of your thought process Robert Kagan\nI guess we would have to define a further first strike I doubt that we're ever mind to go around let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of should of option\nAlthough my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which at proactively or engaging a problem before it gets worse at something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion beneficial\n[noise] yeah I mean we certainly I we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons in the first strike that stuff's not been our policy in it and it and I bet it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do it as intelligent live selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about\nYeah and they begin to be the key is in the term of first strike\nA more to come one eight six six five oh Jim boat what should be the American role in the world regardless of what we would like it to be what is the best role in a in a world that is

Joe hello Lance\n... is through Korean out warrior I'm worried for going um where are you ... you know the famous ... in ... very very highly competitive but I see a comparison\nOriginal ashtray tragedy or the comments\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources a road they will come to conflict rather than a compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people are still deep\nRooted hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical so I mean people just go get along at certain points in times when they think something of a ... a value for them or their their uh ethnicity is going to be taken away and jeopardize\nLet me off or a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnd other goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAt the time I said well first of all that was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next more but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is any of the only place I could have put on a par with and I suppose was was that somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that they in fact a later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you will want to look at those conflicts alone or South Africa which is still trouble today to be sure but there's been no all out war there\nA Northern Ireland which still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure uh Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[laughter] yeah well I mean I think the conflicts can be contained and that's what you know we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and help people of Asia other forever and fighting each other forever\nOr you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and\nThe Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries and people said well how can how can we expect to\nBring Europe to peace and yet and yet we were able to now I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily do in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim and you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example a\nAnd say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nOr not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nYeah and then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test here or there are things are made better I think that's a much more a plausible a litmus test for any course of action to thank you for your call ... we go to Charlotte Durham North Carolina Hi

win the house and at least take back ... party Congress and if they don't buy I Can't imagine what the reaction is going to be\nOn Tuesday Morning I talked about the great job that President Trump is doing and of course the unbelievable anger towards them by the resistance right they even that coined that phrase right away the resistance like you're resisting Nazi Germany or something or fascism and of course that's what they believe\nAnd I also asked your who'd be your favorite choice to get the Democratic nomination for president and who would you agree to have coffee with on the other side side by the way that was a sign that many of us ... troubles choosing someone that's pretty bad at it wasn't always that case\nI chose personally I chose Bernie Sanders because I thought he seems to me like he might be a pleasant fellow\nThat I'm ahead of what's her name of costs you know I always say the wrong and what's her name\nOr ... something Cortez Cortez she doesn't even ... and the latest ... who says that they asked her about whether they would support whether she would support Bernie for the presidential nomination and she said oh we'll have to wait how communications directors and we'll wait and see what happens all the a lot of loyalty they're up\nAnd I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might wind but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like you going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know mark I defended due to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that has a lot of text and going on [noise] it didn't even cost so much for second that I could be on the other side\nAnd another time there was a teacher's meeting and the teacher trainer who was running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room to all your teachers and you could tell something that would be interesting that we don't know about you\nBut do you think for a second I tell them about my other career life how come in the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia die than another teacher said mark what's playing knock knock joke so I played along and his answer to who is there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI probably didn't hide my look at the snake because he shot me 'cause he immediately walked away having no idea that I adore Justice Scalia and it was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching the public school system\nIt's kind of like the McCarthy Era traverse but I have to keep quiet about my political views I Want to know what you do if you have to keep a quiet at your job what happens if you discuss politics with your family or friends are on the opposite side you better not do that a Thanksgiving that's the end of that dinner\nAnd if you're a Democrat or left left to say I want to hear from you too but I strongly suspect that you are not disowned by conservatives among your family or friends if you even have such people you're friendly with I just don't think we do that on our side because we think your views are misguided and you think we are evil\nSo I Want to hear from people of all political persuasion on your experiences with people because of your political views\nI must be honest I've often wondered how Mary metal and you know that there she's married to a James Carville how can they be happily married with their views there so far apart [noise]\nDo you think you can you might want to consider this do you think you can marry someone who held strong political beliefs opposite of yours\nSo I Want to hear about your experience with people who disagree with you politically at eight six six Ninety red eye\nAnd uh you

white I've heard it several times\nTo anyway um the subject was about how people react to you and they find out your Republican and I have a son with autism and and the autism community it's very difficult to\nMake and maintain a friend or my son and he had had a friend Cynthia about four years old he's Fifteen now and I've been very good friends with his father who is that Democrat\nAnd jets recently on Facebook he asked me to not contact him anymore and please I trained him\nBecause I'm a Trump supporter and I just found that that devastating because they say you know over ten year friendship and he's willing to throw it away just because we think differently and I don't see where that ... berry\nYou totally support my thesis we don't do that you never would even think of that and he just friends you know by the way I guess it could affect your son's relationship with his son or daughter whatever it is they say it's awful it's unbelievable\nWar all that's all I had to say and thanks for taking my Long Island shed and no one night\nThank you very much and now you're national forecast for cobra electronics\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas there'll be a little

I mentioned my monologue Mary Madeline and er what's his name I just lost the carnival\nYeah James Carville or they're married and they were stream Lee opposite I worked in political campaigns for a total opposite candidates so here's how this may evolve [noise]\nCould you marry mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you\n[laughter] why not I mean if you're compatible in every other way and you you why why why there's one little facet of our lives defined everything you know of course I could\nPlay by like you're you're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay\nThe cost doesn't politics get into values somewhat about what people care about right as an example I'll get in trouble this I think a lotta times single women who vote Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them are and so you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe none marriage because it may affect lots of things oh can you know maybe this is where I teach my students values or what should cap not so much and I say it's my pin you don't have to agree with me not to and you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time\nIt's it's the person's values that you should care but here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that\nBecause you're conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day\nYou're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand\nHey you're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradicting myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent\n... share the same values and knees in this one of the nice thing to be friendly but I that's why I ... I Want to ask everybody to could you marry someone and you are very ... said sure why not it's one thing\nAnd when I'm pointing out to maybe it's not just one little thing maybe it's something very important what do you think about that\nYeah well I mean we're all Americans here I mean yeah I guess it could be some Haitians down the road but I mean if you like me and my girlfriend getting along and we\nHave a good report with each other and I love her she loves being I mean yeah I\nI you know I I I Can't imagine that coming up to the extent I mean I'm fifty eight so I don't have to worry about children which is a valid concern but I mean hey you don't want to go to you know\nPeople my mom and dad my dad was a southern Southern Baptists my mom was a Roman Roman Catholic they got along fine for fifty five years you know I I guess you all love each other's noses in it you learn to live with the other person it's all up marriages about compromise anyway so\nThat when you were good my producer is not as good as you he he's he said to me you're going to be divorced than five years anyway if you marry someone on the opposite views he used to be cynical\nWell you you have a good attitude about it I and you weren't consistent wind challenges you said yeah what what's the big deal and you're it's very fascinating that you said on these social media sites\nThat it's only one side this stuff you might not be a Trump supporter of his mark thanks for your call is amazing the hatred and the anger out there is just the you know for the president\nAnd anything you know that's associated with him right so if you work in the ministries you can't even have a meal\nThat's incredible it never happened years ago or they'll protests by your house on the ... what's going on as someone asked me that puts it well you kind of set in ... what's what's happening in this country\nAnd that's why I said the first nice I I think we're entering a civil war and this is so strong this is so big that some people that they don't want to accept it let's go to David in let's see if I can see that ...

time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really where are they when they found out on my news were I was in big trouble\nI've been friended I mean is this the McCarthy Era memory McCarthy who is you know calling everybody in communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's doing let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I Am a part time teacher and they don't know\nThat I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them\nAre not a ... million you know what shepherd I been one what kind of America do we have in twenty teens when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video road lock\nFlooding continues in Texas there'll be a little strange today to the forecast\nMore showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday from the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms were eastern Florida Today\nHigh pressure from the east and west coast of metal made clear skies don't look for clouds in the inner mountain west or the west coast also the deep south will be\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up on something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the fact that it's having on relationships friends family colleagues\nUm I've had experiences where I I quit things for\nFive years ago because I just couldn't take reading some of the things people are writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and you know say something I'd like to regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because\nIt was revealed on things but how I felt you know back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I I gotta say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair and he was good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned like you became I've learned not to say much about politics and\nThe ... when they know I'm On talk shows and if they know me already you good luck they'll never leave your law gets their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can see if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I Can't control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nIt had done some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media especially when we're finding out that they're you know so many things are hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on with mark\nAnd mark a a onto a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I our our list do a lot of charity or radio up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific they're worried that they\nYou know all the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians work\nAware that the U.S electorate we're going to do its best to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that or a fixed up that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and I'm\nAt a Charles Adler and and write and uh and and green or all of that probably helped a\nJet Obama or get a Trump elected because he was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that and uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years at a you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people for a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another change and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review social part it and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise]\nI think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is and he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI uh not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who's the red river in ... and\n... pretended that the you know they weren't as friends anymore you could see he was and you get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people come pick on Trump that for the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far on left he he really has got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike trouble then is a high bar I've got to admit that\nPlus saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him probably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar I've got a myth that uh people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in ... Illinois you're on was mark\nAnd mark I've got two observations and then have to make 'em to first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in it's always\nThe liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem the liberal friends [laughter] and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual\nNot the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in out for each individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country\nWhich specifically states that we have powers as individuals\nAnd not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\n... you said that in a very very well and by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in there so far out there than you know and they claim they're against fascism is example within ... but they're fascist themselves\nThey even when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so that yeah I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and\nThey they care about ... minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the ...

have a lot of private to customers what they do is they hired me privately [noise] so what I was doing was this guy was living in Calgary\nGuy says well look at when are you going to hope that the death will have a you can come out and look what I'm building come up for three months with Fifteen\nBuilding part of the car then I go back back to our we finish up shop and I'm just about to move my shop well isn't at the end [laughter] joke it's in all of a sudden a day later I get this email from saying\nI have just a just a\nJust found out that the Trump has been elected all you people from the all white all my friends are depressed and angry oh ... like a little windy windy session and he said I'm\nSo we cannot talk politics anymore and mind you this guy's been sixty grand putting a big huge ad\nIn the um the globe and mail for a for Trudeau back in Fifteen when he won so he's big to do guy meanwhile\nIs nothing good disabled Trump so we cannot talk politics I still moved here I was a little scared it was like there might do I still have the job so we can't even discuss politics anyone you know politics that means\nBut when I was younger and shifting everything was peachy because his sided one well now all of a sudden I didn't when I'm a you know what and I'm a bad guy and I'm In a little place called ... and the and there's it's the country here so if there's a few more conservative types here more Christians uh which I get along with just great\nUm but when you go into Vancouver since like Seattle it's the same thing you if I put my\nMega had in the back of my Seventy seven New Yorker ... all I could walk out I'll walk out at the bar with all my tires slash that's how we nasty they get here\nWell not just their than not just their here too I Would never put

taking my call a\nYeah I mean I I just wanted to call in and and say um well first of all proud to be an American and I'm a proud of my tuition and the fact that we're a country of laws and not of men um so but on the subject of Trump that\nThat it is kind of controversial or sometimes um you know uh nobody's perfect and we point out where people have lost them and I get into 'em for with both\nYou know uh nobody's perfect and we point out where people have lost them and I get until I'm ... from both sides of the Iowa here um but I'll be the first one to the tell all my relatives and friends that are the problem is not\nA secular branch the problem is a stark Congress and and the fact that um they block out a third parties consistently and so I think on the libertarians and the green to get together\nUnder one tent and help to break into the house so that we can have a work in government again I'm so that that's pretty much my bit ah\nYeah well I'll tell you that the libertarians agree that's a interesting conversation or a combination right there let's go to Terry in Johnstown, Pennsylvania you're on with mark\n... is our time here how're you doing\nA fine what I'm here [laughter] [noise]\nI was a bad law then or law will hurt the long war in Iraq and all that we can agree to work\nLaw over this law that can you do your job\nWhich I think he's doing very well we don't talk politics ... because they just start battle\nA supporter I'm concerned the learning curve all calling me calling everybody but war [noise] do you go out his blog the green\n[noise]\nAnd I appreciate that I think you're absolutely right let's go to Howard in New York City you're on with mark\n[laughter] I I just wanted to cover it for item is a way to prove about the Democrats the first one is one Obama when people didn't listen to what you get is number right away when he made a speech in Egypt in March of two thousand nine basically what he said in that speech was\nThe U.S was to blame for a lot of things instead of saying the U.S made some mistakes and ah we we we meant well but we didn't do what he was knocking the was it not getting it down like he was the enemy of the u._s. people and then he he uh\nHe uh didn't invite my beret the head of Egypt he lied to his enemy there so he go get him overthrown\nAnd and and Chuck Schumer in two thousand eleven locally said we got to do something about the first amendment\nUh here in New York you know because uh that but in two thousand and it didn't carry much weight because we want that liberal at that time we have to control it because people are saying bad things about a candidate and then the the third thing was we spend ...\nWhen when he went off and he went to a after the four people got killed the next day he when he was scheduled to go to raise money on the coast that he's still went and blame that on that this you know the thing and the and the one that he really shouldn't have gotten impeached for
