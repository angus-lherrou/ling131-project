I never picked up a golf club wants so am I going to be honest no one's gonna have not even sworn a golf and I got to make them in coming up yeah the independent Bob\nThe all by the way and it was sort of an independent Bob just called me a few times just ranting I Begin was on vacation he just ranting and raving ... Elizabeth Warren thing just sent him into outer space yeah he's just like this is just\nWell they they they believe that's a good thing to do\nThey believe that this is a good tactic you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left as using\nI mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file of the protesters talking about the people holding office yeah there are political\nTactics I mean there may this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe stuff like this was going to work\nAnd and that and you and I made sure that before he went on vacation when we're talking about cabinet not understand this is the mainstream now yeah all of the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying\nWell this isn't the average Democrat age the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate\nRight\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the train big problems\nThat she by the way that one narrow it down just to three to one of one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren a white person makes the claim yeah\nShe's Native American you all white privilege that's white privilege fried rice or cultural appropriation\nYeah right and and again they believe they're on the right track\nI Know it just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that though the polls everything else you've got a great show up for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the\nSouthern Sierra isn't southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that precept at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued couple regional highlights it will be warmer in the west no change in the chances for snow in the Northern Rockies it'll be drier and warmer\nA during the a committee vote on on on Capitol you know and that you had come out here is going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protest after the fact they still voted yet and they still voted\nSo there wasn't affected really anything you know it it will show about it but they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meeting will just get up and walk out\nThis is this ... this is a mainstream Democrats today this is not the protesters\nAnd we talked about how the protesters that lead the party they lead the party they leave the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's crazy and then then I guess the the\nThe other point was so Elizabeth Warren than does DNA matter\nRight\nDoes it does is destroyed transgender is ... ... if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the left just starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter]\nBefore this one of the leading liberal icons [noise]\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice worry rules and regulations ... number one you were saying the DNA matters dizzy and does so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the ...\nAcross the board that and then it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh that writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the\n[laughter] where does that decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop\nWell and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and\nPeople have you know forget about that because again what you know if that when a President Obama ... just before he left office I Believe that was the was the Atlanta for a New Yorker I forgot what I think was the Atlantic ... he did a a an interview with\nAnd they asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know they're ... mixed race soon and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct mhm it's what you think you are ... so is that it it now is that done now\nHas left moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent mhm\nEverything from cultural appropriation to the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science [laughter] ... [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up the science that's wrong but you see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the ... ... here's\nHere's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff mhm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just booming roller it's out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like bad hold my beer I think that the ball watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes naturally planets\nThat they were trying they're trying to prove him wrong on something that she didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty force of a second [laughter]\n\nMy my my favorite was the [laughter] Time Warner over one hundred and twenty fourth yeah maybe seal and it was a huge ... with a gun [laughter]\nWe're in in a swimming pool it's you know that that's it it really is the um that's the madness because they believe that something that's going to win\nFor them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat yeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both um\n[laughter]\nWe do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring down out but again you know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do to protest or type attitude but do they have up on stage you know we talked about this\nWith a few months ago we're talking about what the the the pool of contenders and the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have to top each other on how much they hate Trump\nThat will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you sort of the person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because\nNo longer can you have\nA debate\nNo longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering and as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no\nA jobs we need more jobs ... we have ... finding enough people right now I'm so in the what are you going to do well do you have it has to be up the hatred for Trump's so you're gonna have to display you know the one who hates them most is going to win\nOr where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free\nYeah yeah and then I mean ... and that we are the other\nDay we we're we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do we used to control\nA lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation\nOf of ah the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states would I by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response so we got from Democrats on this front where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we all know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the cars that by the way that gained ground overhear vacation than now the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to\nThe Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate exist that's why the electoral college or you know it exists because we're not in direct democracy were public\nOr constitutional Republican or public why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU used to care about right but now as we know they do right and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats ...\n... you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from Ocasio Cortez and kill him you know separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media asking them wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf you are Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty the it used to be the boiling\nThe frog slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go full on because you have Gillum and Florida promising to world Casio Cortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world\nFree stuff you've got to go full on because you have Gillum and Florida promising to world Casio\nCortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody I Know let let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright bright lights just give cash to people right and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college\nYeah and and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of 'em dead\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred thousand dollars\n[laughter] exactly or one ticket to the mega millions later this week [laughter] eight

you're going to have the party in power like the Republicans yeah they're going to lose seats right that's what that's what normally happens\nAh in in a case like this ah of course we live in unique times and every election is completely and totally unique I look at what the Republicans have right now\nThe uh Republicans have right now the economy\nRight the economy is doing the uh the economy's doing good uh\nAnd that is a huge you have the cabinet hearings where America has seen\nThat there are major major things that are important to many Americans that they now understand that the Democrats do not believe in and we talked about the cabin up and forget about the Supreme Court ordered showed was that depending on their politics\nThat the Democrats do not believe in a presumption of innocence right or the mindset of due process\nAnd we sort of back that you know at that time a few weeks ago so the look on we understand\nThat when it comes to a lot of things out there on there for example on the the ... of separation of powers and the three branches of government and the rights that are included in the first amendment to the constitution of the majority of Americans can't tell you what they are\nBut\nYou look at what is ingrained in our culture and one of the reasons is the ... the TV shows on lawyers all the way back to Perry Mason or the presumption of innocence and due process\nThe mindset of due process is ingrained into every single American so we saw that with Kavanaugh\nAnd we saw the reaction of\nMany people realizing that not the fringe of the Democratic

to and you said this earlier it's going to be\nEither who hates Trump more than a combination of who hates Trump more and we're going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats and Ben ... over the weekend air of last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in a ... of six thousand dollars is one of the figures I\nWas thrown out so now it's ... well on the braces income yeah first to get rid of the the tax cuts right the taxes would have\nTo go up there in order to pay for it even though they wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something like that what it was I I'm a but a ... is six thousand they're free healthcare completely Medicare per hour where you pay nothing\nThere's no deductible there is nothing mhm which ah by the way uh\nI thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said oh good screw with people that that right because what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all your interest going to enter screen all people because they're not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay ... right\nUh but uh you know the so you have you have that and free college him free college free health care\nFree money mhm and we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to go ahead we already know what twenty twenty is going to be yeah\nYep I age because there has to be again the that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more ... more or now will just kind of usher in this this thought and entertain this for a moment\nOkay\nMaybe it is Hillary or maybe it is Joe just anyone that can beat Trump\nExcept there has to be more than that there really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day\nIs oh what's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising and and do I have Trump I Know a lot of people have trumpet I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but\nAm I motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they going to do for me here talking about other people were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal going through Harlem and the than the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was\nJust you know random participants on the street interviews\nAnd the the one common thread in those and those respond is from his response was that he was talking about problems we have here at home\nShe kept talking about problems over seas somewhere\nOutside of this country as we said the reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was what the problems of war and and the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates sort of looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems that we have to solve them and that's how bad it had gotten by twenty six team as we said the Democrats were talking about and still are climate change and race are two major problem ... well they're not right Americans didn't view it that way right arm is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions that he has come up with\nOr that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not ... but the fact is he came up with the problems and identified the problems and politics are so bad in America today\n\nWhere if you just identified the problem in twenty sixteen that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nAnd then what you have now is two years later you got a ton of people looking at the same and you know something a lot of the solutions are the correct solution some\nYeah I mean that's in in that said it because what you have to deliver in order to be reelected for a second term\nIs results so if we're still looking at low unemployment\nAnd we're still looking at you know the people taking more money home because taxes are lower if we're still looking at a situation where the economy is getting better\nThen where\nDo you go you can offer free stuff what's that going to look like ultimately you're going to have to spell out how it's going to work\nUltimately you're gonna have to you know I mean\nWe say what you will about Herman Cain's nine nine nine plan but guess what people still say the the name of the plan now we torn apart and it didn't work and ultimately didn't work for him but the point is is that you come out with something very simple here's how my plan is going to work\nHere's what I Want to do while you're up against potentially a president in twenty twenty who has delivered some pretty stellar results on the economy\nSo you're gonna do what promised a lot of free stuff do people still buy the hype in the free stuff if they believe that will never be delivered ultimately\nAnd because here's what changed after the break procession and we saw this it was well the banks got the bail out so I should get\nIt was well the banks got the bail out so I should get mine even people that otherwise might be conservative you know we're like okay we want we do want more free stuff we got a ton of those calls and and so there is that affect their but the concern is too is that\nAmongst the you know just the generic voter population out their rank and file voter\nThey're looking at as a this big promise oh free health care for everybody free whatever it's going to be the big free package and they say to themselves you know what it will be free for somebody else and it won't be free from me\nThey they compare themselves to their neighbor or somebody else and it's like now I just got to end this good economy I just got to making this amount of money and guess what they're promising something to somebody else I'm not going to get any of that [noise] your calls and comments coming up eight six six\nNinety right I Want to have sex acts on red

America we love America\nWondering I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may love the concept of what you as a group all think America shouldn't be\nBut you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have you and I've talked about it when you talk about the fact now there's they're talking about well the president needs a member of the presidency\nIs no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go from what they don't understand it those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are as to protect the rights of the minority best\nTo protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claimed that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I've always got response or it's above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting ... what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution oh yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time\nBut it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we've broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nAnd we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activist judges and how bad is on American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm\nAnd so the average person I think she is at and Trump is anything they look at Trump and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist even at times though his words we like it don't say that\nYeah I ... when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes and the lawyer on it's all constitutional\nYes it's all part of the process that was put in place hundreds of years ago\nI mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is what it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate we need to get rid of it and we're not going to win the electoral college vote\nThen you can really get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution wanted Dustin when it does or run me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the president's that's anti American yes\nNo it's not well what America for ... it's not America we don't like the constitution if we don't have the form of government that we have that it's no longer America what do you believe in\nBesides the Fifth Amendment [laughter]\nBesides that exactly an eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWhat are you ready to do with a record every month\nExactly and the eight six six Ninety read I\nRead a book written record every might\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell road tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shoveled tell us what matters is inside\nThere's not much pointed driving a fuel efficient truck if you have to give up everything that makes driving a truck great so step up to the extreme efficiency of the western start fifty seven hundred ... and get your top back\nThe fifty seven hundred actually combines western stars extreme heritage with dinosaurs advanced engineering to significantly improve the efficiency dependability in profitability\nFind out everything that makes the fifty seven hundred acts the awesome from your nearest dealer who you can find at western star dot com\nHave your driving right now and you'd like to read the informative and entertaining content found in the current September October issue of rotating magazine or if you'd like to listen that's why I said listen\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of vote your drivers is now available for free as an F.

today there's a couple systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure system and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the\nSouthern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued couple regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow in the Northern Rockies it'll be drier and warmer\nLindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican I'm committed to get up and do what come out with Harris did you know after the committee will get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know but I'll Wait wait a minute and again you can't make the case ... he was trying to make the case but it was the same and I'm like no was unprecedented what happened right [laughter] you you can look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed and I believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him\nYes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe it was a Democrat Senate at the time\n[noise] yeah\nUh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented\nNot being with nothing we've ever seen a ... in our lifetime or in modern times\nHas has been like this so do even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity of means\nA lack of knowledge ah on\nOn history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen was sort of more on that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower\nTo cell tower case or the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in there\nOn the with the cell tower right the cell tower case of the cell tower that they agreed with Gorsuch should they you know that ah they used the in their writings they used 'em\nA prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is ... exactly that was the press and the right to use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate which is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do not\nBy what we want each and every day mhm mhm ... what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we should look ... you know conservatives and Republicans stop have to stop\nArguing the same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republican I keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ...\nI'm not voting for a conservative judge\nI'm voting for a construction is an originalist\nI'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be teaching everyday understand that their role is not to make law either left or right there their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says you\nKnow it's interesting to as ... as we got to the uh the the closer to the the\nUltimate vote on on a cabin on you know I made the point that even the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at\nOne judgment you can look at from SCOTUS was recess appointments which was unanimous yeah against all by him against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear\nOn what the process yes and so respecting not only in the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe and you know you can\nSay what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or\nOr whether they're descending or majority opinion you can we can turtles apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with\nThis or that but in terms of the process I think ah by and large I have seen them display consistently respect for the actual process\nAnd I can point to that one example but there are others a recess appointments was that unanimous decision where\nLook you can't do that and and and that is that is the difference when the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect to process what is left because what is left is shouting people out of restaurants\nDo away with the Senate do away with this do away with the President's Day do away with the electoral college do away with parts of the constitution\nThat's what's left\nTo

we're we're we're that goes I started thinking so this judge\nIs saying that\nState Department officials lied and sign clearly false affidavits [noise]\n\nAh does that mean that it doesn't mean anything 'cause we're we're ... because I I Know the state department but I started thinking that\nThat\nIn the Obama administration did they really think if this is true and if it's true what we think is going\n... absolutely there should have been but the Democrats have no business of talk after all the Democrats in the media backed up Hillary Clinton's line about a terrorist attack that got Americans killed and they lied about it\nYes and she knew about it and I believe the White House and President Obama knew that they were lying about it why there was an election coming up so they lie about it a terrorist attack on that killed American citizens and an American ambassador and they lied about it and one we discovered\nThat the evidence existed that Hillary lied about it remember when Jim Jordan\nBrought it out what was the response of the media that day\n\nThis was a great week one of Hillary as best we up this was a great week for Hillary and she'd be the hearing showed she didn't break any law well because we're looking for a law breaking the law and that was it you know you had Shepard Smith on Fox News well she's not going to jail and she I mean\nThere's no this wasn't about what that is is that that whole false premise idea\nThey ... they did because you know a liberal like a chef Smith once you want to paint this picture of the audience or to the audience that this was some kind of trial it was not it was it was a hearing to get to the truth\nShe would never have been prosecuted there was never even anybody calling for her to be prosecuted or on the

Washington Examiner a as late Sunday evening posted some of the supporters are lining up for blocks one day before the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early Sunday\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell 'em those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolated out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between how they use those now if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure as being done by the campaigns you would have the better you know a better guess at that right\nYeah it it gets here it is a a a dentist midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released this Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the G O P the seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap that Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk of likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and as we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLeading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you what's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the rice is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I'll I'll watch it on the my call before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because\nMy was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian\nCollusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we started talking about I think that's important\nBecause I don't find many people like Mike mhm\nI don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to mankind and we do think that we have looked at it more or as investigators and partisan\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warrant and and and everything there that we are going to find out that probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dream didn't of actually doing as we know already\nThe only evidence of colluding with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to giving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his\nSalacious on verified information or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um it could it is\nIt an underlying factor as a part of the large\nNo it really isn't um\nIt could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but\nIt could be there and that again is that underlying motivator\nThat's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotionally right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they've been alleging all of this since you know a after the election and since certainly has become president\nUh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's like you are now I don't I don't see it I look\nI think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference in keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion right for the mall or investigation at all but not\nAnd see I don't know what a a a ... report does the if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the midterm\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't put out a report I don't think they do it's it's an incomplete um what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that and and that's that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump looting with the Russians\nI I just because where where it would be the evidence if there's not going to be in the movement on an ... if it is just to report a crystal isn't over its CNN\nOr former Washington Post I write that you know where he said you know I think it's a it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just going to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge\nSomewhere else along the lines and and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing ...\nProbably will never see this ... right because in and that will be a complete dud that it'll just happening right it's it's not a delight to be done the last two years you had accusations gone just\nIs except for the fact\nThat you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz\nAnd we've been asking this ... I still haven't seen anybody else asked what ... what we asked why would the White House sent it to the inspector general but we're talking about the\nBad as the ... that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking is asking the question what do you start out by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said why she sent it into the ... the only reason you some of the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this why is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen brand and people have just to refresh un rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify\nUh the Pfizer application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice for almost a Twenty one different pages or and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies that don't want us to ah you know release it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it and\nExpedite whatever that I'm at heart yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I.
