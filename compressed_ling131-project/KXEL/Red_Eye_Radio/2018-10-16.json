high\nPosition in her corporation [noise]\nI'm sure there is more detailed than that you're saying there's a new California state law mandates a certain percentage of of what women in the upper ranks of corporate management\n... they have to hire them yes he brown signed into law\nTowel and have to look into the uh the details of that is the fact that it's a new California law obviously there would be some uh some numbers involved so I'll I'll look into that [laughter] All right Dave and fond du Lac Wisconsin on the ... and Joe hello\nDave oh Jim how you doing this evening fine thank you\nYeah I just want to call up and and say that uh you know I agree with you one hundred percent and ended up being rest mitigation and any executive that has taken any type of training is taught to mitigate\nAny any rest myself personally I work in a factory\nAnd I don't have the opportunity to work around a whole lot of women but when I Do you know you're kind of tend to go out and sent out feelers walk on eggshells for a little while to see I Want to say what you can get away with but being where where's the relationship or where to go\nUm\nAs far as you know what what what was able to be discussed and everybody is is okay with that\nOf\nThe trouble is today I'm not sure that everybody is okay with much of anything\nNo they're not everybody is really too sensitive about things they need to put on the big boy bands and just go and get a job done\nWell that would certainly be a step in the right direction not likely to happen I suspect anytime soon Dave [noise] I I found that the particular law that uh that we are talking about here in California\nCalifornia in the law says that every publicly traded company in California must have at least one woman on the board of directors or face a heavy financial penalty [noise] now than uh\nI I doubt very seriously the laws constitutional\nBut we'll see if in fact anybody cares to push it far enough it made it to the Supreme Court I suspected it would be tossed out of out of out of bounds of course putting a woman on the board of directors\nIs not the same thing as the the the standard hiring process and in particular we're talking about the problem of hiring executive assistant to work closely\nWith say a chief executive officer that's where the problem seems to reside [noise]\nUh so it is similar to what we're talking about but I suspect not a lot to directly so one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the cliff in the champagne Illinois next pillow cliff\nYes I can take my call yesterday at a comet or to make about the what you might call the uh Billy Graham mentality of\nA man being cautious and their interactions with women like Mike Pence was accused of that a while back up being so cautious about ... ... have lunch together or live it hard to get to that sort of thing\nWithout is why the president yeah so that's\nWhere I live that exactly I say a great deal of wisdom of that on on care very distinct fun is one of all the second well almost all of the second one if you will is that just to avoid that possibility of an\nUnfounded accusations if it's just me and her and the car she could say was ever a few aunts and I'm as guilty by by default in the same as as a Kavanaugh found out so painfully hadn't ... a week but the number one reason I think is that\nJust to avoid the possibility avoid the temptation of a situation I\nKnow you hear stories of guys have gotten in trouble with a girl in the hotel room and it just always so I don't know how he got there we didn't really intended that we were just on a business trip and we just had dinner and but just for a walk to a room separately and we just\nUp together by advise that kind of situation just avoid the very first step down the slippery slope and don't have their their together don't have the business trip together all the odd situation out light\nYeah but of course if you do that you have affected Lee eliminated women from a a let's say physician such as executive assistant you can't be an executive assistant to a corporate president without doing just that I mean you you wouldn't even be effective and the role you've got to work closely with them\nSo right off of that you are taking a category of work which is an entry level to upper management for many people and they're essentially saying no women there I mean that that's what we're talking about\nThis and in that sense it is a an unfortunate unintended I'm sure side effect of the hall me too movement is that guy is just have to be cautious to this type of situation our eyes and\nIt it does seem I must I must confess thank you for your thoughts cliffs to John and Susan bill California have a show hello\nCan believe I'm fine how are you know I Believe you are on watch a lot of you but go ahead\nWell ancient history but it still bothers me today especially while listening to radio and I ... a lot about Cabot out they will say\nI'm having to defend themselves against false accusations in that same situation were to go back and allow Lenny seven I'm sixty six year old now or at the time I was just a hard working guy was your ambitious and uh\nI

business and basically live out all my games\nAre saying that but she offered you financial help an exchange for sexual favors I'm just trying to I guess you\nKnow well it's hard to say uh\nWell about an hour and I want to break any way here so uh why don't you think about that I'm not trying to put words in your mouth but I'm trying to to understand so stand by and we'll continue our discussion

everybody in this country grew up\nWith that with that viewpoint but that obviously is the lesson for today\nYes I agree with you all that but I'm just talking the reality is that when you got young

R. at AOL dot com and ah I'm spoiled on my network other networks show people are already calling me for say anything so feel free to do that you don't always have to wait [noise]\nLast night we talked about if you didn't hear it and we talked about the civil war we're now experiencing in this country between the left and the right in my opinion for the soul of our country\nWe also talked about how justice Kevin are hearings were really not about his qualifications but a continuation of that battle when when you understand that\nIt puts it a little bit prospect that didn't matter who President Trump was going to nominate and they were against them in fact if if you remember the placards of the protesters I don't even think they had a name on it I don't know if they had an ex or what they have\nBut it didn't matter it was all about making sure that the president couldn't appoint a ... his choice let alone a conservative\nAnd the chief aim of that battle is removed President Trump from office\nThe left and the Democrats and the media\nThat's all the same as I've pointed out before never accepted his victory\nAnd they're doing everything possible to undermine that seems pretty obvious so in this segment I Want to talk about what I said this last night what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office despite the best efforts of the left\nAnd I've set for months now I could care less about what he says and much more than what he does and in fact that I guess it makes me behavior list that's how I feel about people you know they they may say awful things about you or to others but if they treat you well\nI think that's what kills now his tweets of not always helped and he's answered people shouldn't that seems obvious to me and engage with people beneath his position to his detriment I don't think he gets that that certain people that's what I Do and I think I'm right I Know are people that aren't worth my time well what's the point you're not going to get anywhere anyway\nPoliticians typically talked our officers that's not a big deal you talk to them may have talked to the Russians including Obama to remember Obama promised\n... typically talked are officers that's not a big deal talks than we've talked to the Russians including a bomb and they remember Obama promising off Mike though things will be better when he got re elected but he you know make more stuff happened\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\n... should have made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened ... did you hear that he threatened them as they help their bosses conduct oversight and just as disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct almost nonchalant attitude about corruption in his agency that amazed me\nThis is all gotten way out of hand and it was clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest the lawns of our government at the Justice Department and the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles was my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWe're we're never supposed to find out about this subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win\nRight her champagne and our celebration there was a big boat celebration is supposed to happen in New York City\nThere were waiting for her match the only one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that and all of that would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nThe swamp must be drained by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again\nIt's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know when you think it's time to free the American people from this structure\nIt is time to free all the defendant smaller so far named in this witch hunt like Michael Flynn that never should have happened he didn't even know he was being under investigation and I'll take the time it's all part of the resistance and it's got it and\nLet me tell ya and I I Want to go on but I Want to get your calls when I thought about President Obama will we never did what these people did so let me know what you think\nEight six six Ninety red eye eight six six same thing nine o seven thirty three thirty nine it's mark gosh they're filling in on right on the radio [noise]\nBush ... or ... ... ...

Virginia you're on with mark\nHijack they mark how ya doing real well how you doing\nOh Virginia you're on with mark\nHijack they mark hey how you doing real well how you do\nA good point I just wanted to make is that you mentioned about all the good that a\nHundred and she was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem are recognizing conservative values of a nation of laws with one of the build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings I think a lot of times we can see the uh the recent\nInterview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting for these conservative values appointees Supreme Court justice is like you were a note in about a course touching a\nKavanaugh what is something that uh you would think would be something that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out\nYou know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her\nHer personal server and breaking that sort of a security well in that regard being part of the deep state having someone was something that you see you might come up to be the next battle that he's going to fight and the and the upcoming election\nWell I'll tell you what's going to be the next battle on off you heard last night we may very well I Hope we don't and people were cheering me up last night and I tend to be an optimist that we might lose the house 'cause every race stands on and so on and I know some reasons here in California that I never thought would happen like Dana Rohrabacher I mention his name and I know him\nAnd he's in trouble because they're spending millions of dollars so if the Democrats take back the house Jake you're gonna see hearing you're going to see subpoenas you want to see the attempt to impeach President Trump and Kevin off and make these next two years worse than the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that's the biggest fear I have\nAnd we got to be very careful great call thanks so much Jake\nAnd now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nWe've seen the past couple of nights some freezing rain in the area of western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain has moved off to the east\nAnd warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those will extend through the architecture region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael not necessarily going to be associated with any rain from the front but\nThe justice system and I have to wonder that\nWell the way you talk about later probably well I'm very disappointed and Jeff Sessions he showed no guts no no ah for for us what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in his position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who do who give their life up\nFor them or she is and care what what you did the\nYeah and then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond or despicable or she or he puts it a deplorable a you know it it it it's\nYou have to be totally blind or just totally ignorant of the fact that I mean do you look back\nAnd look how far this country's fall in eight years we had we had a leader previous ... presidents so called president take this country down and I believe we set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years or ... but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that the what was the guy's name and then the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden that the U.S to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he sent it back and a lot of people who voted for him because he was black think hey we're going to show we're not race and so on and yet he he update and you're right it's worse now the the animosity in this country is is worse than he was president\nAnd you know the the most is\nSo now the animosity in this country is is more since he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown in Ferguson was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history as the events happened as everything went down\nHe walked into as I recall to convene a convenience store he pushed the owner around the store or the Senate and the store and not be attended down walked out with a bunch of goodies and then one on down the middle of the street looking for trouble a guy was wired for sound\nSo mine are it only as yeah yeah I Know my elderly lady\nJust said it was the way the police officers somebody look you are right on all counts and rubber Obama who is that I don't know how many days before the election saying we're going to fundamentally change this country have a friend on radio who said measure of you sent your wife when we get married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president\nAnd then at the end of the day as far as the person is so that\nIt didn't take very long for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about ... odd Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and\nAl Charlotte and it didn't take on what was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson ... to ... to ... to stir up the eight and discontent as usual and you know what the amazing part of it was as they grow\nThat Michael Brown and gone into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nYou know you better\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is a credible and it needs to stop\nBut they kept talking and driving home all this crap and and it's nothing more than a damn smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd Pete I Want to have there are those said he treated a point that I think is very good on your side the less just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing writes the the collusion with the Russians and what what do we wait two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get on the global warming that right although uh it became climate change\nAlways from ... crisis in the world is falling apart but as you said you've got a president now who's not letting him get away with is in fact my love what he said to the minority community he said what do you have to think about what's been going on in the last twenty thirty forty years\nAnd you know mark ... another thing I knew he was going to win\nThat election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope people listening will agree with us I mean maybe I Am wrong I've been known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of them smoke them off the stage basically well\nAnd there was this guy has\nSold basic political affiliations aid had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people the respect the fact that finally you got somebody who didn't care about how he came across just said what are your thoughts\nOver the top sometimes you know I Wish he didn't say some things on you know write songs on Twitter that he does\nAnd I wish you ... I said that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package and as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I just gave a partial list and far better than George W. Bush\nAnd in certain ways they compete to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he's he's done so much he doesn't get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done\nAnd as I said I don't care what he says I care what he does you know ... I'm just thinking about a on a personal ... what kind of surgeon do you want someone does a great job for you or someone I you know has a great disposition ideally you want both but because it's been terrific in office and\nI think he's grown into an even better than I expected\nUm and here's someone else who agrees but I go to disagree to Marcus in broad run Virginia Iran with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm here thank you mark\nAnd um [noise] I agree with your last caller and President Trump did not need this mess he did not needed all he was already a\nBillionaire he was going to lead us he could have sat there and and not worried about anything\nHe worried about the people of this country and their direction this country we're going\nWe're going down a socialist path they were going down where you are going down\nSo long path\nAnd he told us out he grabbed us and told us out\nAnd do left is going crazy right ...\nHe is right when he goes to the uh [noise] you know campaign tiring [noise] what he is talking\nIs an absolute truth look I grew up in\nA democratic [noise] household I mean lifelong Democrats [laughter] only time my mother which was\nWhere she voted for Nixon back in the ... because of anarchy that's going on and now we've got an arc here again [noise] all I can [noise]\nYou know capitalism socialism good I got kids in college that agree with socialism\nThat year than last year in college now is Adam ... good capitalism is bad and we have to change the system [noise]\nHey we're not racist country we elected Donald Trump I go to a black church I'm a white man\nYou know and\nReally the Bible teacher the preacher and his wife and most of the other you know or or Democrats well they're all Democrats okay [noise] we got one of the brain God\n[noise] where\nI was just going to say I appreciate your call just because we are going to the break but a ... you know I even love his style ...

I was going to mention we didn't get that yet you know Stormy Daniels a lost and he he's a lawyer and he brought out the sweat and a girl I Can't even as that's her name\nAnd she thought what did she accused him of a you know they were part of this gang rape or at least that they were there and it was so officers they actually hurt the case then the other ... case for its case against the judge Kavanaugh because it you start getting ridiculous accusations so\nUh that's how it ended in ... for those who didn't hear it on the answer is you you can't in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and you there was no cooperating evidence against the judge and that's that's the way he does sometimes she you know when you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her saying I Can't understand\nOh cooperating evidence against the judge and that's that's the way it goes sometimes you you know when you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her saying I Can't understand how you guys like President Trump and they're trying to narrow down and find out what she didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that there was Russian collusion but there's been no evidence of that\nAnd I'm going to predict now or the mall is not going to come up with anything on colors and the only thing left now is obstruction of justice and even that doesn't seem likely and then she you know she mentioned the thing I Wish I had er on to you know but I think I'm expressing it pretty well\nThat of all the people around him that we're a guilty and something to a collision but they weren't they had nothing to do with collusion\nWas Michael Flynn horror Manafort there was other stuff in this case isn't really agree just because\nThe FBI interviews him he doesn't even have a lawyer with him and they get them on line to the FBI which is a great point I Would never\nPick on her but the point I was going to make as many people say they go into psychology

Bush called for\nA some kind of a new immigration bill to clean up some of the mess that can be left back in the sixties\nWe essentially had an ad in the uh any immigration reform to speak out from that time and the Congress and drag their feet and ... on on this thing until actually ask her bra Obama had already been elected louder ended in two thousand and eight\nAt the last minute in December or the lame duck Congress passed and immigration reform act\nAnd as it went through community and they in the weeks prior they just kept piling now more and more garbage into this thing you George Bush signed this thing it was either eight hundred twelve hundred pages already being tired but [noise]\nI and I read all the documentation that goes with dieting find started slipping dinner section too overweight somewhere maybe a ... bill or the problem is that we have now they've created so many of the problems that we have now\nAnd what it is is they can't just automatically send these kids back they can send their parents back up prior to the passage of this legislation a bear in mind I live in the town where we train most of the border patrol people okay\nThe federal law enforcement training centers right here where I live so I take great interest and all this stuff in in the past prior to that two thousand and eight bill almost everybody who came to the border and made any kind of claim a this island or anything like that\nThe border patrol agent on a grandparent his supervisor and in extreme cases the supervisor above that supervisor made the determination\nWhether or not that person got to state it was never part to two thousand and eight issue Jeter Keisha from the started or training or it could become involved with [noise]\nSo George most scientists are as a lame duck leaving and you may remember George W voice was very soft on immigration I don't think he specifically like this legislation [noise]\nWhat do you think it was better than what the ad part to that that circle certainly accomplished many of his goals\nAre ... are still way up this country tomorrow ... so that means sad uh the regulatory environment that came out of that are out of that bill created all this stuff that we've had now since two thousand and eight\nSo for ten years we've been dealing with is the only way it's probably going to get solved is for the courts to recognize that not everything is for education that are at some point they're going to have to take the spirit of the law rather than our own individual feeling too well", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "16"}
