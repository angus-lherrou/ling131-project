there'll be a close but it'll be more than a ... vote majority\nThe ironic thing about him too I just want to point out we've when Jeff Flake of all the people is it when I look back\nAs I got a long memory I'm back in ... and these are category like you are than I still remember a Nineteen Ninety One and hearing the words on the Senate floor that man is innocent until proven guilty what we had was not a hearing about a trial\nAnd then this trial there was not enough evidence so I'm voting for him to support that Clarence Thomas and that was none other than\nDemocrat Dennis deacon see any of Arizona who Jeff Flake replaced\nA that's a that is true you do have a good memory and so we'll forgive the fact that you are I gather one of those old white men who are evil and that never to be trusted died one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five four six to six and yes it is true that this was not a court of law\nSo technically the presumption of innocence was not apply but in practice it has and it should to Randy and crushed in Iowa good evening Randy\nHi Jeremiah just to call you I I'm a product of the eighties and I just am concerned with Kevin out what he says he he never blacked out I don't I don't have a problem with\nAnybody that had they drank in the eighties everybody\nBut when he says well here's ... says that he did not ever blackout and I disagree I think that was a boy so why why and that that's where I have a big problem we'll ask him holding a higher court you're like\nWell I used to I used to drink a lot of them are blacked out either I I I drank too much and there were times when I should have stopped and frankly these days I hardly ever drink at all\nI may be in this calendar year in October I maybe had maybe eight or nine drinks this entire year but uh I drank too much and I didn't like the idea that if you drink at all regularly that you automatically blackout is simply not true\nWell I don't know what I'm\nSaying if you drink here is not true but when he says there's so many people that say the ad time just to find that hard to believe and I\nMean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he is he drank more than he should have but of course the real issue here is not whether or not he at one time ESPN blacked out\nA better than of itself is not what's at issue here the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody I mean for example I uh I I drank too much of an occasion but it's sort of didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\nLose interest in the world you know\nHe's never been interested in the bank has acted so I certainly understand that but when I sat on a college student in Haiti I find that hard to believe\nAs well as those are the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such a again a even if they they\nThere's no reason to either the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer a blackout says such\nA again a even if they they drank more than they should have there are gradations of drinking and they do not to my mind constitute an issue of uh of confidence to hold disposition especially for someone who today apparently a drinks very responsibly so\nTo me that's that's not the issue here the issue is the credibility of the sexual assault charges\nMore to come on eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six on double headed show as the FBI is doing they're interviewing the

okay and you're talking about an action that occurred let's say in the year uh Nineteen Ninety eight\nWell that that changing the law doesn't affect that crime a yes all crime subsequent to twenty twelve and that law was passed now suddenly have no statute of limitations but if you did a certain bad thing\nBefore twenty twelve [noise] it has no statute of limitations you cannot make a law that applies to things that happened before the law was passed so that statute of limitations for a Brett Kavanaugh even assuming that he did what he's accused of doing a would would still not apply\nYeah and the other thing too I don't know why a lot of people don't understand or surprised by this whole thing because then we see something like this happen in the United states wants before\n[noise] I well I mean there were certainly there were charges were brought against Clarence Thomas before his Supreme Court confirmation that consisted from uh from one person of course\nNot not all of a

unsubstantiated on they have no ... while they may have merit to her\nBut there's no proof I mean there's like show underwear showing with our society who are guilty before we are presumed innocent\nWell again some people to keep in mind here from a purely legal point of view Dave and that would be that the presumption of innocence technically legally only applies in a court of law\nOr the presumption of innocence as as a matter of general practice usually applied before a congressional hearings\nBut it does not apply a as a a the more than a usual practice there is no presumption of innocence\nBefore a a a a congressional hearing in this sort of thing and and you you you do not have a again because we're talking about elevating someone to a privilege it you do not have a right

WMA al WABC where all the media you know where where where they are located and we know a ton of you listen and you all know what NBC did\nWas a complete hack job that is in journalism an allegation any self without anything else to cooperate it\nIs not a story it's not a story that a manger that a major newspaper or a major TV network should ever run it lacks completely on any type of journalism ethics and\nThey know it had that been someone claiming that about Obama in two thousand eight that it never would have noted that will what will you know it's coming out now is the leaks are completely anonymous\nYeah right there was another one uh ... completely a of a of anonymous people are just sending letters hey I was abused right and then that's being like oh this is another lettering from somebody else have you paid attention of social media\nYou can make these people don't even use her real name on social media most often I mean it just and\nAnd it's to me it it shows you know that\nNBC don't ever\nEver complain about President Trump using the term fake news and directing it at you right if you put out that kind of peace trash story yeah based on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in\nKind of peace I trashed story yeah based on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in there\nThat this person is walking back everything\nThat they say and you can't find anybody\nTo cooperate it you don't do with that story it's the same thing as I mentioned from I heard that was we talked about yesterday\nFrom Arab Brady at USA Today and\nWhen he wrote well should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done\nAnd then talked about in his original article a credible source by the way just the un out as I said on yesterday show I I Know Eric Brady I'm was used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know that it's important see that's what you do in your blood people know that [noise]\n'cause somebody might find out in and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young\nAnd you know we've kept in in touch over the years just on Facebook\nOr which is a space his Facebook vows to lead it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim it as a news story not an opinion that credible evidence there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh\nIt's a ... and and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it has hit home with me\nThey are never going to get off the break here\nNo no this is and and it won't end when Trump was no longer president this is not going to end no because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls him out\nThe next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating it they admit they can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nA story on the ... this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memos released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now hit if Mitchell had reported that my finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court\nThat would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News but right now if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news\nIs that an all time low\nThat's it\nNobody believes you and I see right through you\n\nYour tax nothing more nothing less and it's shameful behavior yes oh stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right you're not even worthy of his recognition frankly because\nYou're nothing if you're going to put somebody out there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo which is part of the official process from the prosecutor gets zero time\nYes we don't feel that the president should stoop to your level\nRight that'll really took them off well and that's and that's what it's that's breed and that by the way coming from a guy who ... who has how many times we sat on this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the\nHis Twitter account way for a few minutes and and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively where he says something that totally doesn't work it communications from this White House have been horrible but that's how bad and the NBC but it's all you don't or you shut it you have an earned a writer for him because\nIt's also what you get from the left that well because of this president and there were changing the way that we do thing yeah we haven't no women shall we don't care who looks like we have communication we we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton [laughter] what whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain ... and up to ... any it's over and I can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do\nAnd no they go out on their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody and that they themselves as a news organization can't backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell or a release the memo was part of the official process\nThey could take it and take it to another prosecutor and asked that prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr forge claims and would you say the same thing the memo did\nNot even that they completely skirted the entire thing\nAnd then you're going to have all these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News and trying to think what's going wrong our origins going well what's what's what's the problem here\nBut well it's interesting because one of the one of the other stories that came out during the day on Monday is that you have the founder of CNN Ted Turner that says the idea that it has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left\nAnd as the founder of the network and then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at a uh Greenfield Jeff Greenfield death or who ran CNN for years comes out and says\nThe people that work at CNN thinks that they're part of our act as if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump\nResistance ... we know this we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know bear before\nThat can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it's so not journalists they instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a there they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis\nThat's a new word for opinion right opinion at the top\nYeah but opinion should be based on some well see that's why your hand analysis\nShould be here's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion\nSo if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what the cats are already out of the bad people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows are at the bottom of the cable news and NBC's at the bottom of the network news\nIt's not Trump inch you yep eight six six Ninety read I\nWas already my favorite

situation to be in would anybody want to I wouldn't want to be a message nothing\nNo no\nEspecially with the bills that have to come do over the next ten years when you're talking about the millions and you're making thirty what something thousand a year yeah\nRight it's\nTime to ration your comment but no we we don't want to do that we don't want to control our spent\n\nA I guess then that everything is settled in ... there is this just lost completely this this wasn't a part of the news whatsoever right but the president had to agree with all the spending bills with no additional funding for\nAnywhere I mean you we had at one point two trillion to the debt so that didn't happen you know that's oh wait a minute no no no no no if this is Obama's economy it also has to be Obama's debt right now [laughter] ... [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I guess I'm going to say we're all we're all in this big part of that got are now\n[laughter] [noise] well I mean think about it if if Republicans\nAre because remember the it's the it's the deficit this year that's going to skyrocket through the roof yes to over a trillion dollars in one year and we're not at war no it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not into recession throwing seven hundred a ... billion dollars at a banks or\nAny of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats were able to take over both\nUh the Senate and the house and what would there never will move the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats want\n\nIf they're Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunken sailors but at least a drunken sailor ... Ohio was rated they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking fender they throw out ice on anybody got it all relates doesn't it uh\nBut how much would Democrats ... Republicans are are spending this much and and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care 'cause there's no political pressure this will continue\nAs I said this is this is my the twenty ninth anniversary or this week of doing talk radio uh the first issue that we had which was back in eighty nine\nWas the whole clean sweep that Congress will spending too much money and it's time for a clean sweep and monarch forget the protests all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was four trillion or less ...\nMaybe even three I care don't even remember what it was at that point but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets about the debt [laughter] [noise] yeah like today something I'm are marching in areas where\nDo you guys marching for the debt who's that national debt oh\nBy the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh uh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar you know last year from the federal every working American\nYou can find a way every working American uh uh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred\nDollar you know last year from the federal every working American the the debts that basically as it is split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf but remember\nIn the tax bill last year mhm\nOnly the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes are people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up yes\nBecause working norm is Lee wealthy exactly that's why ... ... as the one caller said a couple of years ago billion ... billion areas which was a surprise to all of us just keep it up\nI'll tell you this if I was a billionaire ... I'd get rid of the my Fifteen year old vehicle that has two hundred and ten thousand\nModel oh yeah yeah yeah no I put that out what the trash [laughter] it would be gone my butler would\nI Would but because of certain business ... we both share a we can't take them anymore and therefore our ... our businesses did matter [laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset that we are actually looked at the tax by the taxing was right thing to do is we evolved in state of before\nA irrespective of the unfairness towards us other problems double spending\nA and and that's what it comes down to the weakening because the the the fiscal policy uh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while all over the place especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially\nBut beyond that the fiscal policy\nBecome something very different because and this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides this\nWill start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America and start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on a this program this federal program and yours your child's school\nNo go start taking things away that's when people start getting motivated that's when they start paying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't\nBe able to tell you the majority of them are they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out and you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not walk\nThere is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending and a number of issues that conservatives are watching and had been watching forever and are important because they've always been important\nBut this is it an Obamacare as one of those\nYou know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something that somebody else was going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one ... in California well we'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for that's why\nEven though you have when you had Jake Tapper CNN and and even Chris Cuomo\nQuestioning a K C O Cortez reality and Gail I'm In Florida and and and Gillum about the you know the ... of Medicare for all ... they understand what we're spending right now how do you pay ... already going to be a trillion dollars in debt how do you pay you can't pay for all ... and pay for what we're paying\nFor today it's impossible so the only thing you can do is put massive debt\nOn the uh on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up and how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much an interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially at every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know mid to late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens but as we've said is immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolute immoral and unethical\nTo be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stated before\nWe found a loophole of taxation without representation we found a loophole your tax\nThe future they didn't vote for it they had no representation they had no say in it they're completely innocent and all of this and we found the most moral way and we just hide our heads in the stands sand let's put it\nOn them and because I said that I expect to get the emails today which\nI always get whenever I said that oh you're exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in control in debt is all part of it\n... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience by writing those emails well\nBecause it effectively when it gets to the point that you can even service the interest on the debt as a nation the massive hit to the economy when our global trade partners can no longer trust the U.S\nIt will be catastrophic in nature to say well we can just write it off on paper and start over nope no you can't\nBecause no one is going to trust doing business with you any longer and when that happens then are great show great grandchildren and their children and great grandchildren\nWill not experience\nOr what the expansion of wealth\nAnd the freedom and liberty it brings to their family they won't experience that 'cause they only play there is going to have the government the federal government taking over more industry nationalizing industry eight six six\nNinety read I was told that success he wrote a [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered to joined the
