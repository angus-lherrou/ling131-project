last couple of hours the ah ten pm a National Hurricane center\nOr update chose it now at a what a hundred and twenty five miles an hour the winds right and expected to be right now over a hundred and thirty which would make it at least a category for hurricane that with a hit the um pan handle Gulf\nCoast right they're they're talking about the storm surge being a ... a really strong strong surgeon and talking about how the the potential uh for a life threatening conditions is really great with this storm\nA everyone in this area needs to heed the warnings and and listen to officials and and those directives given by officials are in the coming hours if you haven't already because\nAh you see the pictures and videos of the people in that area and uh I'm getting ready evacuating boarding up windows and everything else this is a major storm already and has\nThe potential to be a and and most believe it will be a historic storm\nA in terms of the damage and the size of the storm\nOr it will then move inland with a ton of rainfall we were talking during the pre show meeting\nAs it moves through uh the uh the the panhandle of Florida and then goes into north north easterly direction toward the Carolinas that's going to be dumping a lot of rain the Carolinas ... they're saying it will move faster than Florence so it won't present the same problems\nBut the problem is with the areas affected by Florence that are already saturated the ground is already saturated then of course any rain at all it's going to cause problems\nAnd they will be getting rain in those areas in the coming days are but a more immediately we're looking at a at a the panhandle of Florida and Panama City essentially a being the the target right now for hurricane Michael\nWell which when you disagree with the president how do you deal with it of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but if we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve and\nIt's like you arrive ... one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that your job\nYour job is to pair of what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with you and I as we've been talk shows too long we just we couldn't\nWe probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated they are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're a UN ambassador you have to\nBe the national security advisor to beef up to be in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to\nSomeone who is mimicking or or relaying a mess and and boat and said the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a mile or a [laughter] job John Hope [laughter] I'm not John Button was asked that he's he's always as it is they said\nOh look when when you were ... when when you were a you know when you were whatever uh uh ... five years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the president which do I was a private citizen back then the president believes that everything has changed at this point did I Do it but look\nI give the president advice the president I disagree I give him an advice what he does is on the national security advisor advisor they find that in ... what I tell him what did I tell them this is what I think you should do right he doesn't necessarily have to follow it and then when he says let's go and do it well then I tell you what the plan is\nThe the the president and I sit there and I'm just going to pull my hair out saying why are we going through this because everybody knows that already well ... but but do they\nIn a nation where they can't name the three branches of government well no you know I think the reporters do it because they want to they they are trying to find\nAnything to show that there is discord within the administration\n[noise] yes yes it is ... and they attempted to do that with Nikki Haley as you mentioned earlier and I think to your point the earlier point you might as well on the list of a possible abilities and and the possible people who might take her her spot I probably wouldn't have seen a Nikki Haley\nUh in that position as strong as she has been when she was governor I probably wouldn't have been able to say while she's going to go to the un and she's really going to Iraq some noise you know I don't think glow point so anybody I Know the list could be you know are just too strong a stronger as as she's been and\nI trust the president now or maybe not the first year so much but I trust the president now ... and also trust the situation and we said this in his second year as he moved into a second year of a presidency\nWe talked about how people who are going to work with him either on staff or in the cabinet\nWould know what they were in for after that first year and so anybody who accepts that role knows what they're in for which means they're up for that job as well from their perspective\nWe have a busy and

along with the era currently you know just a very quickly we we do have a hurricane\nUp coming up appalling the bottom of the hour with meteorologist ham hill he will join us but uh you know you make a great point when you talk about the fact that\nWhen you're talking about going I think both of us to make I made a fair point you made a great point ... but you really don't know what you're going to get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for I was making the analogy to you is almost like an NFL quarterback wrapped in NFL quarterback\nYou have no idea how they're going to perform you'd have no idea right and all the time they get on the field unions like oh they stink I really really good and we I'd mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders than that you know most presidential spokes people I don't like but if you would have told me when that and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it\nBut when she came aboard I probably went no I just don't think she has it right away was I wrong\nYou know and and and she has been very she doesn't even flinch anymore\nUh it it gives you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every single day now it's just it's more like a game\nAnd that's the way she plays it but at first it was not a game and it it's not an easy job it's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions like a John building you know you pretty much know where you're going to get the John Bolton but\nOtherwise ah there are a lot of people on that list and and and we'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for\nA not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course a what the president expect\nA drivers for cobra electronics you should be aware that there are parts of ice Seventy five and also I tend there on the Florida Panhandle\nThe last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was Kate in Nineteen eighty five and Kate's case Kate\nAt the same time is wins wrapping around the giant Winfield were causing storms and um and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas got a pretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with us and and\nYou know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are you are going to basically relate to a\nCake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five [noise] um but this is going to blow came out a little water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it still should be offshore and it will be probably ... bill a category three but\nDarn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in a in one hour for now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee bites Thursday evening it shouldn't be\nEntering the Carolina and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms\nAnd cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas\nAnd so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast and then they don't need any more destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour\nWhen it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning but on Wednesday\nToday or we're going to have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour and a and I'm probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour [noise] when we get to\nA coming onshore and the storm surges the other really bad situation [noise] ah from pretty much I don't want to include Panama City Panama City six to nine foot storm surge and that's in part because\nTheir shoreline faces a little more to the south west than so when it comes in if it comes in to the east the winds are going to be backing so it will reduce that effect\nBut you get past that to saint Joe which is on the uh an insular they're swinging around toward Appalachia cola [noise] ah we're looking at a storm surge that\nWill run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um\nOf nine to Thirteen feet while\nYeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\n... yeah and and then so we're talking about ah the again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI the storm surges as clearly from ... you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river [noise] and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight\nThey'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour and all the way through an average of fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night they're going to have a guess Wednesday night as this storm has come ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet\nOr excuse me rain I'm Sorry I was eight to twelve inches a foot of rain\nSo inland and even on the coast [noise] flash flooding is going to be a common of that ...\nThat range got to go somewhere and and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge [noise] um\nThen from there then you start dealing with you know the rain on top of that and so we saw that in New Bern a newborn uh on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the\nSoutheast and blowing up the Neuse River New Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point to the well\nAnd and we had the we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about the uh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues [noise] um that night by\nWhile I'm ... again ah the you know I there's this should go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible but people that are are in the path of this storm need to heat all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate\nA that this is this is going to be a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm\nA Tom ... in terms of ah the the rainfall you mentioned that we're going to see in some places maybe to twelve inches of rain um the flooding potential though won't necessarily be like it was because of foreign so because of the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee\nAnd then from there when we move across the border into Georgia we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas so I can pull up some maps and break that out um next time we talk buttery the the fact of the matter is that\nIt only takes you know it doesn't take a lot of water\nIf the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right\nAnd we all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place well the difference here is that this storm liked the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places some\nYeah ... and ... and when when you expected to onshore\nExpect onshore between three and four o'clock okay hum this afternoon they're\nAll right All right by me the wrong with this Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and hang on standing coverage for us as he mentioned with Hurricane Florence and also uh last year with a Hurricane Irma in in Florida so uh we are we just want to make sure that uh everyone knows we're going to be on this for you\nThis morning and tomorrow morning thank you Tom greatly appreciate it will talk to you in just a bit look forward to it thank you\nUh we will again also be checking in with our meteorologist the John ...\nA next hour I get an update from from him\nA and a ... as we go through the morning any updates also from officials in Florida or the national weather service will bring those and we do have a in another Fifteen minutes we will have the national Hurricane Center ...\nLatest report that basically the cone yeah and you look look at what Tom was saying and he's expecting a that this could be that could upgrade the storm to a category for hurricane\nAh with this next report that's coming out here and just a bit and we will go over that with Tom the next time we talk to them and we'll be doing that later in the in the program as well and again meteorologist John trout on board as well to give us a his latest

hurricane Michael\nA it is a set to come ashore uh sometime in the afternoon three or four pm mhm they're near Panama City\nFlorida and officials again you just heard a bug one mayor and other officials had been basically saying the same thing throughout the day\nUh yesterday they were saying ah you should be aware that a first responders going to be limited and being able to get to you and in many cases especially\nWhile the storm is at its strongest in that area will not be able to get too so you may not have power you may be in a situation uh that uh you will not be able to again\nA gift to any kind of a ... assistance or four hours\nAnd so are the best to get out of the way of the storm as soon as possible uh get inland go somewhere where you will be safe and where you are with others especially if you have an underlying medical condition or anything else that might warrant\nA that kind of a of a need so uh we'll see here and a little while we're going to talk with a meteorologist or John trout or get caught up on this latest update from the national Hurricane Center\nOr down the road for a possible third\nA nominee for ...\nAnd so we have uh the the latest in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a cab and all\nAnd the Donald he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has done only up by two well within the margin of error of three point to a five percent\nOr are they now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a ... you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrat in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied up that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out of it may be here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in a statistical tie Democrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nAnd again when you go into and I were not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in\nA you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans fight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races that are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level of going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the cabinet and hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's a ... right now looking at some of the the the Senate races up a you\nYou look at the the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane\nMichael [noise] uh and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily\nUm ... like a governor would during an emergency situation\nHow he handles it will be closely watched over the next few days because it's going to be it's going to be a very politically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his camp hotel you well we're not focused on that right now nor should they be\nBut people outside that a camp are focused on that and we'll\nBe altered the reality is that if\nFlorence was an handled properly by\nThe Trump Administration Democrats would be using them yes and and get it ends up being that is used in political races and and as you and I've talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more of the of of Florence a coming and then I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch on the weather channel you came across with a great opinion of the federal government and how they were how they were handling the s it'll be interesting to see if the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no doubt eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Gigi Keller and associates incorporated on customer service does your motor carrier provides uniforms for you to

motivate them I was actually a online and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about early voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which side as motivated more and historically where's that greater turn up the did you see the NBC reporter who went to the\nCollege in California ... and there's like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people and all of them sitting there and he said is anybody voting\nThere and the term not one person raised their hand ... found they found a bench they found one person here they found to people I said yeah we're going to vote but what's your concern well you know college and\nCost to college or what about the rational things on the Russian busted or we don't even know what's going on we don't know attention to that stuff that I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but I I guess the point think about this now because Hillary now coming to board\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democrat Party thinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump on board and say a civility now it's gone too we take over when not to be civil\nBogus civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to be civil and and think about what it's about now you're not civil because you believe in what\nDue process and a presumption of innocence ... that you look at any case a political case a civil case or a criminal case and you judge it by what the evidence that exists\nBecause you believe that does that word salt coalescing now it's ... it's it's getting right to that point now that you believe that\nYou may never be treated civil again\nWe will find you wherever you are you've heard that caller ready blew my mind or wherever you are well stock you wherever you are at your restaurant at your home nothing is off limits why because you believe in due process\nAnd you believe that's going to change people that believe and due process under the law that people that believe in the constitution and people that believe in fairness are going to be intimidated because you attempt to get in their face\nYou actually believe that you're a bunch of idiots in you believe that's going to change the opposition best it's going to do the exact opposite yours don't people for thinking that they are you\nAre and by the way please keep it up and thank you Hillary who by the way her version of due process is to\nGive money to her lawyers ... so they can hire fusion GPS so they can hire Christopher Steele to go get salacious and on verified information on her opposition her opponents in twenty sixteen and then have her friends and the Justice Department use it\nTo get a warrant on somebody in her opponent's campaign back due process for Hillary Clinton by the way how did that work out for her\nAnd did there was always a twenty percent chance of who's going to do that to me that's that's really the thing that's come out\nOf out of all this ... is the defense now I've been civility for those two to attack and go after those people or whatever where they are in their personal lives because they believe in due process under the law and that thoughts but in my head since last week thinking\nThey think there's going to be effective yeah who whose mind that think they're going to change their not going to change the people watching the TV who see somebody eating dinner and you get in their face\n... because they don't want to leave 'em alone let let let them eat their you know the the average independent who you're trying to convince them to know that's that's a that's ridiculous Hillary calling for instability well we're only going to be civil if we get our way right [laughter] yeah [laughter] John McCain\nYou hear this yeah no kidding yeah we're we're only civil when we did and that was the whole point with John McCain when they were talking about that we need more people like John McCain you're not seeing that about Joe Manchin are you know\nOh oh what you mean as you meet and you need more Republicans to act as Democrats on policy\nOh we told you the whole civility thing and it goes back because that's where it really got to its peak was that right John McCain's a funeral where the left was talking about civility and that's what we need and bipartisanship\nIs that what you've seen the last three weeks that right now there now you have there last presidential candidate calling for instability on

ah advisory was a just a little over an hour ago a and the wins the sustained winds went from a hundred and twenty five miles an hour to one hundred and thirty miles\nOf a per hour making it now an extremely dangerous as a National Hurricane center calls an extremely dangerous hurricane or if it hits as a four would be the strongest hurricane to ever hit\nThe Florida Panhandle in modern times in

be in in in some cases possibly\nAh impossible you could do could be in a situation where you were trapped in in that uh uh in that home or in that building and can't get out because the roads are filled with a water debris or all the above\nA is going to be again a situation that where you start seeing these stronger winds uh later this morning and then the guy anywhere between a most forecasters saying anywhere between a three and six PM come ashore there\nIn uh in Florida and then not only the storm surge as you mentioned Gary the the the rainfall potential you could see if they do wild inches of area or a a rain in the area and you could see it you will see likely flash flooding in some of those areas\nThat evidence is how you judge somebody's skilled right due process should apply and all of these cases which means you look for the evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race\nBecause of their age you believe people because the evidence backs what they what they say now you can believe that you can sit there and why I think that sounded credible that doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called him a rapist\nBecause that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and again rapist yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes\nThey believe Kevin on to it at the evidence isn't there right never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them because you say no I\nBelieve in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption of of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if I Need evidence and when somebody stories change I'm suspicious\nThose are all rational critical thinking commonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now calling for instability to harass you everywhere even invade your privacy where ever you are\nAnd it's not just the ah the old guard and Maxine Waters or even maybe Cory Booker people that are called the future of the party if\nIt's ... it's now Hillary yes well and and you know that you can easily dismissed and Maxine Waters in the Hillary as the old guard\nFor the future of the party is this so if if Hillary jumping out well and by the way\nHillary's jumping on board as you mentioned because everybody else's because she sees this as the future of the party ... and she and she also believes it's the mainstream of yeah already it's always ... saying it's okay to call to prayer instability because somebody believes and due process\nA presumption of innocence a preponderance of evidence to decide somebody whether you believe somebody is guilty or not you went from\nWeeks ago people talking about John McCain and we need more stability to the official call for instability in just a matter of weeks I you believe in due process under the constitution you believe in\nUh the presumption of innocence you don't believe somebody just because they say at the evidence as to prove it in their story should remain consistent you believe those kinds of things which are imbedded in the constitution of the United states\nThan you are a rape enable us to get a rapist enable is that what you are right and because you are no stability towards you that is their

where are some you Senator Tom cotton said that he believes Schumer's people leaked before word letter really yeah he was on with a huge huge show yeah instead I Believe like Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm\n[noise] well I mean if because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected ride it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibilities because if you were Feinstein you you don't take a determined Grassley you take a to Z sugar party letter right and then have him deal with it right for video a robot here's your forecast\nData from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins have increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher just possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane\nMichael extremely dangerous life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds\nAnd heavy rainfall expected as well as the potential for tornadoes to spawn from the result of a system where we get nine to Thirteen feet of water inundation along the coastline and as much as twelve inches of rainfall from the system\nAnd and and Kate was quite aid devastating storm\nA and at that point you have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things to come by well [noise] uh there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm this storm is an October storm ...\nHe was an October storm and there was a failure but a Celia was a major all these are major storms but Ophelia was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida and so right now\nIf you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that [noise] that\nOn Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to comment and that's after it's come onshore [noise] um tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore yeah\nRight now it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course uh you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the winds and ... and the destruction of property in and presenting a danger to humans but\nBut really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like\nThis I'm being a potentially life threatening in fact in his life threatening and is often deadly um and and that is something to\nBe aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... in in past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know wide lightning isn't the number one whether killer\nBecause we convinced everybody to go out and the lightning in right now [laughter] okay yeah indoors it's lightning right you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving\nAnd and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there is a waterway that water from\nThe Gulf of Mexico can move its way in [noise]\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian coal or or you are in Panama City or you're swinging around uh uh toward a the coastline just south of Perry and the big band\nThat you're looking at a a storm surge that it's going to be easily nine feet and\nIt would be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got applauded nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nFor those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mentioned\nThat because you know we've seen the recent video from the ... in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I described that to us what takes place during the storm\nBecause I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that you know are you right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what does the fat how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west may or the East Bay um\nAll the way up through um what they call a ... point lake which is is is really an extension the northern extension of the north bay a or the grand lagoon\nThis entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach I'm\nAn inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much it's kinda like turning the water on it's not like what you're seeing a snowman who were like so now it's turning the water on and watching you're about to fill and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer and the last\nHour and a half to two hours or so\nThe bath tub spill band so in the Carolinas the the\nI don't know if it was the record but it started close to New Bern North Carolina uh picked up a storm surge that was at least ten feet [noise] um there may have been a higher storm surge a further around the point I'm\nSaddened that sticks out there if the Carolinas [noise] um\nBut this one\nArms surge a further around the point I'm that sticks out there if the Carolinas [noise] um but\nThis water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth you need to be able to get to a place that's higher than the storm surge that's a really simple as a gift and this water is moving\nAnd and so the water has motion it can erode stuff [noise] um when I say it's moving ... it's it's\nNormal current and it's moving\nBecause it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed\nAnd so you got a certain amount of uh it's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension the water's Koslow that body down but it's still moving so ah the the place that I recall and I drove through this area a couple of times [noise] um because\nIt just a beautiful ride in your entity out here\nAnd you know if you've done this a germ free East Point the Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge and they're looking at Appalachian ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise]\nUm ... then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts ... and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet which still inundate those homes yeah\nThat's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one ah in in in Texas and the and the guy was scenario all summer and we have done that many times but if you've ever been to these areas and you've seen these houses on these still\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high\nBut add another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that it's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structured and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure and wildlife yeah great point of the higher center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily on ... and so again the timeline here we're looking for the eyes to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that it's going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north north east [noise] uh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time [noise] um\nBut if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth and we could anticipate the same coming in a little bit earlier the land around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now\nThey're getting rain right now ... has just had the light rain and in fact all of this is a very light rain and tropical rain starts off this little find drops and that increases from there\nUm and there's a couple of thunder storms that are running anywhere from apple logical up the Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining it'd be a real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far in London and how long do you expect that to be the case\nAll right let's assume that it it comes ashore and will do simply call where it is right now for ... forty five miles inland is what you would be looking at\nAnd forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out [noise] and it would take those winds back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area\nWhich is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to Panama City\nOr a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia call it a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more ... are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles from\nOur eyes and so so they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachian coal uh and\nPeter ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher Bond cats scale and ... products we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the Kurds America's most random checking me\nNow every meeting and watch me and my grows grows hasn't bringing the only weekly news show greater just joined us brawl the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly\nIn front of the dot com is the one you're not going to want to travel now mind when we walk on the news channel mind going to the ...\nVoice of eastern Iowa\nNews talk ...

I think six hundred staged power company people who are going to swarm in there the governor of Florida has called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards or guard twin or guards folks a\nBand or the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight you know let let me let me just ask you this because you did or you had predicted a before the last the advisory that show that went to a category of for you predict the would go up a couple of\nOf uh of of more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right you expected to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening as gets closer to shore in this particular case um you know the the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature [noise] um the other thing that's going on is that\nUnlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air\nThere is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near this and so [noise] uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the mid west and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area had a cold front\nThat warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and and ... and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't they won't die down\nOr what ever it gains he will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to degenerate\nWhat ever it gains a all carried to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee couldn't be saying routine I'm\nAnnie Wu maybe a little more than that ... mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachian coal a and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore this afternoon\nAnd and then they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour and\n... as so this is this is a fascinating point [noise] um\n... you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen [noise] uh savannah\nBecause of the wind field is going to have wins that are being dusting up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia toast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast um all of that area um potentially as far up as Morehead City um\nIs going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of a Florida and process Georgia across from Valdosta and probably somewhere between savannah and I'd go to a south of making and eventually comes up across Florence\nYa were looking at I'm looking at the map right here and and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get a by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and I didn't even mentioned Virginia but Chad goes that far north and and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter that\nThe Windsor gonna bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area a are still pretty significant um\nUm we're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia and Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of aid and trains\nWhile while uh and and\nThat causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore high water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give me another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave earlier um do you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and you go do this kind of heavy but it's cool [noise] well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road\nWhich is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something\nEven if we brought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a a ... ton pickup truck we're\nAt road level pounding on the road back and forth just kind of bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nGrade point great point what often there are\nSix us on water sixes on level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so there's
