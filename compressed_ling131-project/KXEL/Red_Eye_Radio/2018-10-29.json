extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs to get and you got as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind ...\nBecause you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase in prices in goods and services because the goods are going up and they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better\nActually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know

I ... I was back in New York and went to church my parents so we're just blew me away this whole thing that you want\nTo you know what I watched a while we were on a break recently I watched the movie a spotlight\nA that was the movie on the Boston Globe you know they had their their spotlight division for many years and they did the basically the expos they there are in in Boston and the the process of kind of following that you know through the years\nAnd at the time that the movie came out there was a lot that wasn't known\nAnd then you saw the uh the authorities come out about a Pennsylvania Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and then the latest about you know from buffalo and everything else\nUm but that movie was kind of startling it was when I re watched it it was even more startling you know it was it but they said in the movie basically what we said one of the characters in the movie\nI'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I ever go back to church again for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nIf you missed the chance to this weekend to be in a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country the upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota\nMost to Pennsylvania and New York in the New England states are past week this week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois\nWe could just say OK authorities canal just walk into homes at will\nAnd to just to see if any crime is being broken or committed an emu as in one of the neighbors uh uh the shooter the synagogue shooter was was talking on you know Fox News saying\nI didn't even have a new there was no clue that this guy would there was a white supremacist I I didn't know and I wish there was a way to you know to tell\nI Wish there was a way how do you know but even in a person's heart I mean maybe ... people close to them do um but then beyond that how do you know\nHow do you change\nTheir heart ah then how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate\nWhen we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate\nThat are potentially deadly well there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because uh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was the social media site for white supremacist\nAnd\nOkay so your we can say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of\nEnded up I mean how do you change your freedom of speech in a part of the reasons\nOr culture that's against the law we could pass a number of laws send it I mean how do you change your\nFreedom of speech in a part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are new know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you\nDo and and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason may be a I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this person's heart\nIs because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred and evil in their heart you know\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing\nFor what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any mass killer in our history well the list is very long\n[noise] you know I I was just I was going to the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting ah Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's a headline of an article written by former president Iraq Obama got us by what is a no one family Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I like the most was Justin Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news\nActually seems pretty nice\nIf you ignore the new view ignore the news that seems pretty nice well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just saw it but I but it it's something that you and I've talked about before where we we've said\nAh for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody agreed to how you doing with no one on your voting location what's going on good to see a oh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care of everyone I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice but I don't think I've ever had a\nNon pleasant time ever voting in my life but that's actually the reality of a you know of of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talking about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's it's\nThe news the news is what's unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news is the unusual right that's why why murders are new system because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but\nThe fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter a a a murder right many ... some families do but the majority of families in this country do not\nWhen you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders are quite low but when you look at the\nUh psychopaths that exists out there\nUh when I was just watching and how many the documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday\nAnd talk you know ... going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not named going through that progression of her there's no campy and then ten can enhance his brother had 'cause that Ted 'cause the exact same thing yeah that's a\nDoor on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with the reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um but there is no owners or or or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning at ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable that turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here\nOf the shooter at the at the synagogue\nYou know he's thinking about and\nI'm sure in in his mind these wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to you know close or is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with\nIn our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people\nAnd we can talk about disagreements but I always put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have debates and you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moment somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening any of you and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on to hear because when you put this all in perspective\nWe're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case and we should be the case\nWhen you talk about the the tactics white now being used\nDo away with the process do away with the constitution do away with the electoral college all of these things that are ultimately about giving individual's rights\nAnd and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something\nThat is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or debate\nIt's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people are very few\nHave these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts\nAs a society the the people are very few that have these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts we'd\nLike to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it and try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this\nWe'll talk more coming up if you'd like to get in lines open eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n...

years now and uh when you look now into modern times\nOf liberalism over the last forty fifty years sixty years in this country Seventy years ago all back to Social Security has been about a bigger

context soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people trying to come across a the the border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact he clarified that right after it happened yes\nBut again it was or what they did was they took it and they ran with it that that all are rapists and\nNow you said all

about the political divide in this country that we've had some very color so far we really appreciate it thanks to all people of other stories you want to make sure we covered in the back of your calls and comments\nOn the political divide in America I just I check all over this\nOne on um MSNBC on on Saturday chore read and the panel were in a discussion on voter suppression you know they've got the very tight race Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp for governor of ah of Georgia [laughter] than\nThey are trying to make a big deal he's for voter suppression voter suppression they're talking about the fact that\nAh there's you know there's a law in Georgia\nThat you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong they said after every two elections it's not it after seven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong it's after seven years you have to purchase it and they're like and voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression\nThe law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rose after seven years if you didn't vote ... if you didn't vote so some Democrats passed the law it's like yeah but he wants to do it [laughter]\nWe've passed that we didn't really mean that he means it they may [laughter]\nWe're Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls if you don't vote every seven yeah buddy he's actually doing it and he's a Republican so bad so bad he suppressing the vote I mean this is all by the way if you want the most bizarre issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n[noise]\nThat is when you think about it how bizarre that it\n\nYeah um it's huh it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money than we love it back into his raising a ton of money so and and then oh Casio Cortez\nShe did it was very little money\nSo they're not there one more example of them just\nBasically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and we'll well we need to change that well that works against this\n\nBy the way voter fraud doesn't happen the story's a couple of weeks old but I I Want to bring it because we we got involved there were so many different topics going on we were on vacation never got to this a couple of weeks ago for women were indicted in North north Texas voter fraud ring\nHave probably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more that are voting for Greg Abbott but will not vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who will vote for federal ... why would be my question mhm\nRight because there's such a disparity if if there is and and right now or a with a real clear politics or he's roughly up a a Ted Cruz roughly seven points\nThey they move that I think in our cp though as to now lean it's not a close to ... Republican ... uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it once by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question well\nYou know we have to point out and I don't know if this was a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer to that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nBut we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the Damon Cole I yeah I agree with you you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know ah there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the RMC at the convention in the summer and twenty sixteen yeah but\nThe age but now he's beautiful ... yes right well because now is useful but if you decided to challenge the president a way to manage it in twenty twenty\nNow he's beautiful ... yes right well because now is useful but if you decided to challenge the president a way to manage it in twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course that changed your bet if I was new to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me\nEven though the president is with him and Houston I'm not I mean I I think you would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other\nAnd it it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty six thing\nI Would love to see those those how many votes for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for ...\n... yeah I Know there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but ... Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered that in fact been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but\nWe'll see what word comes together I guess on election day and and how many people actually did vote for Abbott wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of

political divide in this country and why\nIt is they're hanging on James ... and more will get your calls and comments coming up a following the bottom of the hour and really we went from it from our point of view why we see the political divide you know what is it about what issues are at about you know we talk about the well I mean the over the weekend it was like all her everybody's and rage and they're angry well why are they what\nIs it about is all the anger just pure emotional ranges and they'd be based on anything that's good well of course did it\nUh you know George W. Bush and John McCain well they weren't Hitler Hitler but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the most the lab they really want to come out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is the most recent with Iraq\nThe current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right down the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow there's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the ... out of the mindset of groupthink\nThat it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I was trying to some of the other foot you're here you're pouring the finger at a\nPhase or coke implantation what I'm saying what what are you are on right now that one out loud to think as you really think because when when you talk to black folks about the homosexual affair and the marriage thing or whatever\nThe talk of the ... issue as they lined up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their business so brave brainwashed into fishing of racism racism racism racism at clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I Wonder because you know we've talked about the identity politics with the with the ... with the Democrats and and the identity politics that have really\nI think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's must recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and when I start thinking about that and wonder\nHow many because we said that we said what the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jump to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there saying wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just\nA ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent of the challenges are so what does this fight banned for it and we put it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that\nYou can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race so there because there's transgender ism there's also trans racial Islam\nAnd they want you to believe well if you that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights\nYou identify will hold on a second because if you look at a you know the the the civil rights at\nThe protected groups created under the civil rights that if there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group then there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups\nThen the civil rights era and is done it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there all that entire battle it's we're not\nAnd not only that you know the um the civil war was for nothing new fight\nAgainst other oppressive a governmental systems\nThere are no ... why do we you know just to say oh we should have done that uh we're we're on another different paths now so I'm like no we are America this with America we're not saying that we're at a state of visual better than anybody or any other country\nFor say a ... is a better than everybody else is already because\nYes and I and and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they\nThey don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives enough to write that you do you want acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town\nThat we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can't have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative but he left the Democrat ... well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics\nOr changed him but when you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties I cared about\nAnd then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice and the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I found incredible the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming\nFrom the Democrats\nWouldn't want to black about a bad situation um lay fully understand that a lot to remember there was a ... white lady that was several years ago she ran away\nAnd uh she waited on two black males as so every\nBlack belt that within the city in okay before they're screwing it and they came up especially just wanted to run away while you know so\nSo I'm like well you have to understand that that if you go to that system will be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against Bush ...\nJames uh thank you so much apps and some are shamed great start with and uh yeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me from a conservative and live my life well\nYou know what's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the free of that corner not not our street but the the the cross street there\nIs a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level\nAnd I just I just wonder I haven't asked to me because I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative but I haven't had a chance to ask him has anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs\nYou know from your yard because he has them right there on the on the side where the big street it and so\nI don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's working in the yard I you know I I think\nThe ah a group that the president spoke to the young black leadership summit ... and the responses that you got in the media coverage of it\nAnd James like our our last caller and this is striking fear I'm not saying there was a monumental change in in a black spoon to vote Republican but they're much higher profile now and getting much more coverage the left\nCannot permit that they must demonize every single person who would tend to do that because you're talking about a solid demographic base that they have held for a long time a long time you have a long long time eight six six Ninety read I was\nAnd radio told ... ex marine robotic [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling a shovel to tell a hotline at eight
