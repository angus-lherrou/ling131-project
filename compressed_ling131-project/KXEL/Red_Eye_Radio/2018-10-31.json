to a jurisdiction means more than simply being present in the United states\nWhere the fourteenth amendment was being debated in the Senate center Lyman ... keep figure in its strapping an adoption stated that quote\nSubject to the jurisdiction of the United states meant not only know legions to anybody else send up quote ... and senator Jacob powered who introduced the language of the claws\nOn the floor of the Senate contended that it should be interpreted in the same way as a requirement of the Eighteen sixties six civil rights act which afforded citizenship to all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power\nOr the Supreme\nCourt has never decided otherwise now the problem is though as a let\nMe see I've got the ... right here in the Eighteen Ninety eight ruling that that is being brought up by many people on the left and you see Ninety eight ruling in the wrong Kim our case the Supreme Court held the children of non citizens when born on us territory are us citizens by birth however\nThe parents in question in the long case were legal immigrants meaning that the court did they may have had it in their opinion but they did not address actually the status of children born to parents in the U.S illegally they made that claim but that was not\nA a case where they actually made you know a decision on it it was an opinion in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes it at that point being is that the\nParents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it\nAnd that makes it at that point being is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it\nAs he writes here he goes what the Supreme Court has held this re novel back Johnny spent\nThe Supreme Court has never held otherwise some advocates for illegal immigrants point to the Eighteen Ninety a case of the United states versus wrong Kim arc but that case merely held but a child born on us all the parents who are lawful permanent legally ... residents was a citizen even though they said in it\nThey expand that it out that wasn't part of the law so they actually did not create legal precedent at that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the president would have with that and and by the way I'm I'm from the and and I I Know you are to a ... I'm from of course when you understood why they pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with\nYou know after reconstruction and you don't have to I'm a liberal writes activating sixty somewhere right right where you knew what that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes that that's what that's what it was all\nAbout because the parents are of of those children being born the children being born slaves the the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction\nNow that the problem is because uh I as I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I'd I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live but [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty years more All right let's throw out a figure\nThirty years [noise] um you know I I I still don't think will will will see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this\nUh but the problem is the Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act they added a portion that basically\nAgreed with the way\nThat the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't they didn't specify and they didn't say a children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the courts probably will looked at that saying well since at that time\nThey didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpreted that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent it was an opinion or based there that the court might just refuse to hear it\nRight\nAnd send it back down and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction meaning of ... we will get a bench Lee someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it the hell are two thousand eight\nWas it two thousand eight hundred thousand five\nTwo thousand I forgot about roughly two hundred and Thirty years had if I ate it took ... to finally have the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment yeah that it was an individual right so\nA two thousand at a time flies so that that's the problem in the ... you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't don't see it but those are the legal challenges\nThat you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's now law\nWhich uh again this is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it as he threw construction as she would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would say construction is doesn't say it if you want to say it differently than say differently\nBut it but it doesn't include it but will it ever get to that point where they even\nThe Supreme Court actually here's and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place is my question and again I just I don't see it in the next\nThirty years I'll Try that out for a dry but it's a way to start the ball rolling\n[noise] ... yeah I mean I I think uh it certainly brings up the the debate and we if if the president is you know going to take action near through executive order then you're going to see it in the courts the question is will the high court\nTake a case like this and and so when you look at the question yesterday where I chuckle when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question [laughter] kind of president do this with executive order will of course he can if nobody challenges\nCan do it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to\nThe the care of it\nToo well illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong or whether he's doing it now or any other time\nAnd the approach maybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if this thing 'cause they know full well it's going to be challenged\nAnd so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now we understand to the uh the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly\nOr by just the announcement of between you know now and and uh well six days for about the mid term but beyond that it is also something that I think in the current political climate that has to be discussed because ultimately what does it do\nNow it it it brings up the discussion but I think it gives us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will position the Democrats to finally say that they're for open borders mhm\nSo that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick to this isn't going to happen\nOr\nIt the the executive order will come out and it will be immediate an injunction immediately will be paying immediate block from the courts\nAnd then they will do went to the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to get ... and I don't go to see if it ever\nRight and this is something that I thought I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no I didn't 'cause because it's it's not like the travel ban right that affected people immediately right\nI I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no cars because it's it's not like to travel ban right that affected people immediately right\nSo it would just not jailing with what like what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the cage and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat that we had people traveling from certain parts of the world\nThat had been trained and that more coming here and that yeah it\nWas reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world\nAnd and that was something that they could make the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is it's an immediate threat or has been a threat for a long long time the problem is well get technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years but\nIt is not something that is going to be fast tracked because they didn't as it is not adding any kind of knew immediate threat we understand what's going on with the

destroying the planet your pet\nI knew what I've been watching her for a while she goes out and she you know especially on a sunny day she'll she'll lay on the grass she's just trembling the grass just laying all over you know and she's not a small dog\nAnd bad ... says that if the Democrats don't win the house she's going to move to Canada\nI thought all the celebrities will be out as soon as they said hey pot legal\nWell here's the thing what she's saying that in January 'cause right now you know if you look at ... five thirty eight then a okay there you know what I mean is that one of those same things to say she no she\nDoesn't have to leave right I'm going to pretend that I'm going to leap as right like way we are bad look we know the Democrats are going to take the house we know where OK I'm going to make this proclamation well\nBut what is I think is the you know I mean what\nWhat would be the the the gold thing that I mean what do you think that are going to do now people are going to go man we better get out and vote for a Democrat otherwise Barbra Streisand's gonna move to\nCanada yes I Can't live in a country that bad doesn't live in\nI Can't I Can't [laughter]\nI just I Can't I Can't well but that's I mean because that's really if you think about it that's the underlying uh you know I guess thought behind saying something like that\nThat she's going to protest well she knows she's a celebrity for those under sixty Barbra Streisand was\nAnd again we ... we don't play those games we've said look you're not going to change it free speech exist and people the the the rhetoric has been heated in this country\nOr for a long time yeah it's amplified now because social media exists so it seems like it's worse than ever remember when he used to personally insult the politician we used to have duels in this country\n\nYou will be challenged to a dual so that actually existed and\nAnd so yeah we don't deal with it but we understand we don't deal with that type of rhetoric on the show it's not how we want to explain we had a we have told people that agree\nWith you know majority opinions that we have who sometimes used those tactics we believe it's wrong that the left has to use it because they don't have anything to argue they can't argue the substance of the issues we can there's no need for us to do that\nThey need to do it because they're lost ... we're not last their last\nUh but when it comes down to it when you want to see the different reaction of right there\nThe letters that were said now the castor bean is themselves were not toxic but it doesn't matter from what we know or the FBI still hasn't said whether those were alive explosives or not in fact we know one of them was not the one cent to CNN right we know that was not\nA but when you look at it\nWhen you look at the reaction of the media to similar instances one and and those are the these are emblem sent to the politicians in power right now and two appointed individuals in our military and the CIA\n\nWas or anything on CNN where they were blaming the left\nNot was there anything on Fox where they were blaming the left for no no it was just quiet the story came out of people moved ... you know people moved on and said okay yeah ... I brought back memories we talked about uh brought back memories of nine eleven and then we moved on a good looks like they caught the guy\nBut now the charges officially filed last week during all the the\nUh uh\nCoverage of a ... you know the um the mail bomb scare\n...\nWere they treated the same by the media for those were not biased we're not biased you can be biased by including one story and making accusations against one party on one story that shouldn't be related to them at all and you ignore the other story mhm\n\n[noise] yeah I mean it it was not that it's as if okay yeah that happens fine I'm comes with the territory as Don Lemon right might say\nAnd that's it\nNow it's a given that high profile individuals politicians and presidents are going to be a target of a number of attempts\nWhy the secret services in place or for presidents and that's why most people even if they're not serving the public there the even in the private sector or they're they have a high level very high level of security\nBut the point is is that the the media went\nAll over\nWhen it works for when they believe that works for their side they stay on for a long long time they will ... is the story but it doesn't work for them politically if it's the other way around\nAnd the other side of the targeted and\nWe can send that reminder to a bit of what happened to ... and the attempted assassination of multiple Republicans that's something uh Don Lemon and CNN apparently needs to be reminded of\nYeah yeah I saw that yesterday that could come up yeah yeah in fact skull lease wrote a a ... ... you know to that one right\nWell the interesting thing is as they talk about the fact that hateful and spiteful about rhetoric in and bring it up is what causes these murders and then that's exactly what they proceed to do\nWas to ah MSNBC is a a\nContributor Steve Schmidt ... said conservative radio host like rush and mark Levin have blood on their hands for mass shootings and other crimes perpetrated by crazy people he also included judicial watch news busters judicial watch Breitbart judicial watch\nWhat is there just to watch\nAll they do is to get the information to the people they're not ... if you look at what judicial watch is it's all about getting information specifically documents right documented evidence for information to the American people\nOh oh oh\nForget it [laughter] and we can't have\nThat [laughter] that\nSee because the point would be from the left well you are you know you're you're part of the problem so you get people motivated by how in the world\n\nWould judicial watch could get someone motivated to do something violent and any of the others by the way out for mentioned in yet within that list but ... you can't put judicial watch up in terms of controversy the only\nControversy there is the only debate there is between the people who want the truth and the people who don't\n\nIn terms of why they exist and their attempt in their mission statement\n\nHas anybody ever debated anything that they have been able to uncover any documents that they have been ... been able to ah to essentially bring to light\nWell I heard that uh you know mark Levin dissected the fourteenth amendment in the constitution today so certainly he has blood on his hands rice explaining the Constitution's ... how dare he [laughter]\nWell but here's the thing by the way some people do a mark works for the same company that we do but the people know that but yes um but so no one at a MSNBC or CNN or any of the others are response now no\nYeah mark 'em but so no one at a MSNBC or CNN or any of the others are response no no\nNo just [noise] or you would have to come out and and then accused them of course being responsible for the attempted multiple assassination on that ball field on that day were the ... was shot\n\nBy a if you say one side is responsible you have to say the other side to ... there's no way to ignore that you can try and ignore that but you just look stupid doing yeah but I what I just I Love than\nIt is the fact that as they denounce the fact that heated rhetoric causes people to commit murder ... they just gave up where the wild and in sane and crazy accusation\nYeah bump but Michael Moore say rabbit up wrap it up so here you go that's the response will wrap it up\nBest ridiculous but so that would mean also that Twitter and Facebook and social media federal response to have to go though they don't have to go free speech is the problem or anything that that any of these individuals who are actually responsible for this anything that they participate in\nHis response right well know anybody that they disagree with right yeah\nWell I mean I'm Talking about is if this person of ... this is saying that your you know that that uh that that talk radio and\nBy the way the way he called his show watcher he's he's labeled a former Republican strategist but he has no conservative and he's no no he's he maybe he may be somebody who's he may be a case like [laughter] it's like\nJohn Case of these apps and the critical thinking right we can just ended their he can call himself what whatever he wants to\nHave you noticed the number of people that call themselves Republican strategist yeah and conservative who are not any that maybe they claim they were at one time but they're not anything

Congress said okay you know we ... this is this is the law this was in Congress except the with the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty two of the justices to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship but it didn't include it in any Congress person or anybody who uh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up\nBecause as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be not as to why Congress did that in Nineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if I go to war to decide to define who would applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to define clearly Ina decision I don't think there's going to happen but if they were to do that would that normal fi\nThat law from Nineteen fifty two\nIf it is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment or the citizen has all day the fourteenth amendment is clearly defined if the if the Supreme\nCourt heard it and the Supreme Court said no here's what it says then the what Congress did in fifty two would be gone that's what I mean\nOh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that ... that law so why do they could one one ...\nAnd and that's the interpretation which means that does not to let you have to get past that part and that is what I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't ...

even know or vice president's name was Joe Biden my high school classmates for Republicans were very vocal about it especially during the whole Romney and Obama election I realized I didn't believe everything that they were saying\nThen I Google Republican versus Democrat I like kind of both kind of not that's why I'm an independent it wasn't until the Trump versus Hillary election that I realize how important it was the boat maybe it had to do with like society and all\nYou know every maybe\nEvery one I was following was like go out to vote I was in college in Massachusetts I decided that I wasn't going to go through the long process run out of state student to register to vote either hectic schedule I just didn't have the time\nAnd energy it's just not that important\nAlso I didn't know how my parents would feel about the whole thing 'cause my brother does not bode either so it wasn't asked if they could to help us out with the registration and mailing all the forms to us\nSo she doesn't want to get by with their parents with my mom was a Republican and my dad as a Democrat [laughter] I Wonder if she's ever bought a concert tickets on line [laughter]\nYou know you ask yourself okay is there anything because millennials aren't stupid if they want to go to a concert or something oh man boom they pull up the up a boom boom boom boom they've got tickets right\nOh boating oh no no mailing things gives me anxiety toward preview who rode along his report got\nVery very line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today\nAs the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today and the same band or showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio\nA so an act of Congress can certainly be changed and overruled by the court\nNotified by the older you know sort of\nHalf white lie you know they'll have one life if you if you had Congress come out today\nAnd and pass a law steady and look you know that the Nineteen fifty two law was just\nAn you know is an assertion that that we believe in the fourteenth amendment but we as Congress do not believe that the fourteenth amendment covered birthright citizenship that's up to the Supreme Court to decide because we don't clearly see it in the in in the text\nAnd we believe that you know and and you you pass this law and so we we you know we either we either pull that Nineteen fifty law out or we amend the Nineteen fifty law\nTo include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that I I don't think you'll ever see Congress do that I'm saying they could do that for a and and then at that point\nThe the courts would say will Congress was looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario 'cause it's not going to happen but I'm saying they could do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to different safe now sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion in Nineteen eighty Ninety eight even though it wasn't a precedent that was said it was an opinion the opinion lean that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah they could do\nLower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a\nA law that clearly is and how it's\nBeen interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly not being viewed by modern society as\nThe makers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did for they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah yeah a lot of federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was said precedent to their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right\nYeah yeah yeah thank you Scott we appreciate it um I I because yeah that\nIs the\nThe argument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou hear that if if they were to take this case if the if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenging gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion\nI'm In the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact but the impact remember is on\nWould be on on on children that would be born to aliens and in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even the we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here of to this point to a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply\nThat's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children\nBorn in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there that is that is not immediately effected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban well you and I had to go back and\nScreamed the word temporary how many different times\nBecause the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was you know again it was played out and it ended in a different\nIn a different way out of the media but it's not going to it's not going to it wouldn't be the same and and consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nHas never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never said it was\nCongress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress\nThe way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that is was not a legal precedent that was said that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought fat there's never been a serious legal\nYeah that is was not a legal precedent that was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought fat\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have all judges even construction is judges even cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say\nWell there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over\nA fight going on constantly for that and constant precedent being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about a specific type of\nBehavior that we allow were gun rights can be every gun issue is a different issue in a different law and a different state\nAnd they might look at and say this is pretty clear that the interpretation whether the author want it or not but the interpretation taken and accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendments thought\nIt's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed that back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their\nOpinion of the Supreme Court\nAnd a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe\nThe country has come to a consensus up rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what they would that's what I think where I think it's going to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a law can be passed it will be vague and somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged\nWell and and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge that's never at a new challenge me is that no one has ever stepped up to travel\nI I agree I agree with you on that is why I took two hundred Thirty years to get you know that guns are and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in\nThis country yeah treasury Eighteen Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of ... what about the parents who\nAre here illegally but the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that where I made the claim that they are right that every court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever ... challenge at and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you can be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically\n... that's the problem right bullet hasn't been challenged uh so that's the question do we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or not one sought to define that claws well\nI I agree with you I Believe without question you have somebody on a ... look\nOr you know when when you see that when if I was a judge and I'd say well look let me look at the average like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution say well I'm going to flip a coin\nAnd and the word lands that's going to be my opinion and you go back and you look at the first to mentor the second amendment as many of the just as the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that ... because it isn't a it isn't a law that has written specifically there is no specific the it it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what we're I've talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment\n[laughter] and uh they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in there mhm it really\nDoes have because the argument would be made then and this case coming from the other side well\nIf if [laughter] if\nAh Jacob power the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended it to be such than the citizenship clause should have been written ...\nExactly and since it wasn't the only thing you can do is go back and see what the authors mindset was who actually wrote the bill the members of Congress or wrote that amendment that got passed ... that ... there's nothing else you can really go on you have to go on that if your original list\nWith thousands of buyers and

Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you I always caution but uh but what was I don't understand why\nSome people are saying or find the birds ... executive order will go by Trump or the president is stupid 'cause ... executive order clarify law\nBy our my understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author and the guy talking about ... our intention in order to ensure the fact that the fourteenth amendment does not extend to aliens or people who are ...\nWhile the the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got the SCOTUS it would be the job of ...\nTo interpret that would be the right out of his more human beings job of his lawyers to defend it\nBut the secular border in itself\nA is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual ...\nIt would yeah and the actual court case so the branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now and I am very pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge\n[laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge then it would it would stand and it would be the law the when well yeah 'cause that was the question going on yesterday which I thought was a stupid question\nGotten the president right an executive order to change the law and and what did hold on to well yeah sure he could write an executive order for him saying but I don't know what I Do many challenges and yeah then yeah but it's good at ... there'll be an injunction\nAnd there'll be an injunction and the law will never which I find like a good be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department\nMaybe some input ... to say that\nYou know let's attempt to get this and at at least for the president I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put a just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen\nOn controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about\nUh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or ... or at least the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't write an item night on the well I don't believe it ever will but but\nI still do when people say well he's just because she's just campaigning\nAnd\nHour and ... why not viewing this is part of the campaign promise from Ted I was not exceed\n... that was where I Would do and exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI could see if you're upset saying he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill trying to paint herself as a Republican fried judge who happens to be running as a Democrat yes\nNow that's something you should complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you got many Democrats trying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats aren't I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons is he got elected was\nIllegal or immigration and immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to uh just to the campaign before the midterms well mom the caravan thing\nThe only way you could make that point is if\nOh he's doing it just to uh just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing\nThe only way you could make that point is if\nHe financed the caravan which I don't believe he did but I don't think so and therefore when it's just happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nMight help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on and it'd be consistent in his opinion why would anybody but he'd be upset about a recall it strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans right\nExactly that's the campaigning that you should be upset\nAbout because that would be an action and I the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged and the ... he knows that\nSo he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yet politically well that's okay because it is not something based on nothing is not going based on imagery\nI had last asked the question a few years ago how many cats and dogs gym now she said seven cats and for dogs ...\nWhen I saw her recently I said hey how many catch you have now and she said well I have four dogs and said oh what I said what nine cats ten thirty three\nThirty three cat yes\nHer and her spouse actually put a extra room on the house so the cats can walk in and out to non heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together well but thirty three that's three cases of cat food a day [laughter]\n[laughter] I I don't know it's it's ... name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots or and I told you this was coming along time ago Jeff we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million pets having detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the waste that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims ...\nHere the energy and animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them\nIncluding fecal production\nThe problem isn't just the United states now or the or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners or be owned more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership ... compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help that emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit wants or the or that test of settles yes so so what do we do with adult\nWe supposed to put the dog down\nOr just after this dog not get another one hey I never search for\nA cat I rescued one had rescued you let's be clear right by the way you're not the only person that said so that to me this week yeah I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a\nMango is a black cat just ... Halloween bond Halloween you know the funny thing is I had I had a a bug few weeks ago and I had all the stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector\nActually the smoke detector I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it beeps after about ... euro yeah\nA a smoke detector actually the smoke detector I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it beeps after about an item in a row yeah the tall is part of my house\nOf course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I'm not this incredible ladder widened base and everything else and so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out really tested capabilities fright so I get up there and realize okay this is in my like I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days\nSo do I take down a ladder not leave the ladder to leave it might take it out yeah the letters there for a couple of days and I noticed that the cat black cat keeps walking under the ladder thought that if there's a lot so I figured it was\nAll that stuff and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's good luck thoughts I never had before uh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help and emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare expert to conceive that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets shifts particular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nThey're so uh are there you go the study the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking them the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah that's actually a point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point are and I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian\nI'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to have both of them today I might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember and this goes back ten years ago I think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he has no bigger than\nTwenty five thousand people ... and ... how ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah we're not while they were going to I think it was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere where do you do with him I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with [laughter]\nAnd who decides who goes and and I think it was out of the of the probably the closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one right so what do you do with the game [laughter]\nOkay what's what's your plan I they are you going to me the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works\n[laughter] are you committing suicide first right\nHey that'd be a cool ... movie right it's the end of the planet we're down to what ten years\nJust some kind of doomsday whatever climate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base 'cause that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say you know\nThe chunks of ice just start falling out of this guy or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr that would be called the day after tomorrow um [laughter] so [laughter] that's not making about climate change this time I'm not whatever right but\nIf we could whittle it down to one billion people and then it would be\nOver the ... you could make this a series over the period of years you know because you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out to kind of figure out how to deplete the population\n[laughter]\nI don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek ...\nRemember how the the two forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed war and then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall hadn't the ... member that one yeah I don't know they were they open\nThe window and they're like all these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't\nKnow how would they ever solve that problem yeah\nDon't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand six\nUh haven't said was about essentially a the there was the women could not give birth there was what ever happened in the apocalypse they no longer have the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her\nBecause all governments would want you know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and and they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they can protect her\nBut I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically\nAs lessening not in the crazy way that the Democrats or talking we far out far left liberals are talking about and in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a psi phi thing of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean that would do is it's not that it would be one of those those questions\nAlmost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah oh yeah that was very clear that that uh Well Bruce Willis uh you know ...", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "31"}
