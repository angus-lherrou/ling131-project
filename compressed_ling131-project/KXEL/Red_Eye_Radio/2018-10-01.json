Europe isn't going to be able to make up the majority of the story being lost to we have had and civilian aircraft\nGot hit a real big in in in July of last week economic indicators coming out that ... you know because of the tariffs\nAre that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago that it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you when I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down but the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president has had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro but you know\nThe ... and they're telling him you cannot have these kind of massive\nTariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and China it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish to be president in twenty twenty you got to reverse course got you've got to come up\nWith a a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that but you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that\nAnd so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last second knowing\nThe administration knowing that look Congress is not going to approve just a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA's gone and nothing replaces is going into the going into the midterms\nAnd then uh wanting to have economic growth\nIn two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you just said ... gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe\nYou've got advisors to the president's saying you can't do this did you hear it a Christian or was the one they say that was one that that got everybody to come down\nAnd dirty ... there was one right bring that to them like well really well\nI mean the reality is is that again or you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deal so you're left with nothing or you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nTexaco deal so you're left with nothing or you get this when and claim you know you can at least calling but you're selling more dairy to Canada if you can if you can call it a win which if you're selling more it's it's not less well look we so we ... we said this already\nThat they're you know to try to to try to regulate and international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international economy but the reality is you can stop it\n... you can isolate yourself but you can stop it it's impossible\nBut when you have as we talked about in Mexico per capita were day if you look at the trade going back in ... in fact a back and forth across the border and it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico\nBut in a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states\nAnd the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times they say it was four tires and we were selling Mexico to begin with per capita that's their population for every dollar they ... that you know they send to us we sent them three dollars they're smaller country\nThey've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population of the United states Canada has like what one eight of the population the United states and we were\nUh selling them like for every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought as in you know per capita that's per person in the United states of Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars over the last couple of beers\nPer capita is what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible\nBut there's no way you'll never get there no I mean I don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states wanted me to be close no so uh\nAgain we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know both started leaking out hopefully in the ... next couple of weeks especially since now goes before Congress in ... update on what's in there for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow in the higher elevations of a mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nA\nFlake in fact announced that he was going to vote yes all of a sudden he gets cornered in an elevator\nThis is the difference between [noise] I'm\nA well this is exactly what ... what really got us here was the idea of putting all this on television and the first place because now the left feels empowered\nTo be able to change the landscape by screaming by shouting at you and they will be thanks to Jeff Flake\nThey they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting at him and that elevator was all over social media on friday this is why we go direct\nGoing direct means getting in your face which means expect more of that were ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flakes hatred for the president they don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to come by his situation now he knew he wasn't going to win in November So we decided not to run\nThen he of course there's been going off on the president on a number of things holding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items hostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly but see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump you can be in agreement for that this thing with them they don't care\nThe ... or your disdain for Trump you can be in agreement for that this thing with them they don't care 'cause you're still the bad guy\nSo he goes in and he of course decides he's going to hold up the vote I'll support it in committee but I'm not going to support it\nOn the broad vote well\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well so now you have the background check\nNot in this is not an investigation no one does not know it it is a background check with a series of interviews\nHit is they've done several already they're going to do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on on to the president for limiting the scope ... this is only amount of the accusations but it does include the Ramirez accusations not just the Ford accusations right\nSo now you have again the claim being made and now it's going to have been by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with a Ford accusations and you got what the FBI going and doing interviews and they will not make a decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate\nThat's how the all of this is going to work so you delayed it by\nA week or if you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere and you start screaming perjury\nWell the house isn't going to bring up perjury charges perjury for what exactly what specifically and where's the proof that he lied about it\n\nSee the problem with the the Ford allegations is that you cannot they they it's in it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been\nPresent out they initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a Ford who said he lied when he said but he lied about his drinking\nRight how yeah right\n[laughter] I'll just how is that I you know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm\nAnd in high school he likes very still likes fear right you know and and your because he would have to get down\n... said he never order in every city boy he never he said he never blacked out right now but he said he fell asleep after drinking ... but you might have you know but but how do you [laughter] well I didn't get my ... you you don't know if he blacked\nOut or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I I don't I don't understand\nWell you know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president\nBecause I don't know I remember a ... Obama and the and and ah and him smoking pot and the story of him some aligned by paying all of this but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know but but the point is the perjury is what\nGoes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell then this is and then you got to push back of course on Sunday from a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy is not a stumbling drunk\nBut essentially goes back to label labeling him Kavanaugh as such from high school oh gosh ah I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton\nWith with ah with Brock Obama and others oh it only matters is if he's if he leans white if he's a threat to the left then we're going to shout well we never you never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nWell I I what I also love was how they move the goal post were first on friday a and part of Saturday it was he's two part just\nBecause of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the data that he was that it that he was too partisan right and and can't cannot survive he doesn't have have he doesn't happen it takes because he's too ... well the part that turned into because then the\nThe uh uh the report came out about ... gator Britain's Ginsberg back in twenty uh a sixteen where she said uh uh but um\n[noise] uh\nShe calls Trump fake her she's getting involved in politics you shouldn't be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals mhm he didn't take on the say the entire Democratic Party he said you well and I had written in in one story\nA because there was no promise a that he could he could a ... he could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me\nYou've got sort of my or on tape on record saying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\n\n[noise] the whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan that the president nominated now there would still be objections he must be up to something that would probably be the objection [laughter] it's Trump he must be up to something\nI mean he could have nominated Merrick Garland oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland and he's the wrong choice I mean it it would have been something some kind of objection\nBut for the media [laughter] is that there is no promise that Kavanaugh would leave is biased as side right ALS you what first of all but they still don't get it\nRight but then they drop that ... they dropped that in became his temperament\nAnd became his anger it wasn't that it was directed at that because once again spring thing came out of the women Ginsburg has been political all the time and then they had to drop bats and they went to the next thing they moved the goalposts again which is his temperament and you know Feinstein has gone to the you know as a petition\nOr the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um\n[noise] uh uh their ranking of him as a from well qualified and because of his temperament because of a screen or because of his anger mhm yeah right\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalpost and but on the Gulf holds the goalpost\nBecause Grassley and flake let it happen they allow them to move the goalpost\nIt goes all the goalpost because Grassley and flake let it happen they allow them to move\nThe goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks\nEssentially passed when it should have happened\nThe vote\nSo that's on them ... ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake\nYou're talking about friday this ... they had the number they didn't have the numbers and had no choice oil apparently this is where it\nThey've changed recording do report as flake was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check\nBy the right to the idea I mean the ab the American bar association or she's gone to them and said you know he doesn't have the temperament disturb because he got angry excuse me somebody you're in it and that just beautiful ... they they sit there and they accuse you they do not her\nTwenty years consolidate credit can do is work with your credit to lower your payments and reduce or even eliminate your interest charge as he should be able to have anything to jail for years after ... head lady to celebrate us freedom from ... we're\nConsolidated credit we're here to give you freedom from that goal know where you're ... you know and it was an easy call ... years ago\nAll even during my mind degrees that would be covered my mother used to have an eight hundred I but I Do see some of\nThe great service to the British\nBy the\nMinority of the ... which is why they were just they originally commissioned like it was not easy thirty\nTwo boys in eastern Iowa\nNice tall ...

then I'll walk but it would give the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury if their answers differ from what they previously said\nThis is something I I was talking to a family member when this was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different because you can compare forged testimony\nTo her what she told the Washington Post the Washington Post things could change drastically by the time she testifies and some things didn't change\nSo\nNow what's different is of course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't have there is no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with wood lying to investigators here with the FBI but\nIt is official record after she testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday mhm she hasn't been interviewed yet now we're mirrors has not testified under oath she hasn't been interviewed according to reports on Sunday\nSo at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after sworn testimony\nThen that opens the door to perjury\nAnd the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants the White House reviews are bad report which will come later this week and mark judge said he would fully cooperate right\nAh in in this investigation even though he did write another letter over the weekend mhm or to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors ... looked at this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here mhm\nUh after the Democratic party attempted to have cabinet rested on Saturday [laughter] merely officials reiterated their findings by their standards are worse charges possible would carry a with them a one year statute of limitations ... additional prosecutors were on record setting the evidence is insufficient to merit\nA basis for even a search warrant much less than the rest we shut down already before that you couldn't even get a grand a grand jury would even indict\nWith all the law enforcement bodies are well what all of the law enforcement bodies continue to point out that is a lack of time and place\nAnd while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused him three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not witnesses to any event resembling the description correct\nThe FBI or will also highly greater amounts of evidence against Dr Ford her fear of flying\nHer miss remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mysterious Safeway second door it would only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued repudiation by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her president is likely to tip the iceberg\nWhere else do you go you talked to the witnesses or and\nThen at that point it sounds so if it's done by Wednesday and it's still the same\n\nDo you see the ... I cannot see the Republicans delaying it any further\nNo I don't know that they'll have the votes um if it comes back early ah I'm I'm I suspect\nThat are that you will have further scrutiny you know and and it could be a Jeff Flake or anybody else but your ... this comes down to the votes of those people who were on the fence\nWell if they if they interviewed ... mirrors and anybody she wants them to interview\nAnd anybody who's come forward that will likely by the way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the longest\nThat likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr forge testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case there's only so far you can go\nAnd it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the testimony\nWeb but I mean politically ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just one of the Democrats can't make that\nPoint no don't try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but when they build what allowed when someone like ... did what he did\nWill will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way to just see the story to he got a little bit of publicity that\nAh the ah the weekend\nPoll that came out of the poll both as a friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn I'm I'm On tester no no no I'm In I'm In Missouri\nOh yeah well and and we wondered about a Claire McCaskill McAfee is that if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late or it could be\nPotentially we'll see I think what happens um you know later this week but I think the hesitation\nBy those senators who backed this ... you know the further investigation the FBI background check\nThen I I think politically they can be damaged even if he's confirmed you did the damage anyway you allow the circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it\nAnd we know flake is not up for reelection which is why I think it it became more convenient\nThe the other the other senators likely jumped on board a you know and and by the way they are they did so potentially up their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection\nHe had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine by the way\nFor what a two week but a part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming FBI investigation at the ... FBI investigation story from the hill the headline White House defense FBI invest\nThat out [laughter]\n[noise] they got their investigation now they're screaming about let's go to Robert in Johnstown New York Robert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show I Robert\nHi how are you guys doing real good thanks for calling [noise] I got a point but uh you asked how far this go after the interview everybody I think they should do is kinda thought there was any it'd be a lot of the woods [noise] anyway\n[noise] way we understand your we understand your point [laughter]\nSet I mean really how those two cameramen and in in a little bit over the U.S Canada in that building that's what I Want to know [noise]\nWell I it's again it was it was pretty crazy with if you if you uh were following the procedures on friday morning with the committee and then you have the Democrats walking out and then they were of course outside doing their own press conference and everything else\nSo you had a ton of chaos fight I'm with you but that's it's not I guess as secure as you would think even for senators it's not as secure as most people would think it is [noise] and that says well\nFor the Senate is it with that particular shut up [laughter]\nI Know that was the target and right up where you would be right about that would be the target yeah I mean that would be the target the thing would be looking here or I understand it does seem like your your question in your mind is seems set up huh\n[laughter] I Would have to say that and that that the flight that plagues set it up right [laughter] right oh I just I knew they bake in front of me and they made a good point and so I Do agree with them yeah and and that's where\nThe camera of it right yeah [noise] what do you think well I Am of all people have a whole ...\nAides said it's likely was getting to it's inevitable point and and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case because he has crossed the aisle so many times\nI think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming\nAnd also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum\nAnd while ultimately it didn't work um in in in moving the process forward thanks to Jeff Flake it did it did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general\nWe'll see if that translates in November at election time but uh five weeks from tomorrow by the way\nAlso but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think he's all I think it was old school I understand was the Senate's roller new advice and consent\nAnd and as you said that's why he brought up sort of my or we are I'm sure that he had problems with Kagan ... and the things that they believed ... but that isn't the job to job isn't the job is to say\nAs a senator it was never supposed to be the job of senators to say do you agree with me at every point\n\nAh no All right well then I'm going to defame your character as a justice right right but that was that was never the world to begin with it's are you confident the president gets to pick who he wants\nRight and that was that was never the the world to begin with it's are you confident the president gets to pick who he wants on the Supreme Court yeah no I don't think it was pre determined I didn't mean to imply that it was pre determined that that Lindsey Graham\nIt just happens that he was yeah a pick to do that uh it just so happens that he did do it and he really was the perfect

early in the day had reached an agreement\nWith the FCC saying and and then apparently that whatever the agreement was was going to happen to them by the end of the day there were pulling out of the

and as a publicly traded company the chairman of the boarding CEO you can't say that because you're a centrally by that statement especially if it's on true\nAnd that was the whole point is is that

think the focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court this whole thing about threatening to impeach him that's not going to happen\nNo no that's not the shock of hangs early there's nothing that's going to happen Rob the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario no doubt\nRight but I but I think a move I I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control over\nI I see what you mean yeah the the lip service that's one of the the ... in the lip service and I think that they'll continue the tax and that's\nWhat that's but that's that's the norm they call that Tuesday right do do do attack him when they were to say Supreme Court decision I don't like that when he lies on everybody already give song and on something you know it's funny because Mario but Gary and I were talking during the break\nAbout the the question by George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused\nHimself from any case involving if he ceded any case involving\nA democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yes I think that would be the\nWell in that case I can I can make the case that\nIf you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same applies and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or a or vice versa or I'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person in the\nCase [laughter]\nYou should read humans yourself because you couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defendant person making them to complain you have no standing or\nOne of the interesting Congress ... place one of the interesting conversations I got an over the weekend with a with a few other people which was\nWell how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty but is it fifty three fifty four and genders uh the the that are out there\nAnd then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of\nWhy don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders and why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about\nFour BDO row dog here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today\nWe'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of a mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nSo everything along the line of ... who paid for the the ... you know a lot of ... lie detector uh the the suggestion of a law firm everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\nAnd\nYou know they they they link or name the people that were supposed to protect her and\nThat's that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind ... as it as a dead he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that\nNow when I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole ... thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly but on friday she was being cold out\nAnd even after he decided to go to the White House basically and asked the administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor\nHe would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as I came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still\nBecause they if they believe in this to my approach it is never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left\nThey don't hail Joe mansion as somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but he's not getting them\nHe's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did all the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean after McCain was Sadler after he ran for president ... and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on Radio Welcome to the show\n[noise] hello how are you doing very good with say more bloody and board then let the gay shit I sort of like to find out a little more about this stock to school college all heard have that\nOh you mean expand the investigation on her show all upset about her fishes so hey this is this is just as bad as just shooting in Las Vegas\nWe didn't get enough that it by ear so we'll hear nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on on forward we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more\nAbout cabinet and you're going to know about Ford but it's a it's it's coming out\nMhm mhm\nWell there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember is a background check\nSo the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far ... might not be what the FBI limits themselves too\nAnd and discussing it with foreigners according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she it's still not yet been interviewed\nWell my question is\nYou're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because at the background check on him you start with Kevin ... then you're going to go into all these claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony\nYou're likely going to go and and interview maybe even family members somebody who could back it up because what you're trying to do the idea\nIs to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims so there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of\nThat can be interviewed during this process\nAnd that might not be good news for Dr Ford for her attorney\nSmaller the guy I mean are probably going to interview the guy from Yale who said no he he drank\nMore any logging are right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove it know that that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically there's this old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right\nSo we'll see where that goes\nHow do you perjure yourself on the amount that you try to you [laughter] 'cause I didn't want to buy it right now there\nWas there was no ... and there's no proof\nRight\nHasn't been asked about that specific incident right so it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point asked him about a specific\nAbout that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident ... and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk and your judgment up and compared to somebody else's judgment\nThirty five years ago there would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that now that I'm not going to happen to them\nAnd they'll they'll see they'll they will interview this person like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was\nBy that person's claim can be corroborated not just what Dr Ford claims but what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to have those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on what I radio Hi Marty\nYes I'm a first time caller here at our next Thursday in Daytona Beach but uh [noise]\nI I ...

call for this\nRight and well and here's my ... because\nRight after um flake came out others jumped on board saying yes they want the investigation too so it tells me that they went back into neutral territory there was word that came out a believe from ... camp early on that he may not be in support on friday\nThat he may not support the nomination\nI think it comes down to those four who were in

said said the same thing on Friday after if if the whole thing didn't happen I think you probably could have said that on friday that on the broad vote you are not going to get those those votes\nSo

hundred per se but it was traveling all like in there I mean\nWell I well I I Will tell you this I mean when when they said that she is credible\nLike they're on the [laughter]\nWell well I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible because she only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony that's why when anybody and I would love ... never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible how\nForget about the fact that her own witnesses you know there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names that backs her story but the fact is what she says her so\nIf you just came in and say well look how can we remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself was not credible\nMhm yeah I mean that's that's what a centrally was a place here\n\nAnd then one's even try handed a ... point and there are there any way with it yeah it's a great point they're just like knowing the question\nAre we now a ... he did say Lindsey Graham did say they're going to do an investigation on it I guess we're getting paid call for an investigation of we call

left wing locate your lawyer would have like you would have\nTo ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats I felt as ... as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to bakar up when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement this is a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it\nWhere I don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know as he did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you gave its not credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't uh somebody's asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer it just moves on\nIt's like okay give me an answer you want it look as something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of dots of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right\nBecause of their important that there's an expectation\nYep [laughter] remember\nWho ... who who wants it who asked to Obama the follow up question where was that was that ... that was here in uh in there was more or less wasn't\nOh no yeah yeah yeah well there's always separate in okay ah one where you have a local reporter here ah from WFAN a TV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be fall of ...\nThat is that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question by that that there's actually an and this was something that has to stop this ... this kind of bizarre old world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down the right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre world we're back\nBut a journalist is supposed to give\nA pilot\nBecause there is some kind of bizarre real world verse back but a journalist is supposed to give\nA politician who won't answer\nA question on an issue but as the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna be got list go away I feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at\nThem but if you're dealing it all of them and and you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with it\n\nThe ... the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the question\nNo no no but well they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question some well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just stayed it we're going to help this person build a narrative here so let's talk to them\n\nLet's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking all my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the easy\nThing to do is to challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I would've said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nYou like\nYour your your or\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did lakes is\nYou can respond to that state but if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people right at ... at least frustrate the daylights out of them ... this is why people hate
