might remember the fact that\nYou know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who was paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the leftist scared to death of Kanye West because he's smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter ...\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues that Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues of ... when you know he was up the award show where they\nKnow on the ... no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of Katrina didn't they write that that that that's not\nHis mental state when I he said that uh George Bush or hates all black people because of Katrina didn't they write\nThat that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label him as insane\n... if you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't\nKnow what are the what what do you call it the the hero voyage or what whatever Trump is on right now I'm [laughter]\nI'm not I'm not sure what that means [laughter]\nAh I I really don't know ah\nAh well I think you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of ... journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a ... a lot of Kanye West

you in one for me I think it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time\nYou know and I think in the but if you look at his demeanor and the way ... actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things\nAnd listening to them is like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Conyers talking because his demeanor was calm and straight to the point\nIt wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment after Katrina the George Bush comment it wasn't that it was something that the content of the comment\n\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\nUh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the insane comment but the insane comment is well he's not capable he doesn't have the facts of wired to do that\nWhy is the mini Troy why as anybody surprise that\nA a black man in rap mhm\nThat's been in rap now for a

woke up and realize that ... now it's not the majority ... but it's growing mhm\nAnd obviously when that message is put out to any demographic that exist out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race somebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're full of it\nRight that is just naturally going to happen and that's essentially the point that Congress made on ... you know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they ought to be a part of groupthink\n\nI mean imagine Trump had said that\nIt would be done that\nNot that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically huh it will be over CNN would have a twenty four hour

who owns that completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nNot surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I've talked about it but\nAnd we said look the big terrorists

[noise]\nA\nThroat I radio he is Eric Hi Leon I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or read I we go to Mary Ann in Michigan Marianne welcome you're on red eye Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons I said\nA including perhaps a political agenda with respect to some businesses but the thing about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here it's we create more jobs\nNo its horror married it's horrible the last thing you whatever the last thing you would ever want to do\nIs make a law that everything must be produced here because prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies that would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be\nNude and retail doors shutting wrapped and right in the opposite for\nJob would go in a massive recession if we had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nPrices of goods and services would sky rocket through the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology for the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are are are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get\nAgain because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we ... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ...\nIs that the United states is now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of\nOil in the world mhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter]\nUm and they did by the way I think that's the number one reason ... supporting a or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the thing too is that right\nSo the but but you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something about us policy put in place that doesn't need to be there\nNow and go in and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCandle I had already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was a lot of disagreed victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to what to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory and with the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that these tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost\nOf producing an automobile\nIn Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if remember two of the president's major goals his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been and TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent\n... uh and uh\nThe rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president of the case the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted an automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite\nOf the two things that you wanted a reduction\nIn the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean you if you\nIf you say it's a very populist viewpoint right we need to help the farmers but when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food uh you know set of before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world that food goes all over the world um you know and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the\nBecause forget about the political pawns president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite right because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\nWhy and ... and ... of of getting things done and as you said it was it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday yeah Sherman and and that's the other\nThing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the\nSupport of of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nBut wait\nHe was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to go she Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that well as I\nSaid and what was said you know ... and again in ...\nIndustry in order to get them to the grocery Asian done\nHe's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that or as I said you know ... and again ... we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nLike I say except for the\nYou know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually ... but the president did a lot of what we except for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall\nWas at worst the loss of business\nWith the terrorists that the president\nHas pulled on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour mhm some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight ah and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal so it must and I forgot what else said well it's only a two point five percent terror so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other thing the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states sell our vehicles overseas but that's likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his taps on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other tariffs hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that provoked Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars or with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the other states was only selling six thousand to begin with\nReaching this milestone you\nCan be a part of an elite Colombo drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills\nIf you or someone you

thought to myself\nWow you know what are they trying to sell us and our we buying it\nAnd what they were trying to sell us was um if you believe in due process if you believe in the presumption of innocence if you believe that an allegation alone\nUh especially on cooperated ... um allegations are\nAnd not only that but the witnesses that you use [laughter] don't back you up if you don't buy

weather\nThat's what they were trying to sell the American people will see in a few weeks whether a part of America bought into what they were selling the polls so far show that they have not\n\nThe other thing is we found out that the Democrats really don't have an issue\nYou go into different races and they will talk about some of the issues out there but overall if you were to ask Americans\nWhat is the issue that the Democrats are promoting what is the specific issue when you think about this election by the way has that question asked in a poll\n\nWhich question would that be specifically about what\nIs the one issue that's driving you to the polls what is the one of the major issues of this election season\n\nTrump bought office besides that what would it\nBe from that because that that wouldn't be an issue is that would just be purely political right in and it not ideology but just they dislike or hatred of Trump or you had Schumer here here's what's interesting\nUm and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you're very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I asked them questions about their friends you know it just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for them Twitter and Facebook not even on the right or not even\nBut also how things are presented to them you know one one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following weekend when she was out the house but what do you think of that I said well I don't know she goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah yeah she said I said she goes I don't know why they did that and I said well\nDo you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\nIn something that was already sad that\nJust one observation again for the fact that it's my granddaughter ... case was ... thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are but\nIs that next generation and we've seen it we've seen there are studies that show\nWell the ... the generation basically behind the the the college age or college graduates now\nIs showing more critical thinking and and not that they would be conservative but if they are assessing things for what they are instead of the

it think about it who gets to this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and death and and most definitely be going to the polls\nIn November yeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our safety and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty to hurry to yes\nI Would love to see what district that was a that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up but from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number\nA for a majority right so right now only Nineteen thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo it will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to\nBe I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those undecideds\nMore and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and that entire\nThing and really made me look at the our CPA for example I mean Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin or a three point seven five and the one before that was test her up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up said why is that definitely on the on the Senate race yeah ... right and and ... my point is so yeah is the legitimacy of the hour cp average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\nI guess historically kind of shift happened\nAh with a ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nBy the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck or they call like a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up

I don't believe that uh you know popular opinion or you know\nShould a substitute for\nUh the presumption of innocence and due process and I started thinking about it when you know you and I I said a last hour the the one thing that I got out of the whole Kevin all thing is the Democrats were trying to sell us that if you believed in due process and the mindset of due process and that's the accusation alone\nIsn't enough and you disagreed with them with this message think about this but if you don't believe the accuser no matter what\n\nIf you believe that not the allegation but the evidence is what should be the determining factor then you are an enabler although rapist about gang rape it\n\nThat's what they were trying to sell us think about that and that's why every ... when he said you know he's holding because of that that I started thinking just in our popular culture that all the different lawyer shows from Perry Mason to matlock to law and order from 'cause I think law and order started one in eighty nine or\n... I yes Eighteen eighty nine [laughter]\nBefore TV so much but you you think of all the lawyer shows out there uh-huh\nRight for that and and so when we talk about the fact of the ignorance of the

Republicans the head of the standard um\nGo along to get along they have woken up and ah I'm Wondering if this is a an apt analogy I don't know how do they inflammatory but uh in the same way that the u._s. was not aware\nThat they were under attack by a Islamic this stream is terrorists until nine eleven\nYou know they have the revolving they had the uh the ... that are in Ninety three they weren't really woke up and aware until nine eleven happened and the same way I don't like the moderate Republicans were aware that there that that\nExtreme little left wing extremism is at war with conservatism until last week\nUh nine eleven is the only reality not only conservatism just anybody who is opposite them even\nA a a poll politically yeah not necessarily any logically but no it's I don't think it's an planetary what you said because remember in the nine eleven commission\nWhich was put together a bipartisan they said the problem with the United states was they were at war with us and we weren't at war with them right uh and that was added an ad like so that came from the nine eleven commission so there's nothing inflammatory about that and and I was the word\nYour analogy I I think if you look at that I think also which I think it's correct that the Republicans many of them and the center now are clearly no I mean when you have to think about this when you have\nA Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins being the ones who were the ... that really carried if it but not so much with columns but certainly Lindsey Graham carrying the conservative torch\nThat's when you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to camp\nWhen you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to campaign anywhere and everywhere I can a purple states and everywhere else\nI think you have to include Susan Collins in in that well I knew she wouldn't there that they ought to do that will be remembered though was ... in terms of their mark\nOn this event no doubt her speech for the most part no doubt um she didn't carry she didn't carry the way I guess Lindsey Graham riot but yeah I Would ah she would do that I wouldn't have seen comic I could've seen\nIf you were to ask me maybe weeks out and told me that the situation comic\nI could've still seen as a Collins going well no I'm going to vote no and then a a high camp voting yes right mhm so I mean that that would have been or somebody if you would have told me that's what's going to happen I was like oh okay oh say\nI don't know what to even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although ... those has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy and in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating\nA a ... basically\nThe ... the ability or more and more to control pricing to keep prices low on Amazon according to ... he's the U. S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon\nThey do one or two things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nUh this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier Ga for those of you that her brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a Laufer\nPerkins Cooley who paid and opposition research from\nA ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got or information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump that they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see ... GPS was a part of it well\nThe co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nI don't really know the average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty ninth or after the lawyer said\nHis client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform\nThe lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committee\nSimpsons firmed up fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle off from that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nFusion fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course ... going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\n\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find here's either ... or they're going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a\nA who he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nOr I don't think so what are they going to ask him up finally I\nWould I Begin to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\n\nThe inspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications that they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he\nOh he but he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because it because it why they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and and again if the those are ... that's the number of it right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to call for the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut not so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce for his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still\nPreserved in any way we we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand than what I Would wonder is a\nBlend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word ... that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask his lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after right if they're not well look I ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing\nAs a mother investigation the Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with the actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know what I don't know where there was any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money from ... thrown opposition research firm that just on the level is is that what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do up as well the what they do opposition research to self explanatory so what is he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell\nAnd then finding the time it was interesting look I say this because\nDonald Trump junior I'll justify I'll do under oath I'll do there are plenty of people that go on to row mhm so what is the crime that he is more than that what is the charge\nThat blends Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going\nTo try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr if there's someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and but I taught him forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis from yes\nThose are the questions that they got those are questions on the investigator would have running through their mind desolate\nYes that's all we're not indicting anybody yet", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Waterloo", "day": "14"}
