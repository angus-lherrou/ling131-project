every one so while Democrats than others are I'm betting on\nThis will scare the American people say I want to be a good American I Can't imagine stopping these people it's pretty obvious when I look at the caravan coming our way a lot of young men and their verses women and children and that's one thing to take a look at\nBy the way well this is going on with the midterms coming to your calls in just a second\nHere's an example of how wild it's getting the Democrats\nThey are running the one thing they're running on is Republicans won you and your kids not to have health coverage to die if necessary\nThe pre existing condition argument again\nNow I've had on people that have explained I think fully that's not the Republican position at all so there is a major house race right where I Am in the Philadelphia area it's in a place called Bucks County\nBrian Fitzpatrick is the Republican Scott ... was a very wealthy guy a grandson I guess it is a great great grandson of a um\nA guy who was the vice president of the United states under FDR until he got kicked out because of how far left he was wow is is very far left so he's been prosecuting\nThis campaign saying that Brian Fitzpatrick and this is it he very hotly contested race as far as the house of representatives is a guy who essentially want you to die of laughter\nPatrick and this isn't he very hotly contested race as far as the house of representatives\nIs a guy who essentially want you to die of have to take away preexisting condition coverage and all that is the Washington Post writes a piece saying that's a lie\nAnd ... should stop saying Brian Fitzpatrick brings it up there were holding a debate on Sunday night in a synagogue now as I understand that this may be a synagogue is very liberal the Scott while I was one of their Scott Wallace is seen as the guy who's anti Israel and that is true the Democrat\nIn the middle of this Wallace can't take it anymore that pitch Patrick is using this a Washington Post story to rebut this why\nAnd he drops the F bomb\nNow this is on the is it pronounced the ... if you're Jewish synagogues beamer in elevated platform used for reading the ... the tour of during services\nAnd then the rabbi and others chastised him for this in other words he blurted out the F bomb towards this stuff from fitzpatrick while in the holiest places I understand it inside the temple\nAnd then he sort of apologize this but not really and he says he's passionate\nAnd Democrats want people that are passionate about this what have you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this guy throwing out the F bomb\nNow if I had the sound of this ... this is what ... wanted in place but a TV station may have gotten it but\nJust think about this and this is the classic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is a health care thing when even a Washington Post as the Republican did not do that would not do that it's a lie wow I Can't take it\nRight there and they you know and those are the sacred spot this guy just blurted out\nI Can't imagine is you just never have run into something like this in a circumstance like this I let me go to the cars let's go to Katie in Redding Pennsylvania hey Katie welcome in\nSitting here listening here and he and he had that kind of weight that guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nWell they said hey knocking and if I get to stay on next time I Want to play it you got to stand a Katie this guy is worth the family was worth three hundred million ... silver spoon he just came in and trying to buy his way he lives in a luxury golf course really in South Africa this candidate who came to Bucks County and people here are in shock\nIt's one thing to drop the F bomb during a debate that's hard to believe\nBut it's another to do it on the home court where you want it to be in the sacred ground of the temple\nExactly I mean in my opinion is just a few things in the world that you just don't mess with\nGod yeah one of them yes [laughter] yeah [laughter] exactly right but it's hard to believe thank you Katie thanks very much that's why I'm bringing it up as an example of when they get frustrated on the Democratic side where this is going it's David in Greenwich New Jersey hello David\nI'm thinking I might call you weren't going to go to a real estate friend of mine who does business who was there\nAnd not only I mean we're like getting to that too like the altar and the Catholic Church but not only did he drop it there but he's telling me you should have hurt him outside when he was leaving there is a shame thing this ... coming up from Mexico I'm doing the math\nAnd if you have seven thousand people times ... dollars a day to feed them let's say Mexico stand you're talking about eighty five thousand dollars a day I'm concerned that I'm bothered that depress you see these folks walking ... who's got a backpack who's got nothing who's got nothing there's there's nothing\nThat right well what we've seen radio to your point we've seen video of people and that money given that supplies and listen to this I didn't play because it's in Spanish\nA Univision reporter the translation embedded to your point with the caravan says he's met migrants from known terrorists hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh end up in this sort of a re\n[noise] um because you can walk into any part probably of South America anymore but it'd be great if the press would cover these feeding and each beating ... patients in these medical stations and then on the third point a non where I live down here is\nI can see across the Delaware Bay and maybe even twenty two miles but I can see the lights at Dover Air force base and it's it's constant a day and I reached the bombers and these these these monster transport troop trans whether it's an important transport they fly or you don't hear\nA anytime something's getting ready to happen or go down as we would say is they stop and we've had nothing now for two days okay I was pretty much tells you something is going to be going on and on the border pretty much\nSo well right endangering areas it's going to take an unbelievable number of troops to do this peacefully though but thank is actually a great point you made here's how you get in eight six six fifty Jim bow eight six six fifty gym but I Want to play you a quickly one\nMore guy this is Steve Schmidt he is the former McCain advisor used to be a moderate maybe now is full bore he's on MSNBC he's sick and buy all this here's what he says when he hears we might use the military we might be doing this at the border here is\nAh Steve Schmidt and the idea that when a mother from suffering\nThrough abuse rest and sometimes death\nAround them when they reach the border and they see a uniform with an American flag\nAnd they are no longer safe\nFor them ... ripped away and put into an internment camp\nBecause this is a moral outrage that harkens to mean worst access is in the history of the countries that are separation of families at the slave auction blocks yes to the separation of Native American families\nIt is a moral our heads and Japanese and again this is the failure of the Democratic party to interest is is a small issue not as a plus towns stain on our national water\nAs a poor family on American policy in to frame the question for the country and to file a term from ...\nWhat is that we are who are we as a people\nThat is a great question thank you for framing it now answer that we are people that are tired and you can tell me who we are do you look in the mirror and sanction is I Do we are people that are tired of the American worker the American citizen in the American population being overrun in this manner by\nA bunch of people that have gained one way or another by it\nWhile inflicting damage on countless communities countless people you know I Wonder what Steve Schmidt would say to the families like the young woman ... killed in San Francisco by a maniac who have been deported six or seven times I\nWonder what he would say to that just collateral damage just one person this is a stain on our ...\nYeah it could have been deported six or seven times I\nWonder what he would say to that just collateral damage just one person this is a stain on our national honor is it\nOr is it finally seeing someone that's going to step up on this problem that goes on day to day maybe not on mass like we're seeing\nNow [noise] but it's a similar problem that we all know was out there that's why he was elected [noise] that's what people want him to do that's what I Believe my name is ... sitting in for Jim ... here on Westwood One [noise]\n\nFrom a cedar valley through the court

I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides that looks at people's self interest it all depends what your self interested that's Ibota myself into a site I vote for my self interest me much might [laughter]\nMuch was my it it really didn't work out for me this last shouldn't we since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan no but what is my what is my bigger ...\nMy my bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff no my self interest is freedom\nWell when we have the liberty of it and then and and the ... of of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest is so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people self interest is\nGive me free stuff mhm that's not my first self interest because I Know that it's a bogus concept I Know but it doesn't work I Know but it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to cure\nAnd so they're simply selling to people who believe in\nDon't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about the deficit or the debt\nEither side now doesn't care about it\nIs completely and totally irresponsible both Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo ... for both sides now keeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure keeping the status quo of what we get from the government\nI Can't tell you when the banks are getting bail out how many people called up and said there shouldn't be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money well from somebody else and that's\nWhere the shift was from you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservative or voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the uh the the end of the Bush presidency\nOr that the world was coming to an end to remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world\nYou know because the world was coming through and that\nUh but the that that a a fear\nDrove a lot of people after the bailout started happening\nTo say well listen you know that's going to happen then great I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect right the government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money to throw it to me not throw bank right through throw it to me we were saying no throat which no one right when\nAnd he looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they're if they're thrown out money throw it to me not throw bank right to throw it to me and we were saying no throw which no one right way and and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life\nThey become a ... and everybody understands this when you take it out of the hardest and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right sure healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats just to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for Ken Ken you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nAnd you know already got response whenever we talk about your health care well other countries spend less on health care\nNo they don't know not for the same services they don't know\nWe can't make that correlation you because you can't compare you can't you can't compare it if waiting times are double for some procedures that tell chair and ... exact timely healthcare is if you talk to my my my cousin out of Ontario mhm back Twenty years ago\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college loan\nUm those are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work\nOr does it really effectively work with their particular situation and then on top of that\nOr does that interest me if if I'm really thinking about a generation who was having fewer\nKids there's the book or plan even resonate with them ... were kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family\nI'm giving my children the debt well yeah I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not a oh wait a minute\nBut\nThe thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I Need you ... dollars a year exact and help with raising my child go now that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college or home and all this all these items well no no no no no no you're you're not\nYou're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know wouldn't be parents votes right now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promising me six thousand dollars if she gets elected to have it out with my kid ... I Want to end the thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes as onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free healthcare yes Medicare fail to it yeah\nSo the what you can get ... get my kids here Fifteen thousand I Know I'm not having kids fifty thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now all the way it will give me ... well no give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars\nGive me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid can use down the road right now I Want it now and gave me a now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that then\nYou're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult boat they don't care about the future they care about now\nSee they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not doing big enough or you're not going direct enough\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on ...
