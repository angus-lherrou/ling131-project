is a U.S representative Neal done ah speaking well what a day at a what a day it was I Know a you and I work communicate back and forth watching the weather channel in other news channels that were uh\nUh uh you know are covering the landing of a of hurricane or Michael and I think in most of the you know the video that we saw in and I knew what when we when you know and I'm sure you didn't we were watching it\nWe weren't seeing the major damage that was being done in some of those areas because for example in Mexico beach and nobody was there filming\nRight you because you you just couldn't be there they wouldn't show that um you know the the the conditions as a Michael Caine mature on uh with with a a a very strong at a very strong category for\nUh you look at a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and and just incredible I mean just look at the time span from last weekend up until a it the storm arrived\nUh the unpredictable nature of these storms and ... and how Michael gain strength and was still gaining strength I ... if\nIf the storm hadn't been moving as quickly as the as it was had it slowed down at all over water\nOr there's no telling I mean there's a I'm I'm confident this thing would have been a category five began to I mean it was it came close to it anyway\nA mile a mile per hour away Riley yeah from from getting to that to a point and I they did say later on you know the analysis of it they could you know\nA revisit it say that it was a fiber why lower for right ah I said when they when they get all the you know a data from all the instrumentation ... uh they they could still update it but how uh\nHow terrifying it must be a whole blaming all I've seen so far still report I haven't checked in about twenty minutes last time I checked only one death so far tribute to right and that was a hurricane Michael and that was because of a fallen trees there may be more people but right just as at the moment just one\nWell end to end the clean up a ... as you just heard the representative talking a you the clean up its gonna it's gonna take weeks months or I\n... is that this is ridiculous and as we've said when you when you think about it I I understand why they're going there because where else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country than we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you were you were going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this so we are I don't know last week\nThere is no but I Do you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back reverse direction will you we said that two letters again really well and and you know when we set it after the election\nUh you because there is that at once they took that break and you know are considered going to the mid west for a moment [laughter]\nThey came back from watching my weight but are we said before lunch oh we're totally not do not I don't I Can't do in that we're not doing that um but when you when you go you know back in and look at the history of of basically this this ramping up to this point\nThere at it there at this point now now ask yourself do you think they're going to reverse course they're not going to so what is next\nWhere do you go from here\nUh we've been asking that and every time they find a new place to go to because just now they're going to get in your face not going to shout well what is what is beyond that right\nNow I Believe it's a terrible political strategy that's going to backfire it is I think it's already backfire and ah but yeah this this is where they've decided to go which uh again\nI'm not surprised because once they're only as we'll talk about this more coming up on the show with a bit later on but there were only two places to go right either moderate may become more centrist and really become more centrist ... or go to the left and if you go to the left the only place to go is

J. H. G. ah which did streaming coverage um um basically when when we went\nOff the air they started their streaming coverage and then continued until they lost\nMore than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites and that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above sea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe in that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board\nTo make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station in our system through ... element in the garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because wedding basically did was documented where he was\nWhere he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the to the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I'd just be a travesty is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a wing or early Wednesday and uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing\nYou know the well a calm literally calm before the storm\nAnd and ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope for periods of time thirty to forty minutes even shorter times\nBut then as you mentioned by going live later and this is something that again and it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us\nThat have never been through the storm and very few people relatively speaking\nHad been through a storm like this but when you're able to\nShow people how powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way he anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows it's going to be next to impossible to get out of that parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind\nAnd that's what you hope to do you hope to show people that this damage and how powerful this storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical ... Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar a Tom this thing right now a Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas what are we expecting next and the next twenty four to forty eight hours and be on\nWell initially what we're going to expect his life [noise] you know there there are still is a life threatening storm surge going on um to begin with a Panama City and along the coast there they still are anywhere from three to five feet a inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a near the water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia the Carolinas and they don't need any more water\nRight there still saturated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would not necessarily be out of the question to to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five and not\nA ... and we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise]\nUh the wins a high profile vehicles were twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a a Seventy mile an hour\nWind and within the next half hour they're going to update that\nWith a with an advisory they were giving one hour advisories this was the last invite history at twelve o'clock eastern time\nThen we'll be moving on to uh just regular a three hour advisories\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed as it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing\nA probably not by the time or off the air but twenty three miles an hour [noise] forward speaking to the northeast and when I was still going to be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour [noise] and\nSo now above the surface where we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet when some been already clocked I'm\nUsing Doppler radar [noise] uh at that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms and there is one currently caught crossing over highway sixteen which goes into making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there and\nThat thunderstorm translates those higher wins to the surface and so in those storms that they could seeing us two eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at in a sustained speed of Seventy miles an hour\nSo we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five\nOf the speed of wins above the surface and and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states or as we get up to\nFriday morning out into the Atlantic as a\nAs a tropical storm about\nSome we're not it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a in a general direction John trout and great meteorologist ed ... a lot [noise]\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's going to be following the car door although it will be on the west side of that car door and we've already learned that the west side of that court or\nAs some some some roots that are between Colombia and Ninety five and moving its way up toward Charlotte in Rockingham and so forth that are\nThat have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across lumber to them and say Advil\nAnd both of those areas um south of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh those areas are are we're gonna have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow\nYou're right past Raleigh those areas are are we're going to have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow [noise] uh the see if we have more catastrophic flooding ... we can probably we can probably say for the next time we talked about turning around and don't drought\nRight right exactly ... and and you have to you have\nTo proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of the water you it's impossible to tell about so and it's always best to turn around and certainly a we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale\nAnd later John ... will also joined us uh and and keep us updated what to expect a in the coming days thank you Tom we'll talk to you here and just a myth\nSounds good All right thank you eight six six Ninety ...

debate better and put your points are for better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane I mean right now they're just insane and so people you know they look and they say okay\nYou know we're what's what's McNamara saying today okay I disagree with that but ah he's not insane like they are over there I really think that sort of a [laughter] when you you know you if you're you're comparing him here say okay what about ... what do I compare you too\nAnd when you see that the opposition isn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion\nThat I think more people are just open then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to an opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's rational thought and critical thinking to it\nMhm right well and and they have we and we do hear that from time to time but I don't agree with everything but I mean I understand\nHow you get there a central right mhm and we've had over the years we've had plenty of great discussions with Democrats liberals who call and want to have a sane discussion on the issues\nBut ...\nThey're few and far between if they exist at All right now because I don't know what they're looking at their party\nAnd asking well how do we actually win something and then move forward when you think about the word progressive\nTough that's the whole idea right I'm taking the country to its next step that's a great point they're still using progressive don't thanks so well you know that there's no way you can when they're saying get in your face and shot him out on the building\nThat's progress\nThe answer is it's not it's it's the opposite of progress\nI think the key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks and then what is just come to this week\nWith the proclamation that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we you know to win an until we win shows that they have come to the realization that they cannot defend their own arguments that are on the substance of the ideas they are lost\nAnd it's just pure range and emotion over what I don't know I Can't figure out a I tend to believe that we think in a in a critic of the critical thinking way and they're just pure rage and emotion and there's no way to even have a debate right eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips

numbers that are up in New York Times doing their old with Oceana college are you ready for some of these yeah what are we got her cook okay we gotta we ... we got a little over ... yes okay a\nTexas Senate okay from New York Times ... fifty two percent or forty three wow yeah\n... that's I think that's the widest margins so far of a new poll I if I if I\nRemember correctly Tennessee black burn fifty five percent\nAnd then you would look the hearing that entire week of discussion and and craziness\nAnd then vote this last Saturday as you mentioned that's really the the period you want to look at and of course after that what changed if anything change the minds of ah the voters\nAnd which voters which group the Democrats as you mentioned\nNot you can't find one that's getting a real bump but there are a couple of Republicans that seem to be getting something from it is enough to win is it long lasting will stay there until election day well keep in mind a couple of things first of all\nA within a couple of weeks you can start seeing early voting\nAnd those that are motivated will have that when you see early voting numbers\nAre that are up that means people are really motivated and very anxious chomping at the bit to get out and vote\nNow and the the the New York times poll I guess there's still continuing their goods called allied poll on the one in Texas right so they they start doing it again tomorrow but as of right now and that's the woman had Ted Cruz up by nine now you've seen cruise up consistently uh you know in their ... I\nI look I I still believe Texas has different animal and probably wouldn't be the same\nAs as other states I I Believe that that uh if cruise wins if Crist wins by you know double figures yeah I think he would have always won by double figures irrespective of the cabin our race yeah I I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in the primary one\nOr twenty sixteen he won the state um do you look at a also now look there was a period where especially right around the convention time [noise] plenty of people in the Republican Party didn't like Ted Cruz remember the uh there was he got he bowed right and and [laughter] and the word\nFrom Capitol Hill I mean he was being demonized by fellow Republicans are at one point\nSo this is someone attacked cruises someone who gets the benefit\nI think maybe a to a greater degree as than than others\nOf the Republicans coming together after the capital thing when there's a juggling within the party than someone like Ted Cruz who's been criticized by his own party\nYou know the then he's going to get he's going to get that bump a little bit more or the benefit of that a little bit more uh than than others might\nSo I I'm it'll be interesting I think to to really watch this next three weeks three and a half\nAnd a house race as we can tell because there's the you know look at it and the polling or they don't do a lot of polls for a lot of these house races and so you really don't have an indication now\nI'm sure inside their campaign they do because they're doing the inside the inside polling but you you know that's one of the complaints you and I were having their own power Mitchell meeting there are a little while ago saying ... really can't tell because the no polls in three weeks ... internal poll in two weeks you look at the\nToss ups the number of districts right now that are that are classified as toss ups are categorized as toss ups\nThirty two according to our sleepy\nAnd they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do for the Senate seats and I have to wonder what has changed after the Kavanaugh hearing and confirmation vote and I have to wonder again in those districts\nKeep in mind a number of those districts\nOr the race is is on\nTo fill a seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out\nAh what does that mean is the makeup of that district changing and we look at Texas thirty two ah that is a ... a Pete Sessions\nOr the the demographics in in his district or change\nYou know um that's that's something that well changes politics and it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all of his Dallas County and Dallas County has gone balloon and well gosh going back to a\nObama and two thousand eight so for a decade\nOr Hillary won in fact that district or buy a point and a half and I believe it was\nA so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions as he right now is only a while and it was a poll in late September by one point\nBut he's been you know he's been somebody who has been as a strong contender and years ago you would think well that's not going to change it does change in those districts when the demographics change\nI'm you know one of the things and and again you look for any type of barometer out there to see if you know the whole cabinet thing had you know well what kind of ... it's going to have an impact it's what kind of an impact is going to have ... and and uh I look at Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie Cook came out the other day and and uh\nAlso ... has now said it's a toss up our sci fi says it's a toss up\nTester's been up uh in July was up by three ... and early September he was up by two by late September he was up\nBy four but that was the latest poll ended nine twenty two right at ... up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens in you know that state as we get closer ah a Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent\nIn any of the the polling ah a he is he is just over\nThe margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his um\n[noise] a ... for example he was a plus for and that was a margin of three point seven margin of error and it was up by three that was march of two so he's over but now it's a Senate race it listed as a toss up\nAnd the question is in a in a place like mine Tana\n\nConservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana mhm\nAfter everything that we have seen and and not just Kavanaugh but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played everywhere they you know and but we plan on yesterday show that comment is I'm\nOn the former attorney general ... are being played\nToday show the comments I'm\nOf the former attorney general ... are being played you know a well if they go low will kick 'em from Eric Holder mhm\nThey're being played or the you know CBS News story I mean even the mainstream media picking up that Democrats have said they're not going to take the high road instability now is there a politics of choice by the way have Sarah Palin said if they go low will kick 'em oh it would be the number one story\nAnd the mainstream media right so you you see the strategy that they have which is not a strategy of expanding their base because it's not\nClaiming you're going to be you know on civil claiming that\n... claiming as we said during the whole Kavanaugh thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message it came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else but didn't agree with them is if you if you believe the mindset of due process\nAt a presumption of innocence urine unable as the ... a a a rapist and that's what you do mhm\nThat's the message that they set out I I ...\nIf that's a great selling point in America today than we certainly are doomed yep\nIf that if you believe that gives you an advantage and it does in an election then you're right we're heading down the wrong path and we we are doomed as we've always doing away with civility wins in America it will prove may right eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n... must be
