Pennsylvania\nWell Lisa I can answer that question for you I don't know if the sports illustrated people ever got around to reply to you I can tell you a very simply why their coverage was one page and a few photos and that's because nobody watches the WMBA [noise]\nBecause it has very low attendance at any time it's on TV which is sporadically of the ratings are terrible the WNBA exists only because the NBA the gas ... male league has chosen to subsidize it\nAny women's independent basketball league has gone under\nAnd when I find particularly interesting though is is the language that was used shameful and appalling you should be ashamed [noise]\nNow I'm not that concerned about coverage of women's basketball I Am concerned about people out there who seem incapable of anything that is reasonable perspective about things with which they disagree shameful and appalling\nWhen it's not always a bad notion and even if in fact you feel that there is something that is wrong and doesn't require you to become totally out raised and indignant about everything and as we go to some calls let me know one of the problems is becoming outraged about everything if you become outraged about everything\nWhen can you actually show outrage you've taken away your main weapon if you save outraged for genuinely outrageous ... people notice you what is your outraged all the time nobody knows is oh\nJohn or Jane they're outraged again we don't even pay attention after a while John in Seattle calls and believe me John welcome\nHey Jim yes\nMy take on this or is it I think it's tragic that a young lady that's Eighteen year old today that goes to four years of college whether it's higher institution of public or private\nThere's this constant drumbeat on campus that all men are evil that you always have to be looking over your shoulder but how does that spirit Perry a way to go out in the world and have good social skills to make a living to raise a family\nI mean it's it's almost like it's the Victorian area you know it's like there's this real narrow defined idea that this is how men and women are and that this is how\nYou have to relate to the opposite sex I mean it's just so narrowly defined it's just like a throwback to Victorian\nWell in many ways it is which is which is ironic because of course many of these people are rather a rather liberal gene it in their views about a a things though that the upset the victorious but in terms of of being easily offended some of these people come forth like they are one giant wrong nerve ending\nIt and I I get I I think I Want to hear some of these ...\nUsually offended some of these people come forth like they are one giant Ron nerve ending it and I I get I I think I Need some of these people that I could say a good morning America where do you mean by that [laughter]\nI Know it's a it's supposedly a liberal approach but it it's more like a really\nReally a really conservative Victorian I mean it's so narrowly defined about how men and women are supposed to be able to one another so anyway that was my thought on it you have a good night\nShow Thanks John appreciate your thoughts one eight six six five oh

happen\nYeah manual going around ... is a long day by day they are eight than they are killing them read to them they're not really in a worse situation and it's on the ... some of these women\nWell in some cases I I Will I don't know that I can get down to a comparison let's say of a of rape versus an accusation of rape or an accusation of rape unfounded would be a terrible thing uh being raped I have no idea what that would be like and I'm very glad that I I bring Noah\nNoah ... empathy if you will to the subject is not something we most of us want to be familiar with but I certainly see your point lives and and I mean like Anthony\nAnd on on demand not want to go on telling me moving more rain and I sympathize with the band and my I mean it's wrong I like it steam average for them but they have nowhere I taking it out on on and\n[noise] well it certainly is not a a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were to say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nWell of course everybody would put down that notion of what you're saying all women are liars\nAgreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nIn which a there are charges against men and suddenly all men are pigs I'm Sorry that doesn't hold up either every case is different every case is different and has to be judged on its own circumstances in bed I think is the message that we should be getting across your along with the

breath here on the cabin up they you know because all of it the rest of it will really go way they're gonna try and make this thing last until about four weeks from today but it's not it's not resonating with\nThe American people well I've got a question here why would you and and the Democrats still keep pounding impeachment ... that we're going to impeach now anybody who knows how the the system works and let's say they took the house they could impeach him\nThat doesn't mean he's out of office so that simply an impeachment mhm\nAnd then in you're never going to pass the Senate you would need two thirds mhm so it would never pass it's never happened in the history of the country so it's not going to happen so why are you doing it because you're motivating the Republican base\nRight keep shouting at though pleas for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nThree days who steady rain and you're going to be looking at the dangerous situations pretty much anywhere and that's what we got today flash flood watch in effect for portions of Texas in through Oklahoma Kansas portions of eastern Nebraska\nIowa Minnesota and Wisconsin\nBrought up and down I thirty five and portions of course\nI've forty I Seventy five ten from LA to Texas dry bug from central Texas to Florida I turn will be wet today mainly from that system known as Michael landfall expected tomorrow but heavy amounts of rain for Florida later in the week Georgia and South Carolina\nThat's it is that uh you know just kind of\n... look ... if you look if you go back to the history of ah of Brock Obama's political career\nWho he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the community organizers special him in the Chicago area oh it can mean in a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means um you know for politically or for any area not just Chicago but getting people to the polls\nThey they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they owned that better than the Republicans in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it in two thousand eight\nAnd then two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls be the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and Brock Obama President Obama at that time and the polls showed that Mitt Romney\nOr on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yet and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization that's what happened in twenty sixteen\nThe RMC had been working in the DNC didn't see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know 'cause we're still are Russians and all that uh but they are and see\nWhere they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed it ah after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote\nThat model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and that's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw\nAnd it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing\nThe organization you know that she's trying to speak of it it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the vote is one thing\nThe Democrats though has had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on\nThe other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion you know and and not you know to look the other way with a Joe mansion in certain cases and and not really worry about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\n[noise] the\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact\nI don't think the Democrats are the party would want it to change because on many issues ah they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it which includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do\nOh and she was saying that we need to organize for the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know while whipping up the votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate\nWill that happens all the title ... that that stating a are nothing new the other thing is when now you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you\nMay not believe that she is and she isn't right now but the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on precedent in television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nFor the day he has he has said you know they ... the leader of the DNC is basically said she's the ... she's the future right I mean\nShe may not she's not the leader of the party right now but if she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason the media turns to that is because they see what's going on with the left by the way uh you know from the outside in\nWho who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leaving the Democrats well it's it's overall if you were to term it collectively it's the protester it the extreme\nLeft but what's the problem with that is that\nHow many different protests are they're the reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and they are a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Brock Obama to campaign for I'm In Texas is because\nThey're so over you and it doesn't matter who you are\nOr you meant it though you know what's gonna happen if\nIf for clues as Obama's going to come out and say he should've used my endorsement well that's what he was he a party will say reach I he reached my endorsement shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's a endorsement but really I mean I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago so you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember\nThe the political I dollar tree that for\nPresident or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was\nAnd I look at it today now out of it now you are our goal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ... nah we don't want to hear yours after he's out now we don't want him white made\nBecause and and that's it what what a Casio courthouse doesn't include here is internally ex terminally\nThe political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside uh that's of course it does and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans have if the Republicans were jailed last year or as the president ah took office in\nJanuary of twenty Seventeen like uh they are now after Kavanaugh than we probably would see if they were jailed on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely\nBut that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being a president in in in one ear and then gone and the next\nWell with the left\nThe problem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go in are you going to be with the feminists are the transgender Z because you can't on their boat\nRight now they're fighting with each other ... as we predicted\nRight three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and indoctrinate in children and and and young people to believe that it was\nThat it's white to wake up today and find a new oppressor find a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody that was with you and part of your group yesterday\n[noise]\nPresident Obama or just not really into any more\nYeah I mean I Would have wanted was speaking engagements and that but that Iran take our thinking about\nIt shows you how the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow in one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime and make it so he's not even relevant two\nYears after he's out of office yeah not even ... years are running right from him saying bad don't even don't need as endorsement here than that because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the science\nBecause the left believes he truly what's into liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause\nHe was and it just because of the gig\nRight but he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover as far left as they thought\nThey did more than ... his own party as closely as as many

McNamara welcoming good morning [noise] you know we can do we can buy a whole bunch of different topics do you have a share okay guy even you know we just talked to John trout about\nHurricane Michael of a coming in we had a discussion on on on Hurricane Florence ... you and I talked to briefly not we didn't spend a lot of time on it about\nThe Washington Post paste remembered that said the Trump Administration was complicit remember that in right in a in Hurricane Florence and uh you know we talked about you know the rest of the president\nDoing something on that but all we're really not sure but allowing the the the increase to happen initially ethanol was supposed to be about reducing global warming until they found out from farm to tank it actually produces more global warming gases\nBecause of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president doesn't even bring up global warming is just with the government needs to get involved in this in order to help farmers right mhm um\nAnd then we have the United nations\nComing out and saying we're doomed\n\nBecause of global warming yeah we are uh you have a Al Gore traveling the United nations as well that we have twelve more years yes we'd twelve years now I I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah yeah yeah I never was or what\nYes we've twelve years now I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah yeah you ever was or what this twelve years they mean it\nAnd so so how do we solve it well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax on carbon dioxide admissions would be neat to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the\nEnd of the century to effectively limit global warming ... ... means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax on gasoline in that year\nHuh now should such a recommendation be adopted death in twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as fifty five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars per gallon\nGas tax\nBy twenty thirty well then the experts we'll be right cars won't be on the Republican Party thirty and if they won't be anywhere\nI won't be able to get it on my desk could have little centrally be a paper weight\nOr ... you know and so all of a sudden we're back to you know global warming again as we said we're just a a a few weeks ... uh you know before a midterm election so the Democrats got to bring out the old standby\nThen they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they called go home and drink and some of the wall Street Journal here factor in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damage by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths same vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increase wet lands to handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies that encourage building\nIn vulnerable areas and mentioning that every news site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence\nMr home and said major storms have become events\nThey afford great footage which feeds a false sensation viewers at storms have become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with aid because CNN is not present\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon reduction is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards living rationally\nA top are possible he said they could begin with Congress quad defined for the American people how much they are forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know here it again after a hurricane Michael mhm uh again the blaming of President Trump oh sure and that's why like I said during lumbering if you want to check out his stuff\nUh he writes some great articles and he does believe again or he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it but he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong book do we have an interest act interesting perspective how do we have an impact of course we have an impact\nBut we're part of his life cycle here on this planet yes I Do as people always ask what do you think and I said I don't own neither do you write again I don't think anybody really knows you can take a guess but the average Joe on the average Joe I'm not a\nA you know atmospheric science a scientist but uh from what I've read they don't know because the predictions are always wrong\nMhm there are things that we could measure in the past that aren't necessarily part of the global warming thing but you talk the talk of them in terms of pollution\nParticulate matter yeah I can you want yeah you can quantify these are things that we can measure and we can understand the problem is is when you see policy especially the cost of government which keeps creeping up\nA that is put on the American people ah with out that kind of of evidence and discussion I mean again pollution you can measure you

they started replacing out without ...\nYou can't have two hundred group alcohol it tiger Scott it absorbs moisture from the air show most you're going to get it's like maybe one Ninety five Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel land\nHowever alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy right around him as a gasoline does

also for uh the anti knocking capabilities that's not what a ... percent exists\nNo the temper send mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah waiting overlook we've not our problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry down all that kind of monopoly the great government dictates\nAll right you need to do this for the what's the reason Oprah global warming but what's the reason now to make sure you have a job for radio row dog who's your forecast\nHurricane Michael as a category one hurricane slashing Cuba and is now forecast to be a dangerous major hurricane when it smacks the U.S Gulf Coast tomorrow according to the national Hurricane Center\nForecast indicates Michael May be a category three hurricane with wins from between one hundred eleven to one hundred twenty nine miles an hour when it strikes life threatening storm surge is almost imminent along\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded Goldman couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why would it go to the inspector general and all the sudden it was Doug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what\nIs to investigate corruption there you get it the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this and tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can ...\nYou you that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence ear CIA director and a you're a you're a a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director ... you know good to secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to\nTo to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are the allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the and we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at this\nBut yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you're looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the department of justice then you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said they ... they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of of Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fodder misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud or around during the election and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a John Bolton in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff Kelly is well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information by classifying it and we see the on redacted information here if we jumped to the conclusion well first of all\nThe executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office fry you would start with Michael Horowitz said the only way because beyond that\nYou're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played it would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do hear\nThink about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even\nThat could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee\nBy the president right while our air supposed to be autonomous and you know ... or which\nIs someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's a key to opening the door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly on top of that you add\nThe fact of what the inspector general is designed to do in the ... report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report\nOr on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nYou're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation or was handled into and then parlayed into the Russian investigation and all of that\nNow when you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact I'm the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information so now\nBe outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information so now ... having already done the investigation\nOn the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation now has all that work done the legwork done there to possibly lends support to this new investigation um and it's I think\nInteresting and I think very key that the president turned it over the Horwitz and basically washed his hands\nUp at four now and I think it's an important member Giuliani has been saying that he believes of perjury happen that you had somebody in the FBI verify 'cause that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claim they're familiar with the matter a believer in and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that\nHe believes there is possible perjury in the fact that\nAh the Pfizer warrant and the supporting documents for the Pfizer warrant that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research and when the when everything was a redacted accent me on redacted\nWhen everything was opened up and declassified so everybody can see it bold how they got the Pfizer warrant application their surrounding documents the three oh twos and\nThe communications between the higher ups of the FBI that somebody in the administration said don't release us Mr President because if you released this it'll be viewed as political you solve with Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released in what they want to really solve it\nNope if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed 'cause you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... ... there's some being extremely wrong or crimes have been committed\nAnd you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unwritten pact that evidence so you have but he can go look for anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case\nHe has access to the documents that the that the ... the oversight committees could not get from the FBI there is no process that stopped\n... from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nNow I Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI have tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even leave him vulnerable to accusations\nBut he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information on other major episodes in American history from the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider\nA any does the the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year I'm Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the footnote really had garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report can be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking impossible linked to the Trump campaign\nNot a reporter or policymaker would have better than eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke this story John Solomon\nBut Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat\nIn an unclassified setting that he had met him at the top lawyer at the firm representing the DNC and received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking\nIt was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that funded the unverified salacious dot CA by the British intel operative Christopher Steele that became a central piece of evidence\nUsed to justify the FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying here's another example again at\nThe FBI and the department of justice these these things aren't top secret it's out of our national defence felt it's about covering their ... their ears otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it in a non classified setting that was the point [noise]\nSo are there you go just a little bit of an update on there and we will keep we keep you updated on it because we believe it's the most important unreported story really in the mainstream media today and that's it and things to say or a quarter and Solomon and some others\nThe print edition preferred by Ninety percent of boat your drivers is now available for free as an F.

showing and I and I do believe this is something the Republicans need to work on and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice\nAnd I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court\nIt's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's the liberals who wish to put on judges who will pass legislation versus not conservatives who wish to pass\nConservative legislation it's originalist construction is also that they've been called but originally we want to stick to the original text of the constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea but saying liberal\nThe constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut saying liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication but it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative\nThe kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not change it changing the constitution is up to a or changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process and it's that simple and we need to\nAs conservatives\nOr we need to and libertarians we need to promote that\nThat it is we the people who are elected representatives they need to be making the law\nAnd not abandoning the constitution and having a judge's become legislators\nThe ah\nThe was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day yeah it was the friday heading into Labor Day weekend and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about washing collusion no it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump I watched the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue and you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at you earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always used that even though at the same time the American people have said we don't care\nYeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations or the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well uh you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups or or you know a ... or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming bound you haven't made your case\nTo the vast majority of America let me go get a burger I is I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said\nAre they doing this on purpose\nBecause I actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy 'cause remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nFrom it wasn't even a just a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you know what's what's the Democrats issue what are they actually going to use besides\nImpeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nLouisiana two thousand two thousand sixty\nDemocrats try some self restraint\nNow I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional [laughter] I thought it was a stray [laughter]\nUh it's not certain the Democrats I'm just wondering parts of it because I actually started laughing during a it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm uh I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice Kavanaugh\nAnd the swap with Clinton their positions Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president's unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on his public duties this has more\nMakes the president's unfit for office while Republicans insist his private morality has no impact on his public duties this is more a than a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base and make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats have an alternative\nThey can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to enact the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead to search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they will win over ...
