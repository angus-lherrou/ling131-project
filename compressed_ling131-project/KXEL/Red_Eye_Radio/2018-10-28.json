McNamara eight six six Ninety\nRead I welcome and a good morning I'm I just I just want to address an email that I got yesterday because um\nIt was just too good because we we were talking about economic things yesterday and we're talking about uh the reason they know the corporate tax mhm and and as we said before I keep forgetting we always get the listeners but but uh I'd made the comment as we've made before\nThat corporate taxes hurt the poor the most and this person just wrote me just completely baffled by what do you mean those are the corporations I had to explain to them\nNo or\nYou pay everything that a corporation is when you see is financed by the consumer\nYeah everything right or their their their profits are financed by you\nEverything's financed by by private money to pay their taxes right the the taxes to corporate taxes are paid by you the consumer your the consumer pay for their expenses because if you if you if that's not the case they're gone right so a corporate tax is they dealt tax on the consumer you don't see it directly\nAnd therefore what does it hurt the most who has the least expendable income the poor\nFor cobra electronic here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south Gobi drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dried this weekend\nFocus on those but beyond that build the momentum forward and you know I've got a couple of emails from yesterday's show you know in talking about well you think the people who are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and blah\nBlah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with them they hold on a second you missed part of the conversation we're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle\nThat win elections for you right that's who you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially\nTo put it in the president's ah you know we'll house to shoot my customers\nBy the by the way I don't know I I answered the the one email from a one woman who wrote that\nThe the the one that because it sounds like that's when you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll go to my mind and in the end and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look I'm Talking about you arrive yeah this is going to change it I'm not talking about my ... I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not\nThat it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across\nAnd if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not the right there early now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have ...\nYeah more seats instead of losing seats and this was back then not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group the the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now or they're capable together of getting real things done than they need to get our message out there but there is this\nAn and we continue to to fight this all the time or we will get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody now we don't know\n... that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and I said you know I used to think this way\nAnd then I started all you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their mind you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it and we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way a nation\nThat largely remains and we're not talking to you who are so clean to show you have sawdust out you sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nThat the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people right if you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou kidding me if you liked or just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an Tom [laughter] it's always on high scenario it's like doing kinds of yoga all the time at a table isn't\nOh it's like sitting on a beach so like that just sitting there and\nSay I I got friends in St Thomas sending their version island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after\nDay here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with then you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no that's not our goal look\nGo after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing this wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric is ... doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mass of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on\nAlready what frustrates me is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand that on you know the other side on on the side that I'm most closely relate to\nThat it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated is hell mhm we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand four\nOr to him becoming president and two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night Nevada bill ... who vote 'em all out almost big was it because it became if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you\nWhat I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater Brock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win the ... ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay can you can you\nCan I ask her mansion and as we said a total lack of substance on\nActually hitting the the the issues that's the difference\nLook at you know we've talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side and but I Do understand that because some political ideology\nIt's a different look at you know we talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side nut I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality in on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate could still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nThat are you that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said it saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day from what you saw was the shell\nOf the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas

X number one you know he's got three branches or the all three branches of\nGovernment I'm like oh I bet you first right presidents come and do\nA okay yeah I'll tell you what the book is we're short on time John I'll tell you what can't be reversed only have a two year construction is on the Supreme Court good point yeah\nExcellent point yeah and I don't I ... I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim that we stayed at\nWell I Believe that did about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the all the answers\nI'll make this from John John John John Saddam we said that the president and the Republicans are making progress than they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah and I made about long lasting or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could defeat you on that because I pointed out uh with you know Kavanaugh Anne Gorsuch you have to construct yeah you're right on the Saturday\nOr a knowledge of that right and we want we ... we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch should we look at Obama most of what Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you use executive orders ... uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well\nAnd and here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember right almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent well I I I Know I it was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last of ministry ... tried they tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges\nAnd the business by the state we just we didn't make that statement today that well president what President Trump said or has done we'll be long lasting non parts of it will\nYou know so it it's just because the problem is with with if\nYou're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah there's ... there's an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the set\nWas Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline ... that the powder that was sent along with all the time you know a along with\nThe suspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that that\nThe narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that\nAnd\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible more as a time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us at ... they're saying the bomb was harmless but this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off\nA ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off for where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or her they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask the right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are\nWhen we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the person or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter]\nWe're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of so they believe it's the same you know right people are ... or group of people based on the material which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\nYeah if you look at the nature of ah how this was said uh the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr a you know the multiple stamps that went through us ts um each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male uh usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a great deal of resources the secret service has a great deal\nOf resources and ... and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle there's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know they may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from\nWhat I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bombs or not they know right having said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered\nBy a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\nWell because in in in and I know is is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well and if they were\nArmed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York\nUh to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building that CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock sometime that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off then and you suspect that there might be more\nWould you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nUh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that's the if the threat is real enough that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we knew we were seeing the pictures on on a online and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety ...\nSomebody else was guilty of my time to record his head on the radio [noise]\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to shovel tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shoveled tell us what matters is inside\nTo learn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can't you never know when you may need some help too that's truckers fun dot org ... band together for a better tomorrow\nProfessional drivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month\nJump opportunities for owner operators his easy to spot with a hot right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside\nSign truckers connection and job opportunities free at ... traveled centers of America we'll pills and other truck stops nationwide truckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass just got easier\nVoice of eastern Iowa\nUsed ...

while bing yeah one of those out there all day so but I guess you\nCould write a twelve days are away from uh the uh the mid term elections\nI went out and early voted yesterday uh uh went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me right it was pouring rain or just pouring rain mhm and when\nIt was funny 'cause I've never even though this campus is only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been never drove through this community college right I'll go through what the science Rob front of the you know the that you you could tell me okay this is early voting political signs all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know what when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they didn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse right uh where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles and I was going to go there and I said\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot\nAnd to go there and I said nah I Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot ... pouring rain but when I uh got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ...\nOutside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how ya doing everybody's laugh and joke in what's going on all you're doing and they had the the the new don't didn't have to actually sign\nYou know how you're supposed you sign you know that okay so ... you don't sign any more you sign on a tablet ignoring the tablet around you sign right on the tablet ... you know with a little pencil I could guess I could have signed with my finger I said this is new they said yet makes it real easy um\nProbably because there was nobody behind me in line\nOr just have to just general conversation\nYou know hasn't been busy think the reins affecting that they said yeah the reins affecting it today because it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right off the there were three or four machines that were open and went in and voted and it was done now the interesting thing is I was wondering since I'm a college campus well let's see young people voting\n... because number one I never felt that was my real number two I never thought the people that were listening to what I had to say had to be encouraged about well\nThis is the great thing about especially our audience I I think the the the people that listen to our show and and and especially I think beyond or just new listeners the ones that have been with us for a while I Believe there you know we're all\nKind of standing in the in that same line you you were were part of that that same mentality and again they're they're leaving themselves I Know they don't need me to say it and they know they don't need me to say it and that's the great thing there is that um that that understanding and\nAnd the only thing I I I think I mean we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know war needed for is the fact that there are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their labs they got their families\nAnd our job any of them were in right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have we have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day and what's going on in the issues in a different form that they get from anything else and\nAnd I would say that's about it now and I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do\nWell that's you know makes me feel neutral [laughter] yeah exactly I mean that that's what we are I mean the the the uh think of it as a concierge service of information that right I mean it got to their people out there that and many of them on the other side of that are very well informed and just tune into here's the smarmy\nYeah some do [noise] all my friends do the weirdos [laughter] you know I mean you are\nAnd some way we do actually get some people saying yeah it was

hit yesterday was a bear of a day\nYeah yeah yeah down or over six hundred points\nSo ah the you know here's the other side of I guess and not a lot of media on on that obviously the media was on everything else that was going on uh with the suspicious packages and everything but\nYou or the administration and they're they're probably looking at this going okay as we go and get what are you know again twelve days out from the mid term they need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return\nUh some of that a positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of ah any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen but you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs\nSo the material costs especially with steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on\n... and but I remember also the the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on Canada timber coming until NAFTA is actually signed right or whatever it is the new now than they do now and we're not calling now [laughter] All right\nUh but as far as an end so housing has gone up you know we look at it was an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred today it's it's pretty big issue ... uh and the rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you and I are totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slow is a labor is material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment developer or in North Dallas\nFor video road log here is your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the

providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south will be drawing out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend\n\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bingo\nWe've been saying for years and this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked\nWhere do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement who do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want he\nSaid again I have argued elsewhere the party should have embraced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and former Democratic pollster just to understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand five ... just ... they they made the decisions a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years of Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWell with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that same Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\n\nYou make the accusation Democrats won open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you wouldn't want done\nIssue them the challenge and that sort of thought it was shown a saying here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't and they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you know get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we have brought to your attention the demographics that want the least legal immigration\nInto this country\nAre blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even Trump has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that the ...\nAnd then that politically but\nThe other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want\nAt all you know the president wants you know what the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say and you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics but they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll pull ... we're going to pull aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries\nSaying we're here to help you help your own people come\nUp\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes but we\nAlso we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunger and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nKnow go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want\nThe other side won't do after they're part of the party that endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it will silence is your consent\nYes Saul inches your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that now that's Doug was shown whose looks like to me is it the longtime Democrat\nWho are both to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the boats most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that wants the least legal immigration into this country\nLook you have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback\nIf they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nTell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party\nThat is actually saying that in promoting his Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two may be clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle ... how can we ever how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won officially tell us what they would ... what they want right\nExcept for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans for Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in them in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will ... is the question

Mary McNamara morning welcome [noise]\nAh [noise] latest\n[noise] here on the events from yesterday the FBI said [noise] ah last leaving that identified seven suspicious packages\nAddressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and the parents and for the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and the packages were addressed to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible that additional packages were mailed to other locations\nOr this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was a target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central male facility was evacuated after employees\nFound a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported\nWas addressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to waters that were similar to the five and a reference and its earlier statement\nThe LA police department tweeted that its bomb squad had rendered the package at the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we\nUh have a right now a again a the one thing that is\nA but I I think uh everybody\nWants to know is worthy ally bombs were the Israel bombs now we must admit that ah that the national review story that has overnight gone viral on social media\nRight now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw it from CNN you saw it from the the the Democrats are you know we're picking were well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't have any\nVery few very faint when you're ... we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities have told us already\n... the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise the you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself and there were plenty of them on television yesterday\nSaying well it looks like see what you got here and what you got here okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um you can tell the like the label on the packaging that went to see Annette well\nWe had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things\nBut in terms of\nThe the bomb experts that were on well here's what it looks like still doesn't tell us the facts what it appears to be and what it might be for what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me the most though is again the people the cry that the you know there are the\nUm\nAre the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness while at the same time there\nUm\nThey're the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness while at the same time they're ... their their behavior is the most divisive which is Trump is responsible for this and you have no idea who did this you have no idea the auto idea who did it and you're claiming you're against divisiveness\nYou're against it and you you have this kind of surety or tried to proclaim and you're being the most divisive in that moment\nAnd it's so obvious and they seem to be completely and totally clueless are unaware that it's like I'd die you're just saying you're against the divisiveness yet you are committing the ultimate sort of divisive this by blaming somebody and you don't have any of the facts\nYou don't know what the facts are and you've already come to a conclusion of who's to blame if that is the ultimate and being a divisive media outlet\nTell us where we're

one in that and build a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that uh the claim is he gets wine and works out during work hours which we found really interesting per cent of race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation at yeah they were just why not but he\nDrinks or you want to have purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours\nYou're probably a salaried workers were just going to take a salaried employee yet yeah uh but but I I'm thinking that that that's it but the do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after\nIt's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people with the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be ...\nI I Will set an adult I mean with if if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly out because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it\nIs something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad it was terrorists twice\nHere's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think they'd have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the tree branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry of the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nUm you know what to do an Arab leader on her yeah right now you know you you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah which you know I Will see if if that point works out or if any of this works here within two weeks\n[noise] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party\nThat she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning here that board is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in at ... pro tired of writing a again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extremist you know in there that she doesn't she it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to\nBrought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way\nAnd it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric is what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah I Do what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're there they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing\nIs that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr better Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have ... votes I\nAte it because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions\nGo outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so\nThat's the effect is is that come out one Harris or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whenever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point Kamala Harris or you know and it's tied with as you're crazy Democrats she'd as she just did as having us that [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote app and\nWhere does she go on this well she made the choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she can dome that behavioral Lenny we saw during the cop Kevin I'm ...\nAnd and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided

then that's what the ... coming back ... bad may be received by these people just say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that's the that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it
