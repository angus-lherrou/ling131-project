have free time talk from these last couple of days and I look forward to today and Marion heritage is actually your Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get use to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious domain your kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the market's low show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check it out on my Web page there are number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word for someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now and the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position and the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on on the first segment at least and see your response\nThe issues really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the college last night and you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss now\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here illegally and the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and another caller so that why you know what is going on it's pretty simple\nSo it was an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they want to drive home to go into your home but they just lack of proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account or right and they would be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but they just tend to have the documents to prove in the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left has won the argument over language\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers that ice who had the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they do these guys really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals here eating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated community so it's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools even for strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail used in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun he actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be staying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like a legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Alice island and they

six Ninety\nRead I were talking about illegal immigration and let's see what friend in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\n[noise] well they don't have\nA language that you talk about one of the biggest glaring thing to do it yourself are you a merry say American what actually we argue is\nAbout one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself\nAnd I used to do it but I'll marry you say American what actually we are us citizens in America and the liberals are not a liberal that's called radical there they actually taken at work in a plot to everyone on the side of this or so\nWhen they when they talk an American you know we think that it's just sitting here no\nThey're thinking the whole this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff and we say ... when we say Americans and they say American they brainwash us to think\nThat we're saying citizens and they ... brainwash us to think that everybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have one it's a U.S citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we stay or words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even want to air because the radicals or taken those words and\nThat's what I said\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refuse to do\nIt when I hear that word America or Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans ... you know North American so whenever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that\nOh and and you know some of the songs right American the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAgain and I don't want to concede the language limit at all that's what's important in legal immigrants in ... I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to him and and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit now we're Americans we pass for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're a national forecast for cobra electrons\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on ... eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone Easter the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies rain for Texas continues today\nYeah well we don't give me to the Soviet Union I mean you might say going now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say well you said like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an entire manager mess\nAll right but there are a lot of countries are we going to go first\nAction the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is it is a good one yeah which is we ought to charge the country's um for nearly used coming here I I I kind of like that idea\nEven though\nNo no it's a it's an interesting idea\nTo monitor their own people you know\nAnd as you and you're kind of indicating this and they they left has sent us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send them send us the poor and is not our problem right now is your problem\nAnd it's a ... and then you can also add on to that bill on the health care bill on your villains we basically it will stop the oil and stuff but you know let me but\nUh yeah there's nothing like the right incentive and that's the point with right now it's been the ruins and you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and listen to ... you know I I Would come here to that's why you sit\nThere and charge interest than we can make money so interest then we know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do oh him up\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know better than I Do oh darling Mm [laughter] I don't think that's a great call things the you appreciate it very much\nActually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education but as a person I said since then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president I Am a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what\nA ... it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that I think they were having someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out and yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president United States you could say well to New York trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse\nHis family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing\nI mentioned this last couple of days of the ... power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes because they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it over there as\nWell his tax returns are it's just not that their business I Know certain presidents have done I I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be private than it is one of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay a new my share but if anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff as they go after taxes\nLie to good people exactly why do people want to serve ... especially people in that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party now just to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things even limited government and government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do this and there was a man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the highest part of the United states they can name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get\nAnd I don't try to indoctrinate them I gave them both sides again why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you were going to have anarchy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is\nWhy I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think blamed mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they do this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of\nAnd the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to kind of car and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree vetoes it and then the house and Senate can override it and then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional\nThey really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut you most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six

New Jersey ...\nYeah how are you I'm well how are you doing I'm doing good I'm\nA white shirt pain on something I was at a restaurant I called up about a job you don't tend to believe what we would these people are saying these are Spanish\nMitt ticket and they said well you got older and the English in the language in our language to help us out what is your opinion on this\nI didn't know about jobs at this\nIn our language to help us out what is your opinion on this\nI didn't know about jobs I hate to say\nYeah it's outrageous and that's part of the entitlement mentality right you come here and you don't think you have to learn language which is nice countries and it went in ... one language like candidate divides people what do you expect when we give people things I write again in title\n... yes and one other thing I wanted to ask you know in the same thing on the same topic I worked in a pie one time there was illegal come into the country and he no green card no paperwork dislike you were saying earlier days working in a supermarket as a maintenance person\nBut yet\nIt's outrageous mark it's just outrageous what's going on what is the solution to this problem\nWill you may have heard me earlier of what I suggest is that\nUm you take away the benefits I Know the course of course to send their entitled to medical care and I guess the most of their title schooling which is why it's so important that President Trump appoint those lower court judges so judges aren't making law you know rulings like that and go on ... you know one person's making ruling that the rest of us wouldn't agree with\nWhat if you take away the benefits as much as you can and maybe more important 'cause I think most illegals coming in front of work or make sure you can't be hired if you're in a legal then most of them would go back to their native land if they can't work here and they can't get benefits and the rest of them uh Charles\nI'd be willing goes there imbedded in the community use that phrase my produce in our brain we are talking about here about that if they'd been here a long time they speak the language and they share our values right um yes and I and we build the wall but when we make that clear that we make the wall secure they promise to President Reagan they would do this so many years ago\nAnd the Democrats never agreed to it I mean they agreed to it never did it and so once you make the border secure and people who really genuinely care about this country and want to be part of it\nI I can live with that and I'm not a not for forcing them I mentioned the host name I Love when he said oh you like Obama set up ... and say you guys are going to deport them all no I'm not\nI never suggest that don't use that argument against me that our people like me that we never even make but if you take away the matter of fact you make sure you know that they have to work here if they're legal and then they would leave most people would leave and the ones who are just stay I'm happy to have\nOne more thing I was a county committee andme in a long time ago and back in two thousand seven and eight in my town I saw a lot of problems in my town but this topic is really a cheek a subject you know [noise]\nYeah what was somebody bought into winning subject when people like you so I answer to it at a year to to uh I did okay right\nGreat [noise]\nNo I'm just saying we saw the world's problems Charles all dance to do is listen to you and me and the listeners\nIt's not it's not legal legal yeah it's not that hard well why we have this bad legal illegal and legal you know on a legal way mark ... why is this so difficult and the answer is hard why is it hard\nBecause they have an agenda their agenda in many cases to get votes or to get cheap labor and so they they are just huge\nYeah that is morally want Barack Democrat paid you know was open note open border yeah some\nSome of them don't love this country I even though they say that or at least the way is right now he do\nMark right like we we uh love this country\nAbsolutely it's people are saying some some of these people who come in this country actually want to kill us some of these people want to work OK\nCharles just 'cause I I Want to get some more calls thank you so much\nAnyway we solved it let's go to a boost in Overland Park Kansas Bruce or on with mark\nAnd mark hey gotta fight over we're having a ... on this but I'm\nA uh like the topic on on this I from the point of view I Need to ensure that our educational system is teaching young\nKids and young adults what it means Being American it'd be proud to be an American I don't know that's being done so\nI kind of do it but most teachers do not you are right that that course an eye on it in their\n... that happened in it's\nIn my interactions with people in their twenties and thirties so it's limited to knock you you just don't you don't know if he says that pride in America\nHeadline that more and more\nOkay so like I was saying before okay so in my mind where our our whole immigrant okay because little ... and then I mean when the United states was founded on the fact of what is\nFacing pilgrims landed on the block with the Native Americans are already here so that land was taken from them from the beginning set in a while\nOnce you get once they took over land and decided to get in here and go back older scene and get African American leader who will then everything else and bring them back all the daycare cat\nOkay then once you leave that that I don't even agree with the fact that in turn down Confederate flag me pulling down federal legs or statues because that's how my children\nIs real good to have them up because in the U.S will know that the laws through on the south laws\nAnd in Texas some is they didn't even want to let alone three light with audit Cindy from the beginning we didn't find out until would not generally paint\nYet ... June ... June of ... sorry Tony from June ... so my point being is this you have on and be Ali's walls yeah I Want to have yeah won't complain about the sanctuary city my whole question\nHere um lock 'em why may not be in jail for a for for a million with these girls you know you've got ... and\nThat is for one and most of them out and he joined them away but they're not being locked up\nFor a certain crime and they feel like they're real nice for them to be able to be to do those things you have\nComments you're unless you know ... and I'm ... I'm ... I'm\nWell I appreciate you letting me finish on on the show that I'm doing but okay go ahead I'll let you finish but you may argue about attire\nAny and\nOkay I mean I'm a I'm a cut it out and then you know a lot of times when I look at the the\nSome of the incidents where people have been shot was not people I I kinda agree with the police I don't blame them because you should uh you know say you should have did you know at here to what they were saying ... to do but\nStill I mean I don't no matter how you get into Manhattan probably\nOut immigrants to a land that was ... hours in the first place [noise]\nNever have met her in the ferry boat no no no I'm going to rely had enough they might want to go in the History Month ... was\nNever around and respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay so I gave it a lot of time\nSo first of all you said something about the land was taken from me and said they were here first the only problem with that as they were Indians before those Indians and they're in these before those in the end and there's nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's you know he's the unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history so even Indians took it from other Indians\nAnd in terms of the slave trade you also probably know this may be don't many of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks were brought blacks over here I'm not saying was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will but you do you have to put this in perspective\nThe time it was you know slavery was absolutely awful and horrible but it has one country let's try to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world\nIt's the United states of America we understood that that came out you know they can even might no no no it's my turn now to monitor\nAnd we understood I just had a black person that they are I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on\nAnd the uh I don't I wasn't sure your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you say that the police when they do some shooting I couldn't do if you were trying to say that they\nAh they were not being responsible and some case sometimes that does happen someone gets shot and never should have been shot and they're they're they're good and bad policemen they're even talk show host but in general that you probably notice to most blacks are two murders by blacks or buy in from other blacks\nAnd in the inter many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep going horse of going and now you respond [noise]\n[noise] okay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything about\nHow so how president I appreciate everything he's done because I'll have a dog what Air America dirty laundry instead of everybody sweeter right for them a little bit under the ... like it's darn now that it out and dance forecast that\nWould be everybody would knew that when you have Republicans that's against me because I hate how and how he acts that whatever the case may be ... stupidity goes a long way it goes a long way\nBut I thank God so you see in a lot of people\nLike I tell a lot of my people y'all can get mad at this man I Want to but one good thing that he be great about in this country was air the fact that you know racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's car\nWe we we we weren't so where's he wears the race will see me with the most black unemployment rate maybe ever but we were exactly see racist I did I didn't catch that\nI'm not saying like I said he aired the dirty laundry this country has been racist meaning many years but\nEverybody wants to fly didn't know that are now mine now I have no that is because in a way to embrace asked what\nRadio station emails because yeah very on edge is a big black beat to respond on here\nNo one would expect anybody responded by the way I'm by the way you kept saying my people iPhone we're all Americans that we all live in ... John Kennedy slaves were on the end for you and the people on your side and by your side I don't mean color I mean values in politics people on your side I have a group mentality I\nDon't see people that way I see people as individuals\nAnd I want you know I like people share my values are way way way way back\nPeople on your site and have a group mentality I don't see people that way I see people as individuals and I want you know I like people who share my value way way way way back I Know it's not your turn now I'm finishing so let's not talk over each other\nI Would be happy you may have heard me say this this week I'd be happy with nine a black women Supreme Court justices if they share my point of view because I don't care about color and it looks like you do\n\nYou still there at the gym and if she didn't make me I certainly didn't I just wanted to know that maybe something happened here we dropped her but uh\nYou know it's just it's it's sad because of you who you are there some reasons here yeah there are some people still think else Presley is alive\nSo you can account for that you know there there's always going to be not cool heads out there but the overwhelming majority of Americans want what's best for everybody they live their lives they don't care about color didn't we make a mistake\nA long time ago we did we paid for that and try to make a difference and and then she said oh President Trump policing showing how bad things are no I think the country's doing fantastically that's what we did last night\nOh how great the country is under President Trump series says some things he shouldn't say but you notice they'll charge him with stuff like he's a racist but then they can't name anything to prove these races right\nAh [laughter] it's it's very discouraging when you get calls like that might people I Love that phrase my people what do you mean then on your people you're the one that's caring about color I I don't care about Colorado ... let me know something I noticed someone's black that lasts for about a hundred and no attempt to the second and then I get to know them who they are\nBecause color tells you absolutely nothing about someone tells you nothing\nI care about values and it doesn't tell me anything about ... tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye that he's six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine mark I slur on red eye radio [noise]\nEight six six months on ...
