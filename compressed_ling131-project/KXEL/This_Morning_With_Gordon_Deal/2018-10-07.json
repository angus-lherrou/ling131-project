andme and the timing of her views if you see\nA lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time that can be a sign that it does or fake reviews [laughter]\nUm that's either a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a budget new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if there is a product just launch and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time
