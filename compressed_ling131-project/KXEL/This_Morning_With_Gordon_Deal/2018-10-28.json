think about their financial I can try to figure out the right road for what\nAre you talked about the favoring positions for their lasting value but I like your approach just skip the car to the family to Paris or more likely to talk about that for years to come in the car for example\nYeah the problem with possessions as while they offer lasting\nValue that's also the trope back you know once you buy a car yeah you're thrilled initially but then you have to watch deteriorated over time\nAnd as you want you to erode over time the ... goes from being a source of happiness to social unhappiness by contrast you take the family to Paris you're going to go there you can have this great week and then you're going to come home and anything your memories that trip going to get better over time maybe\nYou're going to forget about all the incidental annoyances the long line of passport due to the time that you couldn't figure out the parrots metro and said what you remember the high

talked about uh using money to create special times with friends and families you said maybe a sporting event or are going to the theater dinner out with friends but in some circles I could see where that would be considered frivolous spending money you should put in your pocket\nYeah there are all kinds of spending that that other people think is for less than I think it was a while but it's really goes back to the previous point about experience it you know the research tells us that\nExperiences deliver more happiness possessions one of the reasons that experience is to live a more happiness is because they tend to be activities that we do with friends and family\nIf you go to a sporting event if you go to the theater if you go out to dinner with friends not only can you have a great experience but you wouldn't be doing it with friends and family and\nAnd I so often that you can talk about it with them you can share the story with other people you know so spending money on experiences this kind of a huge boost to happiness it's much better way to spend your dollars than by possession andme or over and I think it's just a\nReally fascinating statistic research has found that having a really robust network of friends or family not only delivers greater happiness but it also boost longevity in fact heading a robust network of friends and family gets to boost to
