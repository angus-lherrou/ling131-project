your budget than anticipated homeowners and auto insurance claims tend to jump during the holiday more on what to expect and how to prep for Kelly grant consumer reporter at CNBC dot com and you also a certified financial planner Kelly what should we know\nThing you want to be thinking about it what is your insurance coverage because for most people you were looking at homeowners vandalism crime that's going to be covered but even when you look at those numbers you know the numbers are up you know these are just claims that are big enough for people to be worth it filing a claim you could have a deductible of several hundred dollars\nThere is you know the numbers are up you know these are just claims that are big enough for people to be worth it filing a claim you could have a direct a bowl of several hundred dollars before it kicks in obviously when we're talking about the spike we're talking about big colored claims [laughter]\nUm so you might even have a couple of hundred dollars on the before your insurance kicks in um worth it to know what that coverage looks like and then on the auto front with the folks tell us at the insurance information Institute is about eight and ten people have\nA comprehensive coverage which is going to cover them vandalism stash of auto parts all that sort of extra damage that's not a collision so if you're one of those you know to in ten and don't have that coverage might be a good time to be making sure that you really are okay with that risk\nThis spike in claims that includes I guess what's on what's called Mr night doubles night or the night before Halloween\nYeah that was always a big thing when I where I grew up in South Jersey with the night before and travelers when they were pulling in this data they said that they did see a little bit of an up tick the day before but they suspect that you know for most people if there's damage that's occurring at eleven o'clock at night the night before you're probably finding out about it when you wake up on Halloween really may assume that ...\nThat spike on Halloween\nHas some wrapped into it from the night before\nHe was speaking with Kelly grant consumer reporter at CNBC dot com she's also a certified financial planner and she's written a piece titled Halloween is the scariest day of the year for this financial shock or talk about the jump in insurance claims around Halloween for things like\nPerhaps the damage to your home or your car or what kind of steps can we take to minimize potential damage\nA liability coverage is another thing you want to look at their because that's everything from you know a trick or treat her trips on your steps in in a sustained some injury to if you have a pet um you know maybe they are not as fond of all these college student visitors as as you might be [noise] um so you want to be thinking about your liability there as well I'm sure\nYou can do things like clear out your yard and sidewalk potential hazards make sure the path\nTo your doors well lit and then consider you know keeping your pets away from the door if you're at all worried about how they're going to react\nTo sue it's the best case I guess for checking for these potential gaps in insurance you might have not all of us refined print obviously\nI mean it's obviously really read the fine print if you've been working with an insurance agent or whatever company or using for your coverage just reach out to them and get a sense of what your coverage might be for some of these things especially for something like liability coverage or dog buy coverage but a lot of variation within their that you know it could be worth a quick phone call\nUm and then in terms of securing your home that's another kind of key component of this if you're going to go out and do some trick or treating or you're going to some other sort of festivity\nYou know that's where you want to be thinking about ways to you know just make sure that your house is a less
