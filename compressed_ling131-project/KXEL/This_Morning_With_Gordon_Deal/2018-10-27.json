interesting scare actors basically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read\n'cause see they are going to be more creative you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her will raped across it with a rake and then\nThey got punched
