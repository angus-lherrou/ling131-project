paid every two weeks but for some that creates financial hardship bucket watches Murray all the money is here with the information on some on demand payment companies that let you decide when you're paid Maria how does this work\nKind of a common problem you know we don't really get to the side typically how often we paid our company decides that [laughter] but the issue is with so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck um you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something else come up\nBefore your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so now or the smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this [laughter] um or even\nEven though you might have already earned it so now we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this [laughter] um or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your paycheck um but not as alone more as just you know\nThey might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\nWhat kinds of fees are we talking about\nSo one of the company is um it's called even their only client right now is Wal Mart but they say they're going to be expanding\nAge are just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interest that you can pay on a on a\nPayday loan it is relatively small um I Try to another company called daily pay and they said their fees are more similar to an ATM fee and a max out at three dollars so\nEvery time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know in an expensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than some of those interest rates ended up being\nVery as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that it's actually just a historical precedent um and it really there's no technological reasons for not I think going into this story I thought you know there must be some ... some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and from time to stop [laughter] um their contract with that company depends on how many times\nThey have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nTo it already is actually um you know ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um\nYou know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green not to do that and square um and so now that those\nType of gig accounting me workers are used to doing not that it's kind of shifted into the you know ... to ... regular payments cycles um you know\nEveryday workers are now saying we I Know someone that get paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me so that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nYou think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nThey offer like a
