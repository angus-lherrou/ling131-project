might take you longer and I think you while there to say that somebody else but you know if you can't get Fifteen Percent of your income\nYou know tomorrow that okay and you can start and you can and should up one percent one percent one percent a year ago to take but he thinking of it and those little sharp like oh let me get that match here [laughter] okay well next year on the other one percent
