do political beliefs figure into these identities Emily badger rights for up shot at the New York times looked at a brief survey Emily would look at\nYou know we were talking about this topic at the upshot because we came across some survey data from the early to thousands where people were asked okay here's a list of identities which one is most important to you and you know the options are your gender your race your religion and the political party that you ... with\nA part of the country that you grow up and and and you know we were sort of surprised by how Americans have answered this question in the past\nA religion ranks really really highly for a lot of people that want it to the most prominent things\nUh you know sort of people's family affiliations whether you identify as a mother or father or life wakes really highly and politics were like all the way down at the bottom of this list and\nWe sort of suspected that perhaps even see something different if we ask people this question again today because it feels like a moment when everyone is thinking about politics when politics there's like a pro bathing everything around us\nSo we we surveyed this question about two thousand people and found once again the politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of ask them this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nAnd it's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live and breathe politics the way Washington news teams who\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days

hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still\nTo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue\nDaycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday\nAnd they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals are to those nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve meals because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where\nA more than

according to a recent report from the data analysis sperm price ... marketwatch reporter Jake capacity has been looking at this report Jacob what are we learning\nThey basically looked at you know the price of a marijuana and different cities across the U.S and Canada\nAnd compared it and what they found is that a candidate says about thirty percent cheaper\nAnd Canada than it is and the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because Kennedy was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses\nA for many years now and so there's a wider range of dispensaries there's a wider range of producers in Canada than there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that [noise]\nUm that wider range of production ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply you know whereas here in the U.S uh you know except for the states where it's legal or illegal at the federal level and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAren't so at the medical marijuana been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know they have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so [laughter]\nYou know because they

where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having the whole you know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and for that make things harder and tries to cos\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal

civil relaxation you\nWatch the TV or go on that wonderful vacation but I think for a lot of people over this material goods didn't prove so satisfying as much of relaxation I'll put a leftist stealing board and restless instead\nI today when I talk to people they seem less interest in the good life\nAnd more interested in a good life what do they mean by a good life what I mean there's one that's focused on spending time with friends and family and doing work that is fulfilling\nAnd where we have this sense of financial security instead of running on a donut treadmill trying to get that next promotion pay raise in touch is focusing more on being content in the moment\nI Know that that's often easier said than done but do you do put together some concrete examples on how to get on
