I I can just imagine there are a lot of die hard\nWhen the world series after about a hundred years or so the area changes a lot is how I mean\nThere was historic oh it was the late ... I I I can just imagine there are a lot of die hard cubs fan she'll for the opportunity to live where you do and and so it's good to know you appreciate it what it is that like I appreciate what it is now [laughter] so talk about what it was about the experience they were you here for years I was there for you All right\nAnd I say that because sometimes it's fine so this was of\nEurope you're a product of the four year plan what is it about four years that helped position you for the career that you now have\nAbsolutely I think a lot of it was in the beginning coming up with the game plan to see what I wanted to do in my time at you and I\nOne of the big things I Want to do a study abroad and I was able to do that twice during my time hair one was in England for a semester in the second was in China for about two weeks\nThose kind of a nice opportunity to different global experience a and while that didn't directly affect my career path but it gives me the chance to communicate and relate with people from all around the world\nWell yeah it's not direct but the just the experience of being abroad and seeing different cultures and I just spoke to some of us would smartly says Chicago is a different culture but again it prepares you exactly on life and one every may come up\nExactly no it was definitely a great foundation and on top of that and then through the years being on different student organization um some specific to my major and real estate and then others\nUm it was a tour guide I mean I work at a student in mission ambassadors to give tours perspective soon so I mean at the end of the day they don't all correlate to what I Do every day but they all in some way helped me put me in the position I Am\nWell there's a level of confidence that one games from interacting with a wide variety of people you obviously have to have presentation skills if you're going to give tours you're on the alumni association born as a students around you are as also you're young all mom\nOf one kind of connections and I don't mean in a very crass way but I mean what kind of connections were you able to make by taking advantage of some of these opportunities you did wireless do\nAbsolutely I mean there was so many just doors that became open a connections with previous alumni but also everyone knows someone I mean you look back\nAt the job and now in with the company I Am it was a friend of a cousin of a friend that knew someone and that the catching it all came from you and I'm so it's really you never know if you're going to be and the panther family is very wide and you never know when you gonna run by on\nIt is impossible to ask this question because you went to school at the University of northern Iowa advantage or experience but I'll ask it anyway\nI compare the experience you had here for four years everything you just mentioned how does that relate to the experiences that people you have come across later have had because I mean obviously you compare your experiences\nMy sense is that the un I experience is unique even from the one I had at the University of Iowa was simply because yes the region's institutions yes there two hours apart by car but they are very different places talk about the distinct business of the un I experience\nAthlete comparing my experience to others that might have gone in the state of Iowa but now or in the state of Illinois that compared my experience and\nTo think of what I was able to put in four years here between studying abroad to major getting involved and probably six or plus I'm seeing organizations and then still having a social life and the opportunity that I was given here aren't you can't compare it with some of the other institution itself\nAnd and I I Want to identify that because I I work a lot on field so there's The Simpsons and when you say you just can't compare it I get that but for somebody who has some have that experience\nIs a matter of ah having in essence whatever opportunities you wanted veil of all is it a matter of personal growth what what are some of the things that again you just don't think you could have gotten if you had gone to even somewhere else and all that well I think a lot of\nIt comes down to our faculty and staff and the amount of care they put into their students to see them succeed I'm looking back at major classes when I had twelve to Fifteen people in the classroom the professors are going to make sure that you are out there and doing the best that you can and put that personal\nAspect to it I think that's what definitely pushes you and they want to see who grow in exceeds so that faculty and staff and being taught by your professors here I mean excels in the long run\nNow before we started this conversation I simply said well what were some of the things you were involved in it and you mentioned\nOne thing and if you're listening and you have a small child listening you know this was a spoiler alerts here's just a warning you may want to was just during the falling down a little bit but ah you have a close relationship with a very well known figure on campus\nI Do sell over the four years I'd get the privilege of being the the um I started as a freshman and through the four years was on\nThe person behind the mask at a time so it was a great experience being able to connect with not only Nineteen anywhere from infants who elderly and everyone in between whether it's educational and sporting events um recruitment I'm In pretty much anywhere in between but\nIt's what's unique about you and I as\nWhen you are to see it as a secret and no one does know who is behind the Mac guy in\nIn in just violate some code of you know I Am now graduate or I can now speak freely of it so the\nDay that um you cross the stage at graduation you get to where the feet I'm across the stage in that is kind of your\nGuy out very soon and so you\nBasically tell the student body that you were to see and what was funny is my I had told my immediate family just because\nWhy am I skipping all the events why am I coming back hot and sweaty there are a lot of questions so rather than\nTrying to come up with excuses for that I told them but other than that I didn't tell anyone so it's kind of shocked when you're walking across the stage and at the time president rude was there and he had no idea either so walk across the stage I have my shoes or the feed on and just seeing the shock and some people and\nMy sister in law we I did not tell her and so when we cross the said she turned to my mom and\nHe never told me she's like well now we want to if\nYou don't they don't actually we didn't actually he was sitting\nHere too so it's kind of a it was a fun event to share\nWhen you are in that cost and there's a sense to me that if you were to do it it might be kind of fun and it might be liberating and you might be able to have this whole different persona funniest seems to be a lot of work because you really got to be on especially if it's during an athletic\nAbsolutely so we go through extensive character development on to make sure that the the thing you see today is the same D.C are going to see in five years and so we make sure that um the experiences great for everyone and yet you get to become a whole different person and it's kind of shocking to see I mean who you become and\nIt's there's so many opportunities that you have when you're behind the\nBehind the head that you just don't get to do when you're a human\nOne of the things that has struck me and we've only got about a minute or so left but the use of tea CNC K by the alumni association which is in charge\nOne of the things that has struck me and we've only got about a minute or so left but the use of teasing TK by the alumni association which is in charge as I understand our universe English is all in charge of this [noise] this is not just showing up and cheering and again this is a broad broad connection with the community at all levels\nAbsolutely I mean the the travels and ... I'm pretty much any event you can think of that the universe is going to have a president they will be there I mean it's sporting events it's a small percentage of what\nUm where they had had I mean any recruitment events um they've gone to Hawaii they go to all I mean anywhere that you and I are going they're probably going to be there as well\nDid you ever had and and when we did this program from the Iowa hall pride in Des Moines prior to it panther caravan so I was able to see the interactions of the mascot with the youngest and not so young and it it's a fascinating thing to see\nDid you ever have a situation where afterwards well probably not because people didn't know it was used to say wow that was really I mean to to where you didn't even realize how you were quite acting\nQuestion is you know he keeps his place looking so great and uh it really is a an attribute to our\nGrounds keepers and our facilities people because people are just blown away when they come back to the capital [laughter]\nNow how do you do it it's like being on the part\nThat it really is the other questions that we get of course this is how the university going and and the worst in Rome and headed and we've been working on our ... of course it's been down a little bit but we're coming back up those are the the big questions you know just what university doing it you're going to win the football game and and those sorts of things that\nUm the other questions we hit or just how you guys enjoying being at you and I and show and I just love it it's going very very well\nAs I drove up to the campus today and I and I was able to have a a singular moment of literally parking on the grass for about ten minutes yeah no that's not acceptable and we moved to the end but it but I thought to myself well this is something you don't get to do every day on radio station vehicle you get to a market where you want for about five years\nBut you live right here on the campus down again the experience that that I had at Iowa\nWell it's on campus but it's the north in scans you could avoid the president's house yeah the president's houses right in the hardest thing\nYeah we enjoy it you know I'm a doll houses literally less than that it's probably fifty yards from here I Am sitting right now in in ...\nAnd uh it's really close to the the office the great thing is that you know show and I could take our evening walks across the campus go down past to cap the meal out to the dome it around and back or over through the the south campus up\nPast hillside and things of that sort [noise]\nIt really is like living in a park I mean there are a lot of city parks around the country that are half has beautiful or a third as large\nAs our campuses and so it really is a a special special blessing for us to be able to live on the campus in a home that's a historic and his well maintained a as the president's house at the University of northern Iowa\nAnd when there's event an event on campus whether it's music or athletics or drama\nWe walk there ... Lodi so short lock and oftentimes you know we make multiple events and an evening of that and and then you know the commute back home it's pretty sweet just walk across the street in some cases and you and you're bound to find somebody you know on the way they do that's right well you know we've been offered rides and many times have\nYou know it's like they got two more blocks to kill I think we'll be okay that's what I'm\nFinally best thing for you about the experience journey that you've been on as president of the of this university for what two and a half\nA we've been here now at this institution twenty months just a little over a year and a half by far the fact leading the students um uh you know all the employees here faculty and staff really committed to this is because of our students that just committed to students that their success and that's a big plus for us\nWilling to go out of their way to help students meet their goals set their goals [noise]\nUm but then the students you know they're really hard working there Iowa kids for the most part Midwest kids are really committed to working hard they know the value that this education ask for their future lives not just their professions but their lives\nSo they work at a pretty hard and then they've got this Iowa spirit Midwestern spirit of of helping whoever needs help so you know you'll see students helping other students make it and and and really get successful as well so\nThat sets a community that you feel here is much like you know what I felt growing up in a small farming community in northwest Iowa\nI'm you know if you need something someone's going to help you out [noise] um if you see somebody need your help them out and uh it it really makes a special place there were big doings in hosting this week I said\nSomeone's going to help you out um if you see somebody needs to help them out and uh it it really makes a special place there were big doings in hosting this week or so they in fact the governors there I think right now in Iraq and cutting the ribbons for the opening of\nOf highway twenty I guess my home town and and uh they're not too far from where my parents right now\nPresident no thanks so much for taking the time it for the wonderful bronchitis and I appreciate the relationship and your time again today well thank you for all your support and it's a wonderful relationship thanks very much a mark ... is president of\nThe University of northern Iowa we will have more from laying home but first check inside the ... in thirty seconds on news talk Fifteen forty ...
