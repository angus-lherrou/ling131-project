course you have last week this pipe bomber\nThen we're reminded the fact that it wasn't only people on the right obviously Republican congressman getting shot by a Sanders supporter of the year before that certainly uh\nUh is is certainly front of mind as we started talking about these things the heinous act in Pennsylvania on Saturday if the synagogues is there's so much of it and I don't mean to be flip it at all but there's there's so much of it that it really\nWere almost numb to it to where it does not have a political or electoral effect\nI think you know there are certain themes that emerged\nFrom any good news story in at like the one you meant that you know the Trump presidency and administration they were quick to condemn these attacks President Trump saying you know there's no place in society for this kind of violent it's kind of that I think that and the reaction of the last was it with a effort\nTo claim that President going there standards as we saw in that statement from CNN which was just\nWrong to do I know basis and truth\nBut you know that's the last ... continually overreach with any of these stories that really expose their their tactics there struck them or is this tactic and their their willingness to blame something as atrocious that those that divide that we saw the president of the United states which again had no basis and truth I I think certain themes emerged\nFrom any of the given news event that we see and those teams tend to be\nSo as we're looking toward these midterms the RMC is investing heavily for obvious reasons last week I think it was announced twenty five million dollars of being invested by the RMC in a variety of ways wonder some things that\nFolks in the mid west this may not be aware of that the national party is actually doing to help candidates\nOn the stage or on the congressional level\nYes so one of the biggest things that the Republican National committee died at our data operations and I one of the ... that we advertise we don't\nAren't the because we found that it far more effective advertising and the fact is I bet that somebody candidate that far more active from art gambling with our record that have the data operation at the quarter of a billion dollars and what\nThat allows you using consumer data were able to target\nA thousand or so short or phone line that will determine the election and maybe it's an independent voter and we need to first way that they need to become a Republican voter or crafted their Republican low propensity voters that we need turnout going door knowing those phone line knowing what it said give ease\nThe civic households that will determine the election these persuadable voter\nA key and worried that if I were able to pull out victory narrow victories states like Michigan and Pennsylvania that ... that was because of that investment at the data operations\nNow I'm going to play devil's advocate for just a moment because I talked to someone earlier today was the same feeling I Do you just don't even bother to answer the phone this time of year unless your caller i._d. indicates you know exactly who it is is they're released some measurable effect these days to having the big phone banks and calling\nOr Canada actually have a bit of a backlash because again we're just inundated with things who do you target so that it is effective maybe that's a better way to phrase it\nYeah so it's it's a very small universe of voters who we know are going to be open to our message I indicated you know maybe they voted in the past\nI'll give you an example I I was on vacation last week on and my great state of Florida\nAnd they called for about an hour and you're right a lot of folks hang up on us they just they don't want to hear from someone who they don't know personally but you know I did manage to eke with with the young man who was the first time Trump voter and two thousand sixteen had never voted Republican previously but we're going to turn out go Republican this time and that extra call a\nYou know I think what it over the top ... and his mind he edited it for that type of Trump voter I'll be a Republican voter so you know everything going if you have a filmmaker on that and each ... is one way to vote or like that\nI did I Do think it makes it different diet but I get what you're saying the fact that I'm not wanting to be called by a political party or a telemarketer but we've had it but not for it nevertheless\nAnd again people who are listening who say why are there are so many ads well I could get into the long district\nPretty or a telemarketer but we've had it but not for it nevertheless\nAnd again people who are listening who say why are there are so many as well I could get into the long dissertation about the FCC rules in equal time provisions and low was due to the rule and all of that but suffice to say we have to air the ads\nAnd it doesn't necessarily make us any happier than anybody else but we have to hear the Arabs and we can only charge a limited amount compared to a furniture store car dealership but it does add to the overall aura\nAnd of course they're all these outside groups it's not just a Senate campaign committee a candidate committee now you've got all the interest groups and so there's there are even more ... than ever harder to get through all the quarter\nThat's right I mean people are inundated with calls but nevertheless it's important because voter contact make a difference and you know as we weren't making the call is if we weren't putting in that time and knocking on doors down a lot of people saying where's the Republican Party these days I haven't heard for not that\nGreat new there that people have heard from the Republican Party and we've had literally millions and millions of voter contact\nAll across the nation and it's important I important to hit the ground running not take any votes for granted and he'll run forward I think a lot of these races I may come down to a few thousand if not ... and that's why it's so important I knock on every door and color rip on line\nOf course here in the state of Iowa the current governor is a Republican Republicans have the majority in both the house and Senate\nWe obviously know the situation in Washington the state GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann told me not long ago his biggest concern was complacency namely the voters who leaned to the Republican side would just be all everything is okay and not have the motivation to go for us so that it would\nContinue obviously the president being on the road multiple days a week\nIs again a sign of not to be complacent and those who turned out as you mentioned as Trump voters in six to you have to be GOP voters to keep it going in ...\nAnd the exactly right and about a third of folks who voted Trump rallies that\nAre are Trump voters they're not mid term voters and that's why we have to make that change that connection in the minds of voters that you know you are an ally of the president you squirt the president\nOr we've got to give him allies and walking and I mean sending Republican Congress to defend it means keeping your state red they'll come you know twenty twenty time we have a better filled with with Republican legislature then Republican governor who can help make the extra mile I some of the key swing states like Iowa I Would include in that\nSo it it's really important in every vote counts that you know I I just really encourage everyone getting cats are valid already an early voting at that you don't want to like the day it's very important\nAnd there's a lot at stake in this election I didn't get a day the way\nWe've got a couple of minutes left with scaling back many of the ... and see we've talked you an eye on this program about the fact that my assertion is that the prior president did not have mid term coat tails people that may have voted for him when he was on the ballot or didn't translate\nGive us the sense of why in a midterm general election we already know what happened was special elections but with regard to the mid term general election what is there to suggest that this president will have enough coatesville effect or halo effect or whatever you want to call it to\nRun against history in essence with regard to the Congress and seats either lost or arguably picked up\nWell you talked about the special election record where the president has a pretty strong record there like white with a door that the primary when he ... the candidate they have you know thirty forty point swing die\nAt ... ... ... or ... candidate but what we have also seen and that most directly answered your question is the Trump rally\nAt factor meaning I Will have a nominee maybe down by a few points in Tennessee where Marsha Blackburn with ... and then all the president goes into rallies read and now our our slacker and a poll after that rally would that by double digits at\nThat point and we've seen the famous ... and ...\nOn Montana ... men and positively ... they're really all across the nation I coached rally we said hello and behind the nominee and so I think that those coat tails that you mentioned the president clearly has them where President Obama did not\nSo if we don't talk before next Tuesday I'm not sure what the schedule is but what are the best productions at this moment obviously you're optimistic about retaining control for the party in both chambers in Washington but from the realistic number standpoint\nThis is one of these is the election were held today questions what do you think the numbers would be\nWell I think with the Senate out we would be looking at them and so again I mean I'm Talking going into the you know fifty sixty territory I think New Jersey we ended up winning not that bad a group they thought he was a great candidate within your point John James ... days are\nGaining ground that within six points they've competitor and those are the ones that are uh you know kind of kind of reaches that we could grow into the category not mentioning the ana where a nominee is the head I North Dakota and Missouri I\nThink we can get to its effect if not\nHire and you can't graduate pretty optimistic lack of our lives and about that at the house it's fifty fifty I could go either way I don't think public polling tells us the whole story and\nI I flip the coin at this point when it comes to keeping our house majority or going to put in a strong fight that we know history to get that\nWell flipping a coin is a little more optimistic than it had been not long ago so we'll see how it pans out in a week and a day Hailey thanks so much for the insight as always we'll talk again soon\nLet me come back to that and just a second but I I Do know people that come from quite a ways away from other parts of eastern Iowa to attend this event what has made it so special and given at such longevity that's been able to to reach out and and connect with people over a large distance\nReally well I think I think the main thing is the artist um a lot of people come back every year for\nA ... and artists that they bought stuff from over the years through generations they pass these items down and they like to collect it and\nWe have just a a terrific lineup of artists every year uh throughout the Midwest from all over and we have several of those returning artist again this year I'm as well as many many new ones to come back out which is very exciting\nI'm [noise] I think the caliber of art at some of the mid west artists working and I'm just a variety of medium and in order for painting drying photography bled a ceramic jewelry and there's just a little bit of something for everyone at every price point\nYou're not talking about specifically framed paintings on Wall there are certainly going to be some of those but that's not exclusively what it is at art might intimidate some heat all\nIf if we just call this an art festival even though that's the formal title or when you think back on what you've seen there yourself in past years what sort of things stand out that are different from that\nPicture that will go on somebody's wall in a frame\nYeah well like I said there is a little bit of something for everyone we've got um I mean the fine art but there's also a lot of really interesting kind of unique craft um\nThere's a a great selection of jewelry that I think all these things out and as as pretty impressive um there's some really great uh you know handmade woodworking yet people that are done by a local artists that are pretty great um\n[noise] I Know I personally have purchased some some ... over the years um but I think it's I think it's really special because it's something that you can guess at the hand crafted and handmade and unique\nAnd whether you're buying for yourself or personal collection or whether you're buying for for someone on your list someone who's maybe hard to shop for um I think that you're you're certainly going to find something there that'll help about\nForty nine years to that's that's a long standing tradition for a you know something that uh people are really come to make part of their annual winter time November season\nAbsolutely and and we're really looking forward to this year's event I'm like I said I've got several new artist I'm\nIn addition will have the laughing tree cafe that's open certainly breakfast food coffee and tea for for patron 'em or something he says ... will be open both days normal hours that you can bring the whole family make a day of it the lunch play these civilian gets in shopping done um yeah to be a great point\nAnd it's a free event to so there's there's no cost to attend you're not out anything if you don't find that perfect gift that you're looking for and you know we hear all the time about supporting local businesses and this is a way to do that ...\nLocal support those artists and Everytime you make a purchase you can get entered into a drying as well we're doing that again and Ross dealers has generously donated another a beautiful Pandora bracelet which is kind of the grand prize along with another gift certificates to downtown businesses in restaurants so you get rewarded for purchasing as well\nLaura thanks so much again it's the forty ninth annual holiday arts festival after Waterloo
