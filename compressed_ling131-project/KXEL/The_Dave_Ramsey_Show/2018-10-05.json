again\nMore than once invited her to join us on this program we have yet to get a response we will continue to try to bring her to you but the congressman is here today\nSo the opening act of the debate starts tonight I like to think the main event has not until hours on the sixteenth but of course you're starting tonight uh the the opening act as in Cedar falls what in all seriousness you hope voters will get\nFrom watching this on CSPAN tonight\nWell multiple things most people that I talked to death and the district have never met her\nOr they don't know where she stands on the issues because basically she doesn't campaign [noise]\nUh so uh I think they're trying to hide or try to hide or in the basement or something I'm not sure so it will be good to find a era jazz and say about the about the issues\nAnd a and B a you know I'm going to a course emphasize my experience both in Washington DC my connection there now but also my experience of life more importantly you know being a father and grandfather\nAnd step dad adoptive dead in a business person curb business person for Thirty years you know versus a as she's her since she graduated from college all she has done as politics\nUs all she is a barrels she has been on and been government payrolls and so I just you know I think I think it will become obvious as that goes on to the contrast there between the two candidates\nWhat do you think you bring to the race other than four years of experience in Washington already that is\nYou bring to the race other than four years of experience in Washington already\nThat easy ... that was going ...\nThat is going to be helpful with a Republican president and potentially one or two Republican chambers in Congress after this midterm election\nI think a great example of that Jeff ... Cedar Rapids flood wall uh Cedar Rapids tried to get federal funding I'm Seventy eight million dollars they wanted\nUh for the flood wall for ten years and uh it didn't happen and then when a a President Trump became president uh as you said then we have a Republican and the White House and a meal and ... director that manages all the money that comes through uh the White House ah make more money as a friend of mine from Congress\nSo it's good to know the director of oil and be it's good to have a good relationship with the president United States\nUm I've got a great relationship with my parents as well and that doesn't hurt as bars when you need things I mean 'cause we don't have ... earmarks anymore which I agree with we shouldn't\nBut ... when you you know and some ... Cedar Rapids needs a flood wall and Marshalltown needs help after their\nUm tornadoes or uh you know this ... Cedar Rapids and did you want to make sure we keep our historic tax credits let's put it this way doesn't hurt to have those types of people you know and the White House ah being the same party and to have a good relation ship with them but the\nIdea of what I Would I bring other than that is I'm not a career politician I don't want to be a career politician I spent thirty five years and the private sector meeting a payroll\nOr every week and and creating jobs one of our companies had over three hundred employees and ah that that type ... life experience I think it's good to bring to the swamp as I call Washington DC and then and then lastly it's like ah I've actually done or tried to do what I said I was going to do and Iran\nAnd I've found since being in the swamp Jeff that that's kinda where\nMost people say one thing and the district and they go to Washington DC and do another uh what I say and the district ... exactly why go to Washington DC what I Try to do include\nIncluding drain the swamp including uh trying to reform like Congress itself and pass a term limits and ah pass I'm getting rid of the pension plan for congressman and things like that so I actually you have done what I said I Would do I think that's a that's rather a rare uh over here a trait in politics these days sadly\nCongressman Ron ... Dubuque Republican joining us live on these talks Fifteen forty K. actually how long this Friday afternoon so as you look at what there is to do presuming your\nParty maintains the majority in the house where do you think it's going to be on the short list for what would be or I guess third term if you're reelected\nYeah I can tell you what I Hope and then ... soon that your question ... ah three three things come to come to mind uh keep ... well for things keep the economy rolling\nUh we've read ... the economy up people's pay is up uh let ... second quarter of this year uh that was April May June people's pay increases we're the largest they'd been in ten years we have now more job openings Jeff they may have people looking for work\nUnemployment rates are record lows ah incomes are up take home pay is up because of our tax cuts package uh that's all good way to keep that going uh if we lose the house or if we lose the Senate ah best stuff will come to screeching halt because they've already polls they want to raise taxes and increase regulations\nAlso I think we need to look at infrastructure uh on the ... the president talked about infrastructure when you first ran two years ago overlooking the infrastructure ... uh so that uh you know we can repair some ... the infrastructure around the country and those are good paying jobs\nAnd their jobs that can't be exported ... other countries are so that'd be great to leverage spending there are combined it with state and local spending for these projects also we need to look at health care\nOr not we didn't because we couldn't pass anything and the Senate ah two years ago uh it's kind of just ... bit we've picked away ... chipped away ... parts of bomb uh care and other bills but we we need to look at healthcare and there's lots of things we can do I think on a bipartisan basis\nAnd I wish we would do a lot of smaller bills the one big comprehensive\nHealth care reform bill because that just that ends up being more government red tape it ends up being more government regulations and that's the problem we need to so when you look at healthcare and then lastly uh we need comprehensive immigration reform left tackle easy issues\nUh you know and in Iowa for example can't find workers most employers are getting fined worker so I think you know we need\nWhen you look at the immigration system make sure people that are here are legal and uh you know and also welfare reform\nAh I guess I guess that's five so I Apologize but uh you know if if you're physically and mentally ... able to work in your in your of working age you ought to be working\nOr or going to school to get any ah to get a skill for trade ah so those things I Hope we tackled to me those five things are five major things ... can tackle all those in the next two years uh\nUh we'd we'd be really a ceiling\nYou probably don't have time to watch these but I'm sure your staff is keeping you up to date on ads and things that your opponent or the PACs supporting your opponents say and the general thrust of it is Ron blown can't drain the swamp ... is that swamp ears they come what's your response to that\n[laughter] yeah they've got uh they're all spending ... tend to one uh uh my uh my opponent I think raises eight percent of her campaign money uh in the district ... eight percent\nOr I raise a over sixty five percent of my money and the district are Aggies top three fundraising cities are Hollywood\nNew York city and Boston\nDeaf and my top three fundraising cities are Waterloo Cedar Rapids interview and as I say uh I didn't know those people on the east and west coast cared so much about what happens in the first district of Iowa or but there's you know millions of dollars funding attack ads\nAnd ah you know obviously there are all negative they're they're just ... they're outright lies\nAnd uh when they when they say that I'm the swamp I mean my initial reaction was I laughed\nI'm the I'm the guy that wants to have a vote on term limits I'm the guy they introduce bills to get rid of the congressional pension program I'm the guy that said that there should be a sexual harassment slush fund let's end that make the people pay us back that benefited from it\nUm the guys that ... are paying Congress every year we don't balance the budget every single year cut our pay\n'em the guys that we should eliminate the first class air travel paid for by the taxpayers for congressional members which I don't do and we should eliminate thousand dollar ... paid for by tax payers which I don't too I'm the guy that we should limit the pension programs so when they say I'm the swamp uh laughable definitely laughable\nWe always ask ... listeners just send questions by email this is not so much a question ... comment that Mike wants me to a pass along\nAnd I'm just going to read it directly can you like representative ... no I'm concerned about who supported northeast Iowa around the rice they'll wind springs and Chris go areas I Do not see many blondes signs but I see ... plastered ... everywhere and it's from Mike\nThe rice they'll wind springs and crushed go areas I Do not see many blooms science but I see ... plastered every everywhere that is from Mike so er an unpaid campaign advisor perhaps a fourth\n[laughter] well I'm effort yeah I'll talk about the er at you and I and I and that is that what is it seven o'clock\nI see yeah yeah something Seventy\nCorrect seven eight and you can see it on the C SPAN if you are so inclined I've got only about forty five seconds so if you had to sum up this is the elevator speech why Ron Bloom again for Congress what's the answer\nThough because I ran for Congress for all the right reasons and that is Iran for love of country not to be a career politician uh and uh uh uh I vote against my own party or what I think it's necessary an independent uh I voted against a sitting Republican speaker jumping on my very first vote in Congress\nIndebted that not sit well with the establishment GOP so I'll I'll nobody's going to tell me out of all I vote or I think about each individual bill and I vote based on what I think isn't the best interest of the the great folks back here in the first district and I'm not a coup politician don't want to be a crew politician effect on drain the swamp\nOn it and they find ways to score
