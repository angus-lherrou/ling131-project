weather service not much in the state at this very moment there is a small band of precipitation in the Manchester area probably not hitting the ground a little stronger band or precipitation\nAnd now we deal with sex trafficking issues and now there are so so ... basically our focus is working on public education and awareness\nWe work with corporate America to try to get them to do the right thing and develop really good tools and become corporate Lee responsible and we also worked with government to law enforcement and public policy to get our laws\nUpdated and then the ones that we have on the books and forced\nOne interested you in the topics that you would make this your life's work\n[noise] [noise] oh golly that that's a loaded question so the short answer is um I had had says sexual exploitation an abuse of my life and and when I started here at enough is enough it all started the gel together I had one at a lot of the\nThe difficulties and challenges that I had gone through\n'em to count for something bigger than me and this was way before me too and uh and so I've decided the past twenty five years to preventing are trying to prevent\nA especially children from a sexual exploitation and all the different forms that takes today\nDonna Rice used joining us she used the president and CEO of enough is enough enough dot org one of the Web sites where you can find more information so I mentioned as we begin the conversation when you think of trade agreements I have to tell you I did not think of human trafficking\nHelp us understand how this new agreement really was something of great importance to you and your organization\nWell absolutely um I I there's a little back story here\nI'm just this past year ear your listeners might recall\nThere was a big piece of legislation that was signed into law bipartisan it was called the fight online sex trafficking act and it was [laughter] it was it was quite a battle\nTo get this this law into place and um and and basically what that what this law now does is um [noise] it allows state prosecutors and knocked also victims of sex trafficking\nUm that have been sold 'em through advertising on sites like back\nPage dot com and Craigslist than others\nUm ... for those victims to be able to to to to get justice and it also allows for state prosecutors to go after these sites and that may sound like well why didn't they have that opportunity before and the reason was\nThere was an old law that was in place that we were actually involved in back in Ninety five [noise] that\nUm the the purpose of of this provision was that if\nThe industry the technology industry\nMade a good faith effort to protect children from pornography then they would have immunity from prosecution well fast forward through the here it was completely misinterpreted by the federal court and the businesses like back page dot com or using that\nThat good Samaritan defense\nTo get away with having advertising on their Web sites where they were selling children and women for ... and for ... sex traffickers so it really became a tool of aunts and traffickers et cetera\nSo it has taken us almost Twenty years to get this done\nNow interestingly our biggest um opponents to this ah we're we're not Congress I mean it was by part is that it was at the high tech lobby businesses like Microsoft\n... to this ah we're we're not Congress I mean what it was by part is that it was at the high tech lobby businesses like Microsoft and Google and Facebook\nThey were fighting against is and funding the war against all of us and the trafficking groups we had about a hundred um organizations involved in pushing this through um Congress\nAnd because they did not want this to in any way and called them any problems down the road so when they lost with with the bill passing a we call it foster for short\nTheir associations and their lobbying then went and said a hot\nWe've got an opportunity to neutralize this law in these trade agreements so they they still totally slipped in\nUm the old language that we just got amended\nInto the trade agreement ... so of course our coalition groups got wind of this and we had to go back to Congress and to the White House and say hello\nUm we've got a problem here um industry has done this and big tech and their lobbied through um the Electronic Frontier foundation and some other groups that are really front groups for industries interest\nAnd um and so it was quite a big effort and we did get the White House's attention in and got a members of Congress attention and they they were able to change the language so that in fact\nIs very important law well actually it's a still be in fact I'm In these uh and and the trade agreement with Canada and with Mexico so these companies will not be able to get away with this um over our our borders\nAnd again the agreement has to be approved by the legislative bodies and all three countries with no easy feat but obviously if you didn't have this included it wouldn't have any chance of being involved so it's a victory of this level\nYet we have talked on this program about the topic of trafficking with folks\nLike friends with the family and the cedar valley and others sued officials used as a topic that I think people do not fully appreciate the severity of\nWar how rampant it really is give us some sense of the hurdles you have to overcome for example going back to Congress for certain language you're having to educate people all the time on an issue that I suppose they don't want to accept as being real and be the the just simply don't understand\n[noise] well yes um I think Congress has actually been pretty proactive on sex trafficking I think one of the biggest challenges that we have is that\nHelping the public as well as our leaders understand the connection\nBetween pornography child pornography um sexual probation and traffic came because they're all interlinked\nThere there's this cycle of abuse and one\nFuels the other and so I'm said that that is really big issue the other I Would say is that oftentimes you know ... the public has a tendency to think that sex trafficking is not happening in their communities and in their neighborhoods and end their child schools\nAnd that's simply not true it is and so\nYou know No Child is immune from a sexual predator grooming them online No Child is immune from cyber bullying No Child is immune\nFrom coming across very hard core pornography does not protect the speech and getting addicted to it boys and girls ten eleven twelve Thirteen Years old and they're not immune from own traffickers\nSo um and then these are issues that\nWe try to get parents just to realize that they are still the first line of defense and that if you're gonna let your child be connected to the Internet whether it's through their smartphone or their laptop or it gaming device then you need to be prepared to be a\nA all on board cyber parent\nAnd and protect your kids on those devices by use the ... using that technology tools that are available and they're different depending on whether it's the gaming device or a smart phones but then also using commonsense\nMeasures and so we developed a curriculum with the department of justice called Internet safety one on one and all that information is an Internet safety one on one dot org there's\nA lot of free videos there there's a lot a teachable materials to use what your kids um and and you know you know I I just hear all the time and it's so common\nParents just say not my kids not my kids not my kids and I get phone calls all the time going if I it happened it happened to my child one of my husband's business partners\nUm you know nice needed to talk to me right away and we were just together with his son a few months ago\nAnd all of a sudden you know they find out that they're Thirteen year old boys and girls in the school had him take up a picture of his private part and send it to them and now it's all over the school and they're just like how could this happen to our son\nWell it happens a lot\nAnd so we're here to help parents understand first of all we want to prevent these things\nAnd we want to you know prevent our kids from being sexually exploited even if it's by other children\nUm but you know and and of course by a sexual predator trafficker which is you know far worse because\nThat that I mean that can just devastate their life has so many ways so [noise] the Internet's great um but it's it's you know the bad guys are using it to like the good guys so if you're not prepared to parent them online and use all ... all that is available to you to use to protect that\nDevice than my advice is to protect the device that is the my advice is don't let them have that particular to tool mark phone if you're not going to keep it safe then it's better just not to let 'em have it in the first place\nAnd again it's a broader movement if you're not prepared to parent you should have children anyway but again\nIf you're not prepared for parents don't tip because it is a twenty four seven think that the kids are using this technology twenty four seven I mean they are on all the time they're connected or then they're having conversations often times you know with her friends in person\nRight yep looks like things ought to be okay and then the next chance of rain after that will be somewhere in the friday night Saturday timeframe and that's really a pretty low confidence right now because not only do we have this system coming across they also have hurricane Michael is going to be hitting Florida hard\nSo there's a lot of moving parts of the next three days and if we have to raise the uh rain chances for Saturday now will will consider doing that later on this week but right now keep it a pretty low chance than kind of keep that thing's pretty conservative right now for that ring chance this weekend\nVery good ... symbol talk to you in the morning we'll check in with the first alert whether center next hours well okay sounds great Jeff how the rest of that you do the same thanks so much Kyle merit TV nine first alert meteorologist
