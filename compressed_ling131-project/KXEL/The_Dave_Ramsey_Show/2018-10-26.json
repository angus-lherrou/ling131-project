things over night but there seems to be real very good attitude I had the mayor give me a windshield tore I had a walking tour where the within a few days after the tornado so you could see\nRemember the destruction and it looks a lot better now\nUh they're still decisions we made should this building come down or tend to be repaired\nThere's a lot of residences of uh where they've got to make up their mind are they going to rebuild or repair\nUh or or are they going to take a buyout uh the mayor says he's got to make those decisions but it's tremendous progress I was a little disappointed\nWhen the mayor told me that it took them about\nSeven or eight days before they had somebody from FEMA sit down with the leadership of the community\nBecause we were told that they ruined divert people from assessing flood damage or to Marshall's town but evidently they didn't keep their word so he he he admonished me to that is very helpful if you get at least the leaders of\nFEMA ah to come in and sit down and talk to you so I had an opportunity to her there and then I had a cue and they was about uh eighty or Ninety people at the rotary tub\nI went through there about a month ago and again it is striking when you know what the community looked like when you know what Lennox industries looked like when you know that this street used to be rather shady was tall trees and now it's just bare\nWhat can the federal government do that it either is not doing or it hasn't yet had time to do to help you or whether it's in marshal\nWhat can the federal government do that it either is not doing or it hasn't yet had time to do to help people whether it's in Marshall town or other places similarly situated\nMostly money but the personnel\nHas to be there to make decisions and to work with local people\nAnd of course you interact a little bit between the federal government and in the insurance companies of the of the various businesses and homes that are involved as well\nBut it's pretty simple uh I\nI don't want to ah dilute the harm that's done but when the federal government comes in to help itch is pretty simple from the standpoint that we've had basic laws on the books for\nA federal government helping a natural disasters for a long period of time they don't seem to be much different if it was a tornado hurricane flood a earthquake et cetera et cetera\nThese laws are in place and uh do you meet a does a city or the county meet the qualifications law that does then there's certain programs that are just naturally are are going to be triggered in and then there's the case of financing so at the beginning of the year and a budget you have X number of dollars in the FEMA budget\nA winter runs out of like it did ah in in regard to Houston or in the march a corporation Vail we uh put in Ninety billion dollars for\nA more recent uh a decision made by a Congress there was a just a few billion for a certain natural disaster but it's without controversy that we replace those funds when they run out\nAnd want to ask about ... and we knew that you were going to be in here for about a week and so of course I think about things I'd like to talk to you about and this topic came up in my mind but\nIt's made even stronger given the last couple of days with these supposedly bombs filling up places and so the broader question\nAnd I don't want you to telegraph anything that that would be inappropriate do you have greater concern now for your personal safety or safety of family members given how\nHyper charge this environment is and have you taken steps to either enhanced security or change what you do\nThe answer is I should have more concern\nIt doesn't enter my mind wrong long long enough or often enough\nI'm both for me and my family ah\nI think it's not it's not wise or not they always have that on my mind uh I feel very safe\nBut you feel very safe on Capitol Hill and because there's just a hundreds and hundreds of police when the federal government hires just for Capitol Hill besides the metropolitan police\nAre we find ways of avoiding a lot of controversy like how do we ah ah go about our office mailing from her office building over the capital but you can avoid everything\nAh and then over the weekend you know we found out that somebody had threatened me back way back on Labor Day uh go kill me and they are also or going to kill senator Collins\nAnd uh so I'm ... and they arrested this guy or just the last friday on Long Island now personally I Long Island is he a threat to me well he said he was going to shoot me you know\nSo uh he's arrested now and in the court documents I'm senator number one but evidently somebody leak that senator number one is a Chuck Grassley and senator number do is they're Collins\nAh but ah this ah this was an anonymous call them I sue city office and my Cedar Rapids office around Labor Day\nSo you don't get much concern about on on anonymity because how can you hear are following down so I'd like to know how the police run down his guy and we got him arrested but he was arrested friday I'm told\nAny sort of make light of it because it comes with the territory to some degree when you're a public figure there will be people who take issue but it it seems that\nIt has just gotten worse and worse I mean literally to the point that represent ... another shot a year ago on a softball field them then then these these purported bombs yeah it's the sort of thing that that it even so accessible and your career\nIt it really be a shame it rank Lee if that could not continue that makes it not worth it well\nI intend to have it continue if there are threats you can get a a short term police protection\nA I don't like that but you can get it and I've had very little in my lifetime in thirty eight years in the Senate so uh yeah I've had a great deal of freedom and will continue to have a great deal of freedom\nI think the bottom line of it is oh it's a reflection of a lot of civility in American society\nAnd those of us in public office oughta set a standard for the rest of the world and even those that are in public office like former attorney general Eric Holder was quoted on TV is saying that uh that uh when they're down will kick them\nYou know uh and uh and things like that and the president's been accused of saying some things that\nAre that are a might ah ah encourage the sort of thing we should be setting a standard for the rest of the world but uh I mean the rest of the country but we also got to realize that there's a lot of less civility in our in our society as a whole and then you wonder well a\nWar how come Congress isn't more several well it does to some extent doesn't Congress represent the the grassroots of America were representative government\nUh but that doesn't mean that ah I should just accepted and be on several uh I got to set a higher standard\nI Hope I'm not making light of it it's a serious saying and yes you are to or you want to or a particular he was senator Collins or\nPeople that she was taking calls during the cabinet and the threats that that ... and the main things that were said to ... brand new staff people\nYou know most of the news to ask people in my office started out being in the front office there in front line they're getting all the calls mast yes and what they have to put up with and the threats that they get too so it is something that that\nYou you can't make light of\nLet me ask you finally stuffed hailing from that and maybe funds not the right word but is it still is much fun as when you\nFirst went to the point in Nineteen fifty nine or to Washington in Nineteen Seventy four or in the Senate in Nineteen eighty one\nI don't know whether I respond to the word fun but I'll tell you I really enjoy my work now more than ever before\nEven with the instability in society even with everything else there\nBut I'm sure you are really enjoying my work no more than ever before\nWe even with the instability in society even with everything else there's still there's still that same thing that drives Chuck Grassley to go to work every day your public service senator thanks for the time as always I appreciate it thank you\nUS Senator Charles Grassley speaking with me yesterday in our studios in Waterloo\n[noise]\n[noise]
