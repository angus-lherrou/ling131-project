by pets trusted my own country vet natural dot com welcome\nBack to the business news hour free food that you have for today we are sitting with the president of\nOur young age are her name is Melissa ness she's been with the company about eleven years and we're going to talk about male culture and what it is that our young does and what has happened and what is perhaps the future Melissa welcome to the business news are so nice to have you on cue\nI'm very grateful to be here\nThis is a wonderful opportunity for you you have studied under Ron and Joel at Oregon for some time and send it to the presidency of Oregon but before we get into all of that let's refresh individuals as to what it is our nature does\nAbsolutely so Ari on HR is a ... and if he really stands for professional employment organization\nOur goal is to provide integrated cost effective HR services for small to medium sized businesses as well we have a really large niche and a senior living industry\nSo both and both of those areas are mission is to continue to provide innovative and cost effective and service obsessed services any HR area for them\nService obsessed have interest in with him\nAnd means our goal is to serve our clients to be innovative for them to care for them and to give them what they need and we really services our number one principle here it's it's so important if we don't serve our clients well you know which includes ... certainly an internal uh then we don't succeed\nListen is ladies and gentlemen and for the interview All right let's talk a little bit about about age or services in general um a lot of moving parts in human resources um\nAnd and we see many individuals that are all kinds of organizations Sherman others that are trained age are professionals at a constant basis\nSo Oregon has this age are component that comes in to assist nonprofits as well as for profit small to medium sized companies so that those businesses can do what\nSo they can focus on what they're passionate about or they can focus on what they went into business for their dream of\nWhatever their entrepreneur heart desires so you know they most companies will really none go into business to do HR work to figure out that compliance to figure out all the way they need to attract and retain and maintain a great culture while staying in compliance but we did go into that business\nSo we would really like to help them and add to their business so that they can focus on whatever their dream as and their business\nWell there's a stat out there that suggests any way that those companies that are outsourced they're HR tend to grow faster than those that don't have the\n... because they have time to time back on their hands the focus on how they grow their business\nAnd they're not bogged down by a day to day and play relation issues are not bogged down by creating a strategy around attracting and retaining their talent or not bogged down by compliance and all the different government regulations that are looking at and and monitoring compliance in HR\nYou know it and you get to do what you love to do yeah ... and you guys do what you love yeah and it's what we love to win [laughter]\nI think one of the things that a mid Flynn has shared with us in the past ... that I Believe it's important for people to understand I just said\nFor profit entities as well as non profits and nonprofits had our mission driven that's their goal is to be able to fulfill whatever their mission is not necessarily to do the work of a chart that'd be\nA ... way that we have over a hundred and twenty nonprofits that we serve here and and yeah they all are wonderful community and mission driven folks who have a heart of helping others and we want to encourage them and give them time back so that they can do that and put as much time into that as they can\nSo you've been with Ari on before that I was married yeah resources for how long the eleven years\nThose or eleven years now started as what I mean yeah I personally I started in the role of controller so really what that meant here was overseeing accounting and tax and compliance and some systems and kind of a\nA bag of different things at my background is in accounting and so that's where I had my career before here and then when I came to marry sources began I I have always really enjoyed the client aspect and the people aspect and the leadership aspects so\nOn as time went on over the eleven years just explored more of that and I really really enjoy that aspect\nWhat are the things that many companies don't have in place is something called succession planning and the president of the entire corporation Ron and a former president of the church ... must have been somewhat influential in assisting you\nTo rise to this position would that be accurate\nAbsolutely at great mentorship great empowerment great leaders that they both are and and then particularly I worked more closely longer which all who are really just\nI've had a I I had a conversation a very long ago was a relatively large insurance ... type business and their CEO told me you know Michael if they can follow the mirror were hiring them what's wrong with that strategy\nWell it's expensive because you know on ... and it depends on the business\nIt depends on what those people are doing I of course and the strategy behind it ... it you know in most levels it's expensive because if you get the wrong people that's really expensive it's expensive on\nDisappear training and turnover it's expensive on the people around them who are affected by that turnover and again it's expensive on the clients who suffered depending on if their client facing or not\nOther than ah the difficulty in attracting and retaining employees one of those threats are out there what other challenges are there to employers everywhere\nI mean the big one is compliance with just you know keeping up with all of the regulations knowing you know you don't know what you don't know\n[noise] then I think that that's the truth it's the truth and and you know these these entrepreneur fake it right right and and the worst part is is they they try to do everything they can and that\nThey know about and and what happens is they get tripped up and something happens that they didn't know and and then they have signs penalties that different really not great things and that really pose and out of their dream I really ... and out of what they're trying to do\nWhat about the future for ... ... what do you think ... as far as your your you send it to this role is president of the organization\nYou have a great staff I get to visit with many of these people on a regular basis and it's not just age are but you've got other functions here under the banner when we talk about ... recruitment side here all these other things [noise]\nUm what about you but where where do you where do you go\nWell I mean from here for me it's all about growth for the company it's all about you know continued growth for myself I mean I'm a big believer that the company gets stuck with a leader get stock and so for me personally it's\nHis you know equipping myself with everything I can to help everyone here succeed and that includes employees and that includes our clients and so\nUm that's always my main goal in mission is to just do everything I can and give give give everything that I can to make that happen\nSo there is an amazing team here I mean\nNothing happens without them I'm just I just fortunate to be near them so to speak it's on so you know giving them what they need empowering non growing non resort getting them resources whatever that that's the future for me and that's the future here there's a there's a lot of demand for what we do\nAnd that we have to continue to do it better and more innovative\nAlways Joan Collins challenges yeah\nShe makes people's hearts sing ladies and gentlemen what a great comments thank you so much
