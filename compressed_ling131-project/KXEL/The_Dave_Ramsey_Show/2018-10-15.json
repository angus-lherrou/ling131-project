not include cedar valley but it does include took ... hand areas around\nThat area so it's land and Johnson Iowa cedar cannon\nThen you can go back and read the other half of the book which is taxed that goes with the pictures\nI didn't want to say it was a picture book because I didn't want people to get the wrong idea because there is an awful lot of really good information but again it's uniquely positioned so that you can see it\nIn a visual way especially younger people we hear a visual learners and you've also got all of the textual information to go along with it\nGive us a sense of your background that puts you in the best position to found muscular portfolios dot com and to come out with a book by that name\nI'm a dot com entrepreneur I sold my window secrets dot com and two thousand ten and I needed a way to explain to the people who are going to have all my money how they should manage it\nWhat I found is that the old lazy portfolios that were popular in the Nineteen seventies and the Nineteen eighties are completely wrong they crash\nThirty forty fifty percent just like the S P five hundred and people are very afraid of their life savings being cut in half like that they cut their losses at the bottom of the bear market and then they are buying and selling low we have to stop\nThat pattern and that's what muscular portfolios does for you for free as give you\nA cushion against your your portfolio ever going down in a market crash\nSo as you saw that you had to explain to others in essence chuckle when you said that you had to explain to professionals how to manage your money\nIt was real surprised you don't mean this is not your first rodeo you have reported on this stuff as a journalist for years to but did that even surprise you that some of these concepts were being missed or the people who were supposed to be handling these things for folks were thinking so narrowly\nWell I\nHave seen many many Wall Street enterprises that sell people risky investments and they've pushed this concept that you must take more risk in order to make more games what I've found and we have found from people who've won the Nobel Prize in economics and the twenty first century\nIs that the thinking of the old twentieth century is wrong you make more money in your portfolio by reducing your losses by reducing your risk that's what people need to know we have a bear market coming up this bull market has been more than nine years long that's one of the longest in history\nAnd the bear market is going to come upon people very fast it will happen without warning it will happen when people least expect it\nAnd in two thousand eight the market went down more than fifty percent\nWe need to show people how to gradually move their portfolio into assets\nThat in the index investing revolution ... can cost you one penny to change from one index fund who I Know that that's never been true before and now investors have this incredibly low cost way to protect themselves from crashes\nThere are a lot of folks I presume who are listening and we know from our research that they can see all listening audience is somewhat affluent highly educated folks\nBut I think there are probably still plenty of folks listening who might say well now wait a minute there are professionals and this is complicated I don't want to take on the responsibility I'm afraid of making a mistake\nThat's old thinking isn't it because the tools it's not like the old days where you went down to you know the the AG Edwards\nYou know making a mistake that's old thinking isn't it because the tools it's not like the old days where you went down to you know the the H. G. Edwards office and watch the ticker right I mean we were in a very different world with consumer accessible means for handling it even better than those so called professionals\nYes the professionals aren't doing anything for you that you can't do it for yourself the wealth managers are charging two three four percent\nOf your life savings every year for doing nothing more than you can find now on websites for free\nTravel agents one out of business when the Internet it made it possible for you to get a plane ticket or a hotel room all by yourself and wealth managers are going to be going out of business because websites like muscular portfolios dot com now show those signals absolutely for free\nExplain what you mean by signals because that is one of the things as I understand it that separates what you're talking about here from some other things in the past year telegraphing what the signals are that used to be if you will a rather in sealer code among the ... just a very few people\nWell first of all you need diversification and your portfolio you should always have at least three\nDifferent kinds of assets in your portfolio is where the vast equities whether that's real estate whether that's commodities or bonds but more importantly than that the winters are the Nobel Prize and the twenty first century have shown that things that went up in price\nOver the last three to twelve tribes have a historical likelihood of going up in price for the next thirty days\nThat's all we need to know you can keep your ... and things that are going up and keep your ... out of things that are going down using this very simple easy formula which is never going to be sold by any hedge fund any wealth manager because there's just too simple for them to convince people that they need to pay a fee for their help\nAnd again I don't want to dismiss want a professional manager can do for someone who either has no interest or claims they have no time I mean there's a role for everything but there are people who have been scared off\nA and and what you're talking about with muscular portfolios dot com and the book by the same name that was released last week\nIt's taking some of the mystery or the fear out of it is that right and and when and where am I misplaced because I get a sense that a lot of people say they would do it but they were afraid of making a mistake and so they don't try they don't venture forth no pun intended\nIs is that the assessment and and what you're finding which leads this to be the right product at the right time\nIf you have an IRA or four one K. or any savings program and you feel like you need someone's hand holding to reassure you that you're doing the right thing the book muscular portfolios shows how you can find a low\nThe only wealth advisor and not a person who is charging you two three four percent of your life savings per year by paying an hourly fee a person can look at your portfolio say this makes sense this is the modern way to do it this will protect you got crashes but you won't be paying them a percentage of your wealth every year\nAnd that is where a lot of people just don't understand how much they're paying until they really sit down and look at it\nAnd realized that that is money that it's fine if they want to pay it but it could work for them much more efficiently through just a modicum of time and effort on their part probably less time to manage your own money than it takes joined you interpret these quarterly statements from a folks are paying a fee to\nWell if you're paying a three percent fee to a wealth manager and many of them charge much more over thirty or working career you will lose half of the gain that you would otherwise have if you had not paid that fee and you had just watch your\nPortfolio once a month it just takes Fifteen minutes to check the muscular portfolios dot com website do what it says turn off the computer and go out and have thought\nMuscular portfolios dot com is the website the book muscular portfolios the author is Brian Livingston and he's joining us live on news talked Fifteen forty can actually yeah\nWe've got just about two two and a half minutes left so if someone is\nListening to this and they hear you give the website is you have and they think okay this is just another guy trying to sell me something you're talking about free information the book is obviously for sale so people have a compendium of these resources but the website and all of this is for free correct\nYes I have put out twelve bucks and muscular portfolio since my twelfth one I'm a journalist so I don't want people's money I don't want to manage people's money I Want to educate them how to manage their money themselves\nSo if someone\nAgain timid and maybe I'm just telegraphing my own fear about getting into things I don't know enough about if someone is timid\nGive me a suggestion of something that if they go and see the news letters on the website or get the book what is something that literally within an hour they're going to say it was worth their time and energy you mentioned a couple of things but you give me another example is we close\nPeople who are starting out or people who are a little timid we have for model portfolios and the book there are four questions and you just answer yes or no and that leads you to the portfolio that's right for you one of them is so simple that you just hold to index funds and\nYou only need to check them once a year that's the simplest possible portfolio that works and that was actually designed by Jack Bogle the founder of the vanguard group who is a pioneer and index funds if you can take a little bit more effort and check your portfolio once a month you will get better games with lower losses it's up to you\nNow when we look and taking care of our money\nThis is not a set it and forget it kind of thing this has to evolve and change based upon who we are uh how old we get ... and it depends on other market forces so this is something that does require a little bit of gardening a little little care and feeding but it does not have to dominate your every waking moment\nNo people don't want to make stock trading their second job they already have a job they have a family they have a life\nSo you can't\nTrust a lazy portfolio because that says you should hold the same index funds and the same proportion for your whole life that's why these expert that either journalist and reporting on have developed muscular for polio and you do need to check them once a month you can't let your portfolio draft\nWhat are they seeing what did they learn that's different than when they see agriculture in the U. S.\nAbsolutely so yeah we just returned we actually had a high school I got it caters and they brought a student along a within their act programs in FFA members we paired with um agriculture high schools in Kosovo um they got to see how agriculture was different how the classroom setting was different\nUm and some of the comments came back as our lives will never be the same and I think part of that is um you know they they're seeing things different but it really gets them questioning how we're doing things at home than\nCould we be improving our agriculture programs could we be improving agriculture production from things that we saw and just think about things differently\nTuesday as part of world food prize week one of the winners of that award from just a couple of years ago will be on campus at Hawkeye community college tell us about Dr Jan low\nAbsolutely yeah so we have Dr Jana vote coming to campus um she's two thousand sixteen world food prize laureate and she's a really about bringing nutrition and agriculture together um she's done a lot of work\nOn what's orange flesh sweet potato and the vitamin a a richness of that and really eliminating that hidden hunger I'm within Africa specifically but truly things that can be used around the world\nHidden hunger when you say that what what are you referring\nTo with the head and hunger we're looking at that you know if somebody's not eating it's evident by somebody may be eating but they may not be eating the right nutritional value food\nOr maybe it's a staple crop of rice which is great but it's not going to provide all of that nutritional value that you truly need to function and operate\nThe lecture will be on Tuesday at noon on campus at Hawkeye community college in ... hall besides obviously agriculture students were those maybe who are working in agriculture\nWho else do you think would find it worthwhile to attend a lecture by Dr low and and get her perspective on on what she's learned from her experiences\nThere's something probably for everybody army's just how you look at it when you know you look at practice says she's probably going to talk about that if she implemented agriculture it's something that maybe we can relate to hear\nBut when you look at the nutrition side you get health individuals involved in what is that doing anybody who's may be involved with their local church and outreach and\n... the hunger whether it be in Africa or whether it be right here at Iowa because we jumped to think about that international issues but we have issues right here in the state of Iowa with hunger as well\nAs part of world food prize week there will be a number of other lectures different places throughout the state other events or give us a summary of what you find interesting about the week that uh is ahead and ah what what you think some of the highlights are\nAbsolutely well there's all kinds of great things are going to be happening in um the Iowa hunger summit which truly focuses on hunger issues right here in the state of Iowa\nI'm swept great discussions on that Tuesday we have the opportunity to bring a doctor low to campus so those that can't be down in Des Moines they can experience that right here in the cedar valley without leaving and then the boardwalk dialogue kicks off on Wednesday through friday\nI'm part of that Thursday night there'll be crowding the two thousand eight teen laureates 'em and you can actually watch that on Iowa public television that'll be a broadcast and then also will be high school students down um for the global used Institute from all over the country um and also ten other countries that will\nUh meat in Iowa and don't mind too I'm Talking about eradicating hunger and feeding\nThe estimated nine point five billion people by twenty fifty\nBrand thanks for joining us to talk with us just a little bit about the world food prize week thank you it's great to be an brand Kinzinger is the director of hot guys global agriculture learning center we're talking with him ahead of world food prize weak in Tuesday's lecture by twenty sixteen world food prize laureate\nDr Jan low this is not the voice of eastern Iowa and new talk Fifteen forty chaotic Seattle [noise]\n\nSports\nFans get the sports guy ... if you love sports than you love to talk about sports and joined me more on ... weekday afternoon from foreign 'til six news talk Fifteen forty K.
