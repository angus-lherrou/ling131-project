three hundred and thirty miles across the state so that's what we'll be doing\nI'm hope to accomplish here in the next few weeks months\nAnd placing signage from Dubuque to Sioux City on that original alignment so people can just follow that in their cars with a historic route twenty science coming back into all the downtown areas and sort of a voice in the fall and we know why the ... they we appreciate the four lane but\nThis is for the small towns economic development tourism to get people into the small towns\nAnd Jay is someone who who travels and visit so many of Iowa's communities big and small or what would you like to see happen with the usage of this designation once it's applied\nWell basically doing what we've done our travel blog ... for so long is just increasing travel or in any way shape or form we can see in the state a historic route Tony has got so many towns on it and\nYou know that's the great thing about traveling through Iowa as it is a rural state that it it does have a lot of agriculture and things like that but I've been to other states where you go hours\nWithout seeing another town and if that's not happening\nAnd I it's just not there we might have a lot of rural areas but there's tons of rural community\nAnd that's what I Would like to see to any kind of brings into a together these metro areas because you know a ... a route Tony was was designed to go through a a a lot of talent and things like that same as like Lincoln and Jefferson\nAnd you know you know what I Would like to see is oh you know a lot more promotions and just kind of bringing us together so I Would like to\nNot only showcase the events in the places they have in ...\nYou know a lot more promotions and just kind of bringing us together so I Would like to\nNot only showcase the events in the places they have in these towns that are established by hopefully start up some new ones have our own kind of make it a a a whole a route twenty community sort of effort when it comes to some of these promotions you know there's so many people\nOut there that are doing this um eat local push a people on the weekend or they go or they want to go out and they want to shop locally I Want to they want to support Iowans when one of the best way to do that is to get on this route\nAnd find some of the best uh you know restaurants some really cool boutique some great downtown or in areas in ... in\nA town squares and things like that and Main street uh places in you know whatever triggers a road trip\nOr you know and whether it's a big event like a county fair or something like that or just you know someone with the rumor of having like the best like blueberry pie in the state\nIt's a funny this is the funniest things what get people out traveling and all of that is an historic route twenty and that's basically what I'm going to be focusing on too I mean you you go here to Cedar Falls they have some of the best public art\nOr you'll find in the uh in the state and they had in Waterloo Cedar Falls area has some of the best museums you'll find in the state and that's a typical theme you see an historic route twenty we have\nUm some of the coolest little town murals you're going to find we have a amazing county\nAre museums peppered through this entire route and that's one of the the the precious things about giving people\nA road tripping as they learn about these towns whether it's uh uh the uh metro area like the Waterloo Cedar Falls area or a small town like a correction villains are uh you know at an early places like that in\n... you get paid you get the history of Iowa while you do it and you are supporting local folks even if you're just stopping to get a candy bar at a local convenience store\nJay Jay Gould than is executive director of Iowa's portion of historic us route twenty we're also hearing from Brian far the president of historic us around twenty on a nationwide\nBasis has there been any feedback from folks in places like Rockwell City or ... city in western Iowa about their experiences over just the last couple of years since the four lane portion of highway twenty open\nThe old route went right through downtown Rockwell City insects city yeah and now that traffic isn't there potentially for their businesses it it certainly would have seemed like a very good thing to\nMove some of the truck traffic out of town I've got no doubt or people that are just trying to pass through and get by as quickly as possible but uh do they miss some of the other people who were taking over yeah hindering pace\nWell yeah I mean I remember you know my my mom's family grew up in northwest Iowa insect county\nThey eh we still have stories about like how we used to drive through Fort Dodge and things like that\nThe four lanes not going anywhere but neither is historic\nPart of route twenty that's not leaving you know it's still there and people are looking for great road trips so it's a ... it's not as something that that is really gonna change on its own we got to be able to do it and we can help some of these towns and these businesses\nAre getting more uh you know revenue coming in but they have some very talented folks all on this route\nTalking about what they're going to do as far as tourism\nCommunity building economic developing things like that and we're working with tons of them all over the route and one of the things that\nI kept hearing across the state was when they moved it to the four lane road it became county road be thirty six or something like that no reference was over to the old highway except many of the town still have that old highway twenty identity and so that's what we're trying to do is\nBring that back into these communities that had been bypassed to say yeah we're still on old highway twenty and that's what our goal is what\nIs the plan for signage whether that's a across the country or or just in Iowa and have other states started to implement some of those those signage plan so that people can follow the route more easily\nRight so across Iowa it's was first getting every city on board and we're just about there\nAnd it just depends on localities so for example ... county their tourism director basically went to the company said we want the science they pay for every single sign insect county Rockwell county the same way uh\nOut and would very county it's going to be a little bit different and so we have to go to different resources but it's all local locally done it's not any money from the state whatsoever so it's donations it's\nPeople communities giving back I'm actually did a fundraiser they said well put up half the money for the science and then the rest of the community came up with the rest of the money\nSo that's the way it's working across the state and it kinda gives\nEvery town feel like we are part of this now not something that we are companies that you have to do this yeah I Need to do this you know you want to be a part of this organization and like I said everybody has signed on and hopefully you know like I said within a few\nMonths will be having all of Iowa side yeah and those that scientists continues across the border so we're working in Nebraska but also in Massachusetts New York Pennsylvania Ohio we've had the same effort\nAnd in Massachusetts we have a bill pending to designate through as a historic highway so again all across the country we are trying to have some sort of connection um for each place to connect across the country\nWill finally these nationwide routes or like highway twenty like the Lincoln Highway or the Jefferson highway or many of them were established\nOrganically back about a century or a little longer ago they they got their designation as highway twenty in this case are highway thirty and Lincoln highways case or in the Nineteen twenties what else should people know\nAbout the historic nature of of how these routes came to be and continue to exist what what would you want people to know about the history of\nThis road that goes through Waterloo Cedar Falls to Dubuque in one direction in Sioux City in the other end and far far beyond\nWhat I say is your phone westward expansion more or less you start and I always say you start in Boston as a Native American path that\nYou know the pilgrims first song sixteen thirty when they settled and they just kept moving further and further west so then when you get to\nPlaces like Iowa if the railroad that was the railroad path to connect between Sioux City of Dubuque and Sioux City so yours is seen this expansion of the country and how it kept growing further and further westward and\nAll those very interesting again stories of maybe what happened on the road way\nIt's one of those things too there's landmarks all over this that this route I'm from from Boston and new to Newport, Oregon and I always know has no shortage of them and we're going to be in ... city on the thirteenth at ...\nThat is that this route I'm from from Boston and new to Newport, Oregon and I always know has no shortage of them\nAnd we're going to be in ... city on the thirteenth ... county cattle company where we're going to be a unveiling our new slogan and I think the new slogan is gonna is gonna bring people's uh interests up there's so many cool landmarks of world records\nAnd you can find on on on route twenty and things like that and uh you know we're having a special dinner ants insects idiots that county\nA cattle company where we're going to be showing a our vision and how we feel about the future of this route and everything and one thing we have hopefully coming up is we applied for Iowa tourism grand yes they do at a passport\nAcross historic I which won in Iowa so that every community can be a part of that and we'll tell you where to stop who to visit and every single city and across Iowa and sort of maybe get people who aren't even aware that this road now
