together we is that our Iowa's competitive dashboard and that is data that looks at how does the state of Iowa compete\nIn several different areas whether it's economic growth education and workforce governance health and wellness and so we say how does Iowa than compete with other states because we want to obviously increase our competition and you just hit on one of the key factors in Iowa\nWe don't have as many people who are getting education past high school in fact we rank poorly within that area so that's our education that team and and so how do we then take a look at that factor and figure out strategies so that people\nWill get some type of credentialing education past high school and moving to the jobs that we have\nI think he made another good point is that they're not all four year degree jobs and as business leaders we've had a lot of conversation about how do we do a better job\nOf informing parents and students at an early age about all the different job opportunities that are out there and what are those career paths in order to get into the jobs the education that they need\nAnd so when things that are members did is we pledge thirty thousand internships extra and ships and apprenticeships between now and the year twenty twenty five\nSo that students have an opportunity to get on site at the businesses and really kind of learned the jobs that are out there\nAnd get that hands on experience to know how the classes that they're taking in school applies and get them interested in jobs that maybe they didn't know about before and it also is an opportunity for teachers to come on site to businesses as well to then also learn about the different job opportunities because\nManufacturing job of ten years ago is not the same as manufacturing job of today and then how does that teacher then go back and talk to students about those different opportunities so it is important that we do a better job of really helping inform them at an early age that we can't do the job position\nI grew up near Marshall tone worked in Marshall tone it is a site where there is a lot of manufacturing but the manufacturing to your point that might have been there when I was growing up is vastly different because of technology because of mechanization\nEven down to it and we always used the example of welding but that is very different even then so it has to be a real sea change to get parents as well as young people young people probably easier they don't have the history but to get parents to understand that given the cost of higher education not everyone is suited for that\nAnd just a great example in power\nSo Vermeer they put together a manufacturing day and this manufacturing day is for students to come\nAnd experience all the different jobs that are there within Vermeer corporations and it's interesting because then they tie it back to what relates to students so they'll say this job pays you this much per hour which goes toward\nPurchasing and I found so just really trying to make that connection but then they also show that there is stem within almost every\nPosition that they have there you get an opportunity to do hands on welding\nUm and then different ends on experiences throughout the day so they have over ... ...\nThey have there you get 'em an opportunity to do hands on welding\nUm and then different hands on experience is throughout the day so they have over seven hundred students who have come to that I'm In their sixth grade and tenth graders who come and participate in that and so that's just one example of how they're trying to provide these opportunities\nSo that people know about those jobs but the other thing that I did was they came together as a community see a ... and Vermeer corporation and then the high school\nWithin their public career academy and they said okay what is\nWhat are those jobs are really in high demand and how do we start moving students into those in welding was one of them so they have a pre apprenticeship program now that they've developed\nFor students for welding and that is now something that can be used and shared throughout the state this new pre apprenticeship program it's a template that other industries can come together and take a look at\nIn order to do that you really have to I assume as someone who is ministry into a business you have to take a step back and put aside the day to day and all the pressures of day today and really look ten and Twenty years down the road\nThat's not easy to do for small business owners but they can learn lessons from perhaps some of these larger entities\nRight and that's what there is a future of the island there should have right now it says the governor statewide initiative I'm workforce and it's a strategy that we can all plug into and part of that is sharing those best practices of we put together at the business council business education alliance to kind of do what you're talking about so the\nBusiness education alliance has\nBusiness leaders but then also has two presidents of our region institutions to presidents of the community colleges to school kids are twelve superintendents and one president of a private college all at the table really talking about how do we worked together\nTo inform since the jobs to try to build the workforce in the future\nAnd and just kind of break down some of those barriers because it does take us all to look up from what we're doing and have that collaboration\nBut them hopefully we will develop some best practices that everybody can use so not just the big companies like you've talked about but small and medium size and companies as well and these will be programs that we hope that can be replicated around the state do\nThe people you work with have a sense of optimism as we know hit into the fourth quarter of this year or calendar year twenty Nineteen do they have a sense that things are on the right path with regard to their business and their employees and customers within the state\nSo we put together a quarterly economic survey that we've done for the last ten years and that survey is from our business leaders perspective an outlook of our economy and we are just about ready to release our most recent survey and our members are saying that I was a con I mean is that it's wrong is that it's been in ten years\nWhich is very positive to them what we look at is are they going to hire more people spend more capital investment within the communities um and within their companies but then we also asked him what are some of your barriers and it does continue to be workforce\nThat is a barrier a we had our memory Maine last week and we also had our business education alliance meeting and the conversation that keeps coming up is the fact that our population hasn't grown and if you look at our dashboard that's also one of our metrics that we take a look at and so how do we again start thinking about strategies to where\nWe can bring more people under the state uh or retain our graduates that are here we are universities do a pretty good job or a ... a lot of our graduate but how do we do a better job of keeping people in Iowa because we've got to increase that population in order to meet those workforce needs that we have\n[noise] in the cedar valley the greater cedar valley alliance and chamber has now started with their partner organizations that initiative about living the valley so that they can\nShow what a great quality of life it is and when we've talked about it they've said we would love to have people come here and then find a job that is unique because people usually go for the job\nAnd I just wondering maybe it's it's my inability to think outside the box but it would seem that\nIt's kind of a an interesting a cycle where you need people so that they can get jobs but they may not move without a job and it's hard to create a quality of life was that it it really seems a daunting task I guess\nIt is I Would tell you though I think the younger generation is coming up now within the workforce they are more willing to move somewhere without a job [noise] um because of the quality of life and that it provides an Iowa does provide a really strong quality of life for individuals\nBut within our membership and with the Iowa economic development authority we've had conversations again on how we all work together\nTo promote some of that more outside the state of Iowa suggest that great quality of life that we have and so then maybe they are interested in those internships that we have and what they get within the community and they get to know the culture of the company that they're working for and what the communities like through that internship them were able to keep him here in Iowa so it's kind\nOf that layer in effect\nA promotion having opportunities for them to be here and really just kind of encompassing people\nAnd convincing them that I was a great place to be when they're here\nI Know when I was teaching at the college level we would send in turns to places like Denver, Colorado and they would fall in love with it and they'll never come back and so we have to kind of turn that around and have a good quality of life and the climate for others to either experience here from in state and stay or import them as you note\nLet me as Leslie What is the greatest challenge to maintaining this uptick that we have seen I think you said the the survey we'll show it to the greatest climate in a number of years older than the workforce challenges\nDo we think this can sustain itself\nAre members continue to feel positive about it and that it will be able to ... and again I think the barrier that they would identify as workforce and I would tell you they also to our business education alliance one of the things that we want to project forward as you know if we want our economy to grow so much every year\nThan what is that workforce look like five years down the line and how do we start building that now so that we're not kind of playing catch up like a lot of people are at this time and it's not like we've talked about there's a lot of two year degree type positions that how do we start getting a pool of data analytics vote or a pool of people who are\nWater difficulties once again fifty four\nIn Waterloo Cedar Falls from the voice of eastern Iowa when he was talked Fifteen forty ... where the time and his two thirty nine\nIf you're more than forty years old you remember the great American road trip mom packed lunches dad packed wagon you left early in the morning and more than once your father irritated by bad behavior in the backseat said don't make me pull over but today's travel minute from our world travel ...\nThat's the title of a ... new book don't make me pull over it's written by Richard Reid say an advertising exact with a journalism degree who was the youngest of four kids in Wisconsin family\nThe subtitle of his book is an informal history of the family road trip and it'll bring back memories Ezra tae waves amusing anecdotes about the history of highway hotel chains the buildings of the nation interstate system and more like the fact that the Stuckey chain pick this locations by how long it's founder could drive until he had to use the bathroom\nAnd during his career bill stuck you would erect six thousand billboards on highways across the south as many as fifty for a single location made I remember the great banana

M. travel show Sunday afternoon at four on news talk Fifteen forty KFC can\nNews time approaching to forty two\nWe mentioned in our last segment the Iowa business council we've talked with air executive director Georgia van gundy and the survey that they commissioned of their members for the fourth quarter of this year was released earlier today\nAnd there is no question when you look at the graphs and you can see more at Iowa business council all one word spell it out Iowa business council dot org but you can see\nThat we're we're plowing some of the same ground here but it does show how important it is if everybody every organization everybody involved and industry says the same thing\nWhen I ask what are the current primary business challenges Seventy five percent of those responding set attracting developing and retaining a quality workforce Seventy five percent\nNone of them said access to a capital to Capitol was a problem none of them had problems securing funding but Seventy five percent said a good workforce was a problem\nAnother item that attracted a majority of those responding in terms of current primary business challenges the cost of product or service inputs and then obviously is a reflection of the global marketplace Seventy percent said that they expect their companies' sales to be higher\nIn the next six months\nIf you combine the higher with substantially higher which is by the way at least eight percent three quarters of those surveyed said they expect their sales to either be higher or substantially higher\nFive percent said lower and their capital spending will either not change at all or increase dramatically half of them would like to enhance their employment levels as well\nSo this is a really interesting number a lot of confidence in the economy according to these numbers\nAnd some further evidence that things are fine although perhaps not as robust as a month ago\nA new survey suggest the economy does remain strong in Iowa and eight other mid western plains states but business leaders are a little concerned about the ongoing trade dispute now again all of these surveys before\nThe agreement announced between Mexico the United states and Canada last night\nThe economic index and this is the uh mid America business conditions index that Ernie ... return guests to this program frequent guest on this program economist at great university Ernie is in charge of this\nThe overall economic index for the region including Iowa slipped from sixty one point one down to fifty seven point five last month\nBut Dr ... says he expects business will continue to grow in the next few months it will be slow but there will be continued growth rising interest rates also a problem but again the Ernie guy survey indicates that anything above fifty\nIs growth positive anything below fifty as growth negative so fifty seven point five may not be as robust as the month before but it is still grows and again this is all before the announcement made today\nLate last night was the first clue but the announcement made today that there will be not NAFTA two point oh it is the U.S MCA U.S Mexico Canada agreement
