early deficit to defeat number sixteen Oregon three to one number Seventeen produce swept Ohio State Missouri knocked off number eleven Florida\nRoad when for the tigers three to two and a number six feet of number Twenty one ... three to one plus an interesting natural just outside the top twenty five a couple of teams receiving votes UCF in Cincinnati battling for top spot in the American athletic conference and UCF rallies for up three to to victory\nUCF only barely receiving votes in fact most of the votes that have gone to UCF come from its own head coach\nNot to say that that's a bad thing you see it definitely is a quality team at for close to ten in the RPI budget nowhere close to that coaches top twenty five right now all Cincinnati was right behind you and I which is currently tops on the receiving votes category\nSo we'll see how those teams shakeout is going to be an interesting poll when it comes out tomorrow afternoon\nEspecially considering the fact there could be a couple of teams working the way into the top twenty five considering the fact that Baylor at twenty four places once this week and lost to Kansas State\nOn number Twenty one Kansas which

opponent number to market it wouldn't be strange to think of the un I could work its way into the top twenty five really the biggest question is those teams that could be falling out Kansas Baylor how many votes are they going to lose from that\nBecause it's one thing to be more or less twenty six in the country and know a couple of teams\nCould be slipping their way out but the Panthers were still about fifty fifty five points in voting from being at that twenty fifth spot\nIt'd be one thing if you when I was only a couple of points away from twenty five then you'd be pretty sure about even with the last day but yeah just one of the more interesting aspects to that poll it should be coming out tomorrow and that's usually about one forty one forty five central time on the American bobble coaches association website\nSo if you're able to beat us to it by\nAll means go ahead but we'll be keeping our eyes on it around the time and certainly posting updates on our Twitter about it in the
