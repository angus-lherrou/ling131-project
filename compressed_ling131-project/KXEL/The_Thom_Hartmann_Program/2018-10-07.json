Anderson director at Embry rentals eagle flight Research Center\nWhen it comes to show ... nice to conduct in the\nTraveling appreciate it a lot so we've got a lot we want to try and come with me so I'm going to get rid of him to this and I guess depending on who or what you want to believe\nMost of the sources out there that we've seen they're projecting commercial airline pilots shortages somewhere between twenty five hundred and five thousand as soon as twenty twenty so you know here in change you know we already have major shortages that we're seeing impacting most heavily the regional airlines an example is Greek Lincoln airlines shut down completely earlier this year\nSo what are you seeing and hearing out their path and do you agree with us that this was a serious issue that's going to impact all of those who fly in some way\nBut it is a very serious issue because we're going to need a lot more pilots the or the pilot population is aging or we have a significant wave of retirements coming up which is making this pilot\nShortage and we also see that the number of new pilots has dropped off some of that has been because of the airlines in previous years have been in a little bit of a wall and people didn't want to go into that area in that situation\nAnd those two things overlapping have made a significant shortage in the beginning of the pipeline of putting piled true as commercial airline pilots\nAnd another thing that we want to hit on on top of reason for the commercial airline pilot shortage usually have changed back and I think it was twenty Thirteen\nTheir rules to requiring minimum Fifteen hundred hours of flight time to compound a commercial flight it's been a controversial rule and resulted in ... really didn't think about it and about a six fold increase from past requirements so there are some exceptions obviously at the new military pilots who need seven hundred and fifty hours or some others\nHow do you feel about the Fifteen hundred hour rule and what do you think about some of the chatter that's out there that they may be looking to make some adjustments\nThoughts a it's a very interesting controversial as you said a lot of the things that it impacts all over the country is the fact that airline pilots can't go direct from their two hundred and fifty hour pilot rating er into an airliner and that has some good affects some bad effects\nAs it turns out it might be better from the safety standpoint\nUh although we're still working on the data are we try and be data driven about those kind of decisions\nAre and looking at how that impacts that they've got an airline the good impact that it has right now is is that those folks that have to go from two hundred and fifty hours up to the requirement for the airlines are going to end up being played instructors and if you think we have a shortage of airline pilots we even have a\nA more difficult problem with a shortage of piled instructors and so that population would probably be significantly smaller if this Fifteen hundred power will warn wouldn't be a there are and people were jumping direct to the airlines so it's sort of a double edged sword\nThere interesting I unpack I'd like to talk about and bring ran off clearly college leader and aeronautics and an aviation I can think of some other insights you think of that comes to mind and the rental clearly a high standard insurance unit versus expanding to allow more students into the school when are you seeing a noticeable\nIncrease enrollment students that are looking to become pilots [noise]\nYeah so we've been lucky we are at increased enrolling for quite a while a those have been small but noticeable increases this year we have a a very large upswing\nIn the number of aeronautical science students which are a pilot track students and we see that in engineering for aircraft so aerospace engineering and the other engineering associated with the whole aerospace community of building up the infrastructure for at the airports in our lives\nTo all sectors of the ... that's a good man I mean I'd like to get your thoughts ON Technology and they use of technology and whether it's attracting um\nYou know and these students as well to help with the shortage and rapid and I actually have a son and he's in Tech University in New York state and whenever I Can't pass or even talking to him he's always so excited and engage with what school is dealing with the technology and it's really impressive when it is and I would think it's a good time to be\nInvolved in this field and be getting into aviation and so what are you guys doing it and be able to connect with your students and and attract future pilots and as you said I'm an engineer and swelling aeronautics\nBy going to tell you it's a really exciting time and when I go in and teach classes or I'm sort of a little envious that I'm not sitting in the seats on the set up being up at the board because the new technology is going to bring about changes to to aviation are that are came to some of the movie as we've seen like avatar and your vendors\nAre some of these vehicles that don't look like a classical airplanes\nAre going to come out because of advances\nIn technology so it's it's a really vibrant uh area of designing a new airplane but I think the first one you're going to see is is urban air mobility which is the idea that we can take a water essentially very quiet or redone automated helicopters and use those to replace\nA taxis and we were like commission being able to fly in urban areas wow\nYou know I've seen some of the after I left a pack a little bit more here because back in may Bonnie send me the president of Jet Blue ventures she was an act upon herself she was on the program with us and we talked a little bit about one of the companies that they're supporting ... era which is essentially is developing regional electric aircraft\nSo with what you just said combined with what the Sunni Arabs doing how far along as this technology you know in a world where Tesla electric cars are now now they're getting our streets you know will it be that long before we are seeing electric Thomas planes flying or skies\nWell we're at the beginning of it but a lot of factors are racing this to an employer very quickly and much more quickly than I've ever seen\nThat in our industry so that they're doing with type thing is a a an airliner it's what we call them the whole electric airplanes are in that promises to bring down direct operating costs and ...\nAnd then the other side of that is these white little helicopters and what ties both of these together is we're pulling in the stuff that we've learned from the automotive industry\nIn hybrids and electric propulsion and using that in airplanes to do sort of the same things were were reducing the cost and emissions but we're opposite doing\nLike a high proportion and using that in airplanes do sort of the same thing or or reducing the cost of the mission but we're also doing it to make a mission that we couldn't do before so these are little helicopters all I have a bunch of little rotors we we couldn't have gas and that would do that\nSo liquor five the ocean and many different ways is allowing this large expansion a field of aviation\nI find that fascinating so I Would think that reducing emissions is one of one of the items that what are some other overriding implications that some of the electric an autonomous technology is going to have [noise] I guess in aviation but also for all of us here on the ground [noise]\nIt's kinda funny yet they are as than classically assertive in the certification of autonomous liking cold on human electrify propulsion\nThat has to be baked into that high already a little bit of a Trojan Horse or moving forward or the automation of airplanes that I'm Talking you know relatively sophisticated automation because\nUh most airlines right now have the capability of flying from as soon as they take out who when they land by themselves so we're talking about automation is the point of airplanes making decisions on wording and stuff like that I buy themselves and that was brought on by like five ... as well\nI I Love the technology and exciting you can hear the personal connection that you have the ... about it and I thought really it was interesting your comment about wishing that you were in the same versus the front of the board but\nPowell is really nice to connect with his anyway thank you very much for sharing your inside some thoughts we'll look forward to staying in touch with them having your back in the future because this clearly is going to continue to unfold\nI'm probably a little more rapidly than most of us like\nFor exciting time they\nCan't pass health care [noise]\nAlright mariners are overview on the pilot shortage situation and also just the technology and everything on a Friday Saturday and then yeah yeah the ... one of those little helicopters I think I I I for some reason that appeals to me more I don't know why how high they fly\nBooks right now
