[laughter] I knew I'd I speak German I should do what he called bag and threw in\nAwe of or is the co founder and owner of ... E L a travel company the terrain strips for people but also does what he calls surprise trips or surprising adventures really\nIt's a flexible budget option and we're going to talking about that now we find them on the street in Mexico city Nico welcome to show nice to have you here\nHi great to be here thanks where it\nAll right so let me get this straight someone goes to your website or cause you whatever and says surprised me and I know they fill out a questionnaire um but what do you have ... and you're going to take them away for a weekend or we can is is that is fixed amount of time or is that and then they go shovel\nWhat's right so the ideas and you said it's actual budget office and it's pretty much all suspects ability across across the board so what what are we kind of started their support travels a lot of people are more you have an idea of more or less what they want to do and how much they want to spend but not necessarily work to go\nAnd do a lot of people here to have that choice overloaded and you don't really know where to begin to research and so the idea is that there's a lot of packaged\nUm tours and and and ... pretty out there being sold online but there really isn't just a a questionnaire that you're just about yourself or it's kind of on questions like what you ... ... when you travel a little bit but structure you comfortable with\nUm what are you looking to do on that trip and and then you know you can kind of ... and ...\nWhere we started was applied strips jealous idea that you just got description of the photos and you can get a very solid ideas or you're gonna be experiencing but you don't know exactly where it is and of course if you have the question on the questionnaires ask you if there's any place that you've already been do you do want to go back through so you ensure that nobody has a rebate experience somewhere else\nAnd I presume you tell them whether it's a warm climate or is winter climate or whether hiking is involved in things so they can pack pack intelligently\nAttract like so we thought we could law curative um side which kind of tell the once they once they get so that's what they do to the ground running advocate for best practices out as well in terms of what's going to be ready for 'em so it's all to the ... cared for whatever confidence her face down\nAnd when did they learned their destination\n\nSo we have we send them a package where they are told to open at once they get to the airport so they know what time they have to be at the airport and then once I got there they open it and they get their flight number and get the word is going south Thomas is pretty pretty last minute\nAnd um and that's ... for for for the people that want something um something different so it's funny because we've got a lot of people that are well traveled that want somebody else but you also get the novice who just doesn't want to do any of the trouble finding himself or herself and just wants to outsource that whole experience I just I was a big job as many more excited\nMy guess is Nico ... he is the co founder and owner of a travel company called ... dot C. oh not that calm Nazi of human looking into something new bailed out to see how many folks have you taken or surprised with the niece of surprise adventures and how long have you been doing it\nSo we've been doing this for a return operating for two years now and we've sent a three hundred clients just about on supplies trips wow and\nThen tell me honestly as anyone call you back as a you know what that just wasn't what I had in mind\nSo excited we had won a only one negative experience but it was actually a great learning things because on the questionnaire um when you're when you're supplying your travel up and says you you're asked if you want a multi destination experience or if you'd rather spend more time uh one place and really immerse yourself fair so it's kind of a travel pays plush and write about solar path\nAnd also if you want to go to many defections is kind of stick around one and that was all tied up in age and I'm\nAnd third budget doesn't really allow for you know our country offering\nBy by ... by ... just on the ice on there was a Muslim nations in Iceland and the other day they watch your eyes but they\nHave they thought they were to go to some other countries as well under but disappointed but all their budget went to the ... what did I I mean this was part of our and he was like one of our first twenty trips that we did and it was definitely learning experience so that was the one negative Utah where\nUm we definitely have to adjust and make sure that we were asked you know we were getting ready to punish them for almost everybody that we know exactly where they walk and\nLuckily we're able to reach out and make it make it right by them but we actually something to the broad neck in August and we plan to um we sponsored the entire trip for them so they could have a positive experience that you will and and then you know thousands of dollars a night\nOf redemption they're nice reconciliation\nGreat idea well done Nicole good marketing one out of three hundred not bad so I I Know that we can get you think about a thousand dollars I Know there are companies to do this and charge twenty thousand for weekend um is is that a fair price about I mean is that can you expect and I expect to have a great weekend with you planning and surprising me for only a thousand bucks\n[noise] yeah so that's that's the average who I mean we we will will with lower budget you have so we've actually sent people anybody from you know executives have extremely high buses or anybody that wants more luxury experience to the to the hospital backpack or ... yeah it's really what we found it to go on there's the problem is that\nWe give you the luxury we'll give you out of the value added as a luxury travel agent but we are I mean\nBut we don't you know we we work with in your budget within your means and that's the idea because right now you know\nPlanning a trip 'cause there's there's a lot of options but luckily traveled more globalized never\nAs you know but if you want to really plan annexed oriental trip so I mean almost estimation trip but that really a boy and a bit of adventure culture nature peeper performers says you have to either do the research yourself and having a million times Oakland or you're going to travel agent and a lot of travel that there are good\nOutdated and unreliable depending on the travel here but usually they all to come up with very high price guide so the idea is that they were trying to make this kind of modern seamless experience of planning a trip from beginning to the ... and the budget really can vary depending on where it is you're looking for\nGun it will either you know I I I Love the surprise element and on your website you quote research to see who you say and I'm quoting you a lot of research has been

I emotions like\nFour hundred percent that feels good to be surprised if he'll make the travel imagined mixing to do is get me an example of of a trip you have to be off the charts incredible ... and and you know AAA you're really proud of the few curated for someone\nYeah definitely I mean we actually had a great a testimonial from somebody that actually wanted to they specified in there I generate that they were looking for something\nYeah definitely I mean we actually had a great a testimonial from somebody that actually wanted to get in there I generate that they were looking for

Copenhagen within that but in terms of like their travel south of what they want to look a lot of nature and a lot of nature they watch the Arctic abide by coasts as well so I think there are but\nWe took a chance that we're getting we're both old out of the ... are we ended up spending to Judge Walker and those those are the most satisfied\nOr reason also which was really like to hear goes about ... ... what we believe the premise of our trips that fact is is that they didn't have a chance to really cool it's almost before and I really do much research she she said that she was just there was at the bus surprised\nUm because you're just you never got to go to ourselves\nThat we made sure that she's you know I had the entire time that she knew that you're good at ... out of the trip was she was looking forward actually do their job and did it to be done for her you know got done as you do the although I guess all the surrounding shots or so that was really cool because those kind of a complete one eighty in terms of where she wants to go\nQuick last question meal of the few seconds left or most of the travelers couples are single travelers for the size of venture is\nOdd but majority of our lives are actually couples\nI Would think that would that would make sense well I I don't know how long how much advance notice do you like to have\nSo we typically take a trip records for two months in advance anything ... depending on the on the bus or we're usually tend to to ask him to come back later or to to to really get that started the possible\nOkay but I find it
