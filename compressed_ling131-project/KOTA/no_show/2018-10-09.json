California Adam what's on your way\nBefore I get to my comment I Want to mention that while I was on hold I became one of your patriotic\nFor thank you thank you yeah I appreciate you and I mentioned that I appreciate your passion demeanor and expertise and all that\nWe also record a a a little typically it's around somewhere between three and seven minute rant every week a video rant that is a private on YouTube and it's only available to people who are subscribe to a YouTube channel or who watches are or who are subscribers unpatriotic\nAnd threat to our Web support or YouTube channel so he'll have access to that now too and you know it's it's typically a pretty good pretty good rant what's up Adam\nIn a you know when you know uh what do you call it a or\nWhatever that has jurisdiction or whether it will be a federal court or a state court um\nAnd ah ... you know in the case of Bill Clinton and he had a suspension of one year suspension of his wall licensed by the Arkansas bar and so the individual bar association can suspend you know the individual state bar association is going to spend your ... and I think that the that the thing that Kavanaugh has to fear\nIs that if the Democrats launched an investigation into his wise in into whether he lied about the sexual assaults in the extent of his drinking and his life and what are now fairly clear lies about his involvement with the Trump it with the Bush administration\nAnd the torture and and we don't even know what else I mean you know all all the entire three year period of his time working as a ... man I mean there's this guy was a\nHe he was never a lawyer he was a by right wing hatchet man whether it's for Ken Starr whether it was for George W. Bush he didn't work as well you know I I mean you could say worked as a lawyer and that he was getting legal advice\nBut he he was not you know try and cases in courts of law and things like that and he went from being a right wing hatchet man right to the DC circuit\nAnd then he's going from the DC or anyone directly from the DC circuit of the Supreme Court see now I have a guy in the Supreme Court has never argued a case before the Supreme Court in fact the best of my knowledge out maybe early on in his career like in the first year at a law school or something but the best way knowledge she's never or certainly argue to consequential case before any court at all\nAnd you know he's just been a right with we're right wing hit man\nAnd so the thing that he has to fears impeach uh in the impeachment provision of the constitution applies to all federal officers that includes federal judges that includes members of the U.S Supreme Court and in fact one member of the U.S Supreme Court Mr chase back in Eighteen oh six or something\nOr was impeached in the house of representatives they did not convict him in the center so\nThat's the thing that he has to fear and it would take a sixty six ... votes in the Senate to make that sticks so I don't think he has a lot of fear around that Jerry thanks a lot for the call a may in Avondale Virginia Amy what's up\n[noise] Hi I'm I wanted to mention that I Believe this when you were talking about the intolerable consistent lives that are coming out of the president [noise] um I Believe the method is called fire hosting ... and I think it's also used by prudent when suddenly I'm\nProbably it seems like every strongman all around the world\n[laughter] apparently so uh it's a matter of obliterate ing the foundation of the truth so that um they're truth can be super imposed over top of that and of course you see in the massive confusion no one knows what to believe\nAnd uh it's a very very sad thing because especially in the disarming of um the office itself\nBut uh as you were mentioning about trusting each other as neighbors and news and I presume that also goes with your relationship with us\nThat uh we have the responsibility of trying to find good resources that we know that we can trust that are truthful and to you know a check those things often and share it with those that we know that we can share that with\nUm and I really appreciate your time and I'm mentioning all these things to us that you find\nMy pleasure there is all by the way of somebody called earlier and said is there a Web site the list all of the candidates and what they have voted for and what their status isn't all that\nHe has hope they did that website yeah several people treated\nToo many votes smart dot org now this is not a site I'm familiar with and I haven't had a chance to check it out it's apparently funded by one guy who's got a video of himself on the front page I don't know what his politics are I don't know how accurate it is but there have been a number of people who have Twitter to to me here since we started the show so it's absolutely\nNecessary because in the midst of what I consider a corporate to um you know they found they can play both sides and when that happens you know who do you vote for who do you trust who do you believe and I honestly believe that also that ah you know see what they do not what\nThey say well and this is going to be a good example\nYeah and this is the reason may why why we have seen voter participation go from you know as high as sixty Seventy percent back in the nineteenth century down to about a thirty thirty and thirty in the thirties or during a congressional mid term elections\nHere in the United states is because one up for a lot of people they're looking at a corporate Republican versus a corporate Democrat and their children their shoulders and yeah there are even than differences I mean Heidi Heitkamp is still a hell of a lot better than any Republican Joe mansion for that matter is a hell of a lot better than any Republican\nBut you know a lot of people are saying you know the differences are not great enough to get me off my bought and that's why the parties need to get their people love may thank you for that then the fire hose in thing and once again that a website it's called votes smart\nDot or again and again I'll I'm going to look at it when I get off the air I Want to have time until then but uh it looks like it might have what what people are asking about Heather in Taos New Mexico Heather what's on your mind to them\n[noise] um yeah I've been asking this question or a round of my friends and I haven't got an answer what in regards to the FBI\nAnd investigation on Kavanaugh what would happen\nTo Denver Democrat did say what was really in that um investigation apparently their hands are tied their mouths are shot during its under lock and key and what what would happen if one of them just said what they saw um\nI'm dancing since the FBI only interviews nine people I Believe it was [noise]\nAnd yeah and all of them said essentially I don't know I don't want to get involved I don't remember anything\nOn that there's nothing there that this juicy enough to bother leaking which is why hasn't leaked the what we need and their actual investigation were the FBI doesn't have handcuffs put on by Don McGahn and Donald Trump and another thing that Donald Trump lied to us all about\nAnd and you know actually looks into this and frankly if the FBI can do it because the White House prevented them\nIf the Democrats take the house of representatives Ted Lieu has already promised\nThe hardcore right winger um you know Donald Trump last night Donald Trump said Democrats have proposed legislation of open borders these wind through his teeth no Democrat with him and do that and a Democrat supports that Don he's been line about Brett Kavanaugh saying you know the that uh this is entirely fabricated and it's been entirely debunked\nOr the neither those true to what extent will right wing hate radio on Fox News um both owned by billionaires I should point out um to what extent should they be able to deliver more victories to the Republican Party versus\nYou know the angry and upset or women and the allies of women across the United states who are looking at this as the last gasp of patriarchy\n[noise] ... yeah I don't think that box you know cares of course because look who they just hired as their communications director Hope Hicks\nOh really and the White House has bill shine who is supervising the Kevin ... who himself has been accused of sexual harassment\nIt's a switch you know you got shrine and then all of a sudden Hope Hicks now goes to Fox and Hope Hicks was in the White House or as we know you know and a\nVery very close to the president's daughter so I don't think Fox is really looking to ... in any fashion perform have itself has it you know a fair entity or any stretch imagination they will however do what they just did which is to produce\nFor the Republicans especially the right will produce a lot of cover a lot of you know a of a new slanted towards that direction and but I Will point now even\nWith that occurring I got a lot of money behind it which helps what does that help it helps Republicans that are a sure how they're going to vote\n... because you see what I'm saying them bases ginned up to buy\nThe use of money to the corporate media\nSo similar to the question in my mind it you know after Ninety two after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill ...\nThere were a lot of women who got elected Ninety two and um [noise] uh and Bill Clinton got elected Ninety to ... ... what\nWhat do you expect steel like the the political consequences of this will be in terms of truly elections\nLets the great question because here's what I think's going to happen I'm and I'm going to refer to President Obama for how it's carried out to happen but what I think's gonna happen it's first of all\nTheir protect people protecting suggests the right question about you know all the money spent and it's pumped out there and you got a lot of protection and people are watching boxing cetera they give you a protection in your in your base even with senator mansion for example\nThe base it would be calm down even though Mitch McConnell still after him because of his boat you know now having said that the repercussions I think we're going to be pretty easy there is a no matter how they comforted the wrote for the vote\nAlright for cap and all the roads going to be very difficult because there is a definite gender gap and the way you look at it including a Republican a female voters not supporting Republicans are Gerald there is a gender gap any way you look at number two\nThere is also a an independent gap now who are up for grabs who may have not went for Hillary Clinton but went for Donald Trump\nThen you come to ... up\nThe conservative base let me think is very important and this would worry me if I was sitting Republican\nAnd a half amount of having that\nThe conservative base fired up but they're happy so they may stay away the progressive base is fired up and they are unhappy so therefore if they produce people to get out and vote\nThey will have some do you think this is a mirror image of the Tea Party the are\nAll these Republican activists on the streets yelling and screaming and it produced a wave of elections for Republicans now you've got the you know a bit of women and their allies out in the

run Ilan mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's why\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine it\nStands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred two hundred the two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um well my ... about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe the machine so\nYou you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no then the machine can never undo what a person can do\nA technological how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nStaggering it really is\nThe thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but\nBut there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there but does any thinking at all it's it's one was in the rose manipulated in memory turned on and off or at the speed of light\nIt's done with with relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for

doesn't speak any Chinese\nBut people outside the room slide questions written in Chinese under the door to the Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks them up\nLooks at the first character on

wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know you you still a drink\nYou know the robot kept a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming that you have a special order and you want you want to send your back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the Russians were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills then thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning but your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do with a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nThe correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be a 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for decades to come\nUh people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of move but you're not going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over big yourself where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way

that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative whether a computer can\n... it may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and that it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do at ... let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness\nAnd people said we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just make a worm and listen to the computer with a brain a three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's\nPossible so there are so many we we're so spectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe someday we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book to fourth age because you believe we've had three ages beak already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying when we were able to do\nAnd and\nWe used to overcome scarcity because we're a law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we\nLearned something so big and knew that it just changed the trajectory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nBy what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know do man that was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate in the ... couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize in I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave his prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we've gotten writing and when those two things happen you invented a nation state and that's why ... years ago you kind of shut your clock by all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia NSO America and just the boat all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence that robots\nAre another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action to put it in a machine and and and multiply us both of you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it\nImagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter Mm I don't I Can't predict what that's going to with what's going to do but it's going to be a big one well\nWe know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with the mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can't ah coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottom\nHumans can't do it that fast or you're ... you're right that dog official intelligence it it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like ... and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we know not at all\nNot at all and has displaced workers\nProbably\nYou can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\nRight and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment long time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen\nEighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year or two you every year you you put a million more workers and and yet that didn't\nMake unemployment go up either it was just new technologies more people are more jobs more well more prosperity so I think these ... I think anything that multiplies human ability as\nA few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is then you should sport a law\nThat makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back 'cause instantly you create under the new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything but our productivity will plummet and so that's what technology is just like a third arm that means you can do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's pick it up by going to Jackson, Tennessee welcome to the program to get us started hey Jeffrey go ahead hey I\nTaught in the fall and I love the ... thank you ... out and not not but I Want to fly so that that the ... and fire [laughter] than I Am right here I tell you what they don't have them back down his show\nWell don't say that don't say that but what what's wrong\nFilm I Am disabled out on a slow it that had to say that\nJobs are bankrupt the technology backpacking out the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs right I mean look at\nYou you can look at the un unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work or almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring\nI'm\nYou know technology always empowers people to be able to do more\n... there was this kind of like an infinite number of jobs you\nYou can make a job instantly the minute you take something a ... and you apply labor and technology to it\nYou make something worth more than ... and whatever value you were able to add that to wage and because technology lets you do more technology increases wages it it's really rough\nWhen it when it happens in a localized area and uh so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of shake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of the facilitating that\nUp because you know you can say well it's all going to work out in the long run but people live in the short run and and that's that's hard and and so we we got to be very mindful of that how we treat people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but it turned against technology to say\nSomehow knowing how to be more productive as bad for for people or I think it's a hard case to make\nI'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers are there are hardworking

with us author of the fourth age Byron Isaac Asimov three laws robotics let me quickly go through them and tell me how they would really transform into artificial intelligence\nWon a robot may not enjoy a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except we're such orders would conflict with the first law\nThree a robot must protect its own existence is the longest such protection does not conflict with the first or second law\nSo what are you saying is is robots can't injured human beings at any cost that is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers that are robotic\nYeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the laws are are\nA literary device so you can tell the story they don't actually get us very far um you know if I'm going to do something dangerous\nPotentially are myself does the robot according to those laws that are being stopped meaning the by the by older it's like a desert or and I got to the extra pounds on me to throw out say no you cannot the desert is that's going to hurt your guy that said you got to protect\nExactly I'm monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whatever\nIt exactly exactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots is no two people kind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't and even if you just said well we're just\nPick you know Joe\nAnd make use Joe's moral code for all the robots even Joe's moral code is like full of provide those and well you don't do that unless it's this but if they're all they're all of these is\n... and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots behave that way and like you said there's a lot of a sudden it's with a mutt too\nIt was a robot out

process\nWe were literally under a salt demonstrators us hush sure some of them or woman and citizens many of them were obviously trying to get in our faces to go to our homes up there to basically almost a tacos and the halls of the capital\nSpeaking to an audience in his home state of Kentucky McConnell said his pockets was undeterred\nA zero tolerance for that kind of by the justice Kavanaugh was accused of but I think it's important to remind everybody that there was no corroborating evidence\nJudge Kavanaugh who is now officially justice Kavanaugh was accused by multiple winning a sexual misconduct all of the allegations stemmed from when Kavanaugh was in high school and college Kavanaugh denied each and every allegation McConnell says she couldn't be prouder of his pocket for sticking by the nominee\nWe were standing up for the presumption of innocence in this country\nWas comments came two days after Brett\nAnd I was confirmed in the U.S Senate by a voter fifty to forty eight only one Republican Lisa Murkowski voted against confirmation only one Democrat Joe Manchin voted for\nDemocrats objected to the confirmation process from the very beginning\nAnd reminded that majority leader that he blocked President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from even getting a hearing and then he left his seat on the Supreme Court open for almost a year then he rushed to the confirmation process for Kavanaugh would undo haste\nDemocrats say it was now his actions that poisoned the entire process and McConnell defensive actions\nBut what I did was entirely consistent with American history going back to the Eighteen hundreds of what happens when a vacancy occurs in the middle of a presidential election year and you have one party and the White House and another party in control was\nWhen he do it again it's practical uh think about it there's no chance that an opposition party is going to be in control of the Senate is going to fill a Supreme Court

appeals in San Francisco the most liberal court in the United states\nAnd it's also the will show return a and I think there's there are a couple of gun case down there are I Believe there is also going to be a new challenge to the Jersey a concealed carry\nA scheme that they have going back there\nOr maybe Maryland will come up to a there are several states with very restrictive concealed carry statutes and with the a more conservative more are constitutionally oriented Supreme Court I think some of those laws are going to come under what we call strict scrutiny and we'll see how

longstanding regulations such as concealed carry and felon in possession laws\nHeller established at the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans on regulations is determined by reference to text history and tradition unquote then judge Brett Kavanaugh your thoughts on how this will carry forward into of cases before the Supreme Court\nWell I think that gives us a hint of where a a justice Kavanaugh is going to come down on Second Amendment issues he understands are that are all rights can be regulated to some degree but\nThey're not government regulated privileges and certainly the second amendment is not a government regulated privilege it is a\nFundamental constitutionally protected right and I think from from reading what he said in that historic descent I thought it was ... you get the\nImpression that he is going to come down on the side of the individual right to bear arms even outside the home a with a permit they they they were really forced by the courts to create a concealed carry system in the district of Columbia District but\nUh again it's not above being challenged again in the courts and you know that may be a case that comes before the high court to eventually\nIt has been a while since we've had a major Second Amendment issue before the Supreme Court despite the fact that there have been any number of uh uh such

one of them is John Solomon Sarah Carter Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking ...\nBut you know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you bring your backwards a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it at the structure\nOf the four she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen\nLong before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peters drop one of the interviewers a man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the capital issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James Cole me\nOh he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney or the company Perkins ... at the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money reporting the dawn of

I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the\nCampaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice we're doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the fight to warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the Pfizer warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary is without a Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a finds the application to spy on the Trump campaign\nIt wouldn't be fusion GPS or dot CA on Trump we wouldn't be living through its second year of endless Trump Russia investigation with no evidence whatsoever because Democrats cynically launched the whole thing the ruined Donald Trump's presidency and set 'em up for impeachment\nAnd the news story that we have outbreak in this morning proved just that\nJames bakers tests the testimony is blockbuster and I don't see anybody in the

threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job authority the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and speeding I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is it\nWell it's I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is a ... one of covered a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and ... are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three to four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area the weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast and I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place\nThat strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean look the average person including me has no idea why the actual\nAngle of the ... when it reaches land matter so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western\nAtlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely I said well what does it have to do with us well when the action stops there like a dead last year it shifted into the Atlantic base and and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff coming to three\nWeeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to camp or whatever I can say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got the last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get I'm writing about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the nice over there with war this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Lawrence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between K Patterson Norfolk go right out to see in the south of New England no problem in the northeast from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts the hurricane force\nThe outer banks and and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia ... or ... places like that as it moves north it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nAnd you folks over there you ... you got and he remembered the way the northeast uh that that bite of Florida shape\nEven though to the east Appalachian coal or are they win won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water that's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and do that by to Florida I think Tallahassee probably going to get wind gusts eighty Ninety miles an hour they're knocked the power out in Tallahassee during hurricane K which went very close to the Ninety percent\nOf the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or what this there I'm no I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least the gusts with this and we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon drawing a possibility tornadoes\nAre from Florida and then through southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary All right so what are we get landfall and know what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on the coast bend and there are a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and it's but there are a lot of homes right on the water\nOut between three and nine PM tomorrow thinks one we're going to have land fall and I think things are really going to deteriorate\nVery very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday an afternoon in there you just got to get out I mean well you know again what parts you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds there was a bad storm it was spread out\nThis is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and look folks\nYou can see what's going on with this\nYou saw with war and Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the clock photograph the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter and that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast there's well\nThere's nothing magical about it and I will I wrote I wrote down this weekend I mean I I Know that sounds pompous but you got people say we've never seen anything like this already starting with the climate ambulance chaser\nThis has been telegraph so far in advance\nAnd even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem coming up into the Gulf of Mexico and if it was going to be what we call rapid rapid development feedback we feed that happen every now and then\nAnd we're fortunate with a Lawrence set of ... as you know it was ... this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do and given the ideal situation that is what is it\nSo it really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own your website actually so you have a hitting land it's really going to start getting rough about noon tomorrow with a little before\nRight and that and then the the landfall I think at some time between three and nine PM in Panama City will get that down and they I Believe maybe on with the on TV Tonight we will be honing in on this we got a lot of people in that area of course you know as you've been Harper and about what twenty eight days away\nAnd we all we watch it you know people that listen I appreciate let me be beyond here want to take care of your down there but we want you to listen and get the heck out of there if you order it out of there because it's a bad storm\nNikki Haley making the announcement

directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel that was just in the timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein\nSaid to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office are making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account to lawmakers this month clearly complicates and already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the O. J. and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both for ... what apparently now James Baker upset about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nReg Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hopes thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we've got a first start with the ... and the timeline is may twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... leads the page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaked strategy that had to do with the ... see a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and they got rid of all was was the ... recycled the different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously\nTaping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office that sounds like a cool to me\nWell if if it was one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from page ... among the other day and they still have no evidence to get a ... a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump our bias read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting dreams communist being roses are McKay\nAnd a stroke compared it hey maybe we can remove this guy for rather be re can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove these incompetent and will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording in the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... I'm sure record talking about the history book lays out a real possibility that this was a softer right look at this we have the FBI not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page is only\nSeven while at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nSystems that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved with her she's got the FBI and the jeopardy journey general\nAllegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and uh it no matter which way are coming down it's just another example of how far down the road the FBI was beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes and stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents at all look this is John group of role power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field officers purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know it was so angry about those because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them and say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials with the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nHeaters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein action\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup up using in misusing\nTheir power in the law to remove a sitting president ... here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president\nTo gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devin Nunes and said oh I was misunderstood and now in his attempted coup of the president who's on the evidence indicates he is saying oh I was misunderstood it was my words were misinterpreted it was just sarcasm\nThere is a pattern of conduct you're\nOn the part of\nThis man Rod Rosenstein to why hasn't the president fired him even though Rosenstein richly deserved the holidays the president recognizes that was the fallout and just before an election\nAlso the guy that signed the fourth and final of buys a warrant in other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and leads a page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation\nAll corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to see color is secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she said something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with leads a page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it\nBigger and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nIs pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have said in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week and the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired using GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... name dot CA that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a\nBuys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a buys a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though the information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers a guy by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael Saltsman handy to Baker documents about Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton at the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance of the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer Warren\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI ... weren't under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign was feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI sort appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying\nFor Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications gone Solomon and write Garrett continue with us anything I'm saying here that is\nWrong right Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the the OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele to compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony\nOpposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed they doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nTo drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe memos evidence seen this soft coup attempt by\nRod Rosenstein being given to Congress they've been given to of all people Robert Mueller Rosenstein is Mueller's boss give Mueller is going to be investigating Rosenstein\nFor illegal illicit activity you can see the mall still the boss in this case and the timing of this tells us everything John his was revenge for the firing of James Comey this is part of via listed scheme differing Donald Trump\nGood title for a book I guess that's why it's number one that John column and I want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure Mitt some details here but I Am I'm given the best summary I count it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the laughter and be astrological can and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misuse for a political opposition research projects to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nBase with fame investigation that was designed to hand for his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part Baker divulge and in the middle of my story but I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well drive a\nBaker gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after Trump when the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones gears a new version of a ... year coffee coffee it's different from the one the FBI has from steel\nAnd gives it to Baker and Baker turns it on to the a counter intelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter to be getting evidence the FBI we're we're supposed to report facts not become snitches but more and\nThe timing of it is so important the FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking um uh the existence of the investigation and all the dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them and here it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor\nTo continue to receive information for Christopher Steele\nThis is not how the price of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation ... given several key revelations\nI Won the challenges the credibility of roses seen one that shows the media um uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three as a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer and turning on evidence pressuring the FBI bigger and what happened in that time front\nChristopher Steele July twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and you're you get turned down they don't act on them right away they they they're not excited about it a few days later he goes to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department\nSanta foreign I'm using mass give people that want to call you can find one\n\nOne is you know passing it on dot com\nAT T O T H it's thirty five degrees\n[noise]\n\nAren't as we continue John Solomon of the hill investigative reporter Greg Jarrett number one New York times best selling author of the Russian hoax of pony Russia investigation was based on her own verified aren't are operated\nBought and paid for Dr ...\n... of the all the media elite strategy to destroy Trump before the election oh hookers and a bad urinating and the and the rich and Moscow\nAnd then literally leaking strategically to get the special counsel make you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke\nSo that there would be right buyer\nAnd all the FBI guy they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning with a page even have to buy into that fact that's right I mean\nYou cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources so launched ending up counterintelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet Sean that is exactly what the FBI and the D. O. J. did and what you\nGot ... there's a you know there's a guy that I had a few weeks ago they didn't get a lot of attention the nondescript guy but his name is bill priest that\nHe was beat strokes boss he was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told he told the congressional uh a committee\nThat at the time they were submitting the five and using that information for Christopher Steele ... they had just gotten vetting and they had any better and yet the standard for the fight it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court Greg ... you're right\nThey they began to substantiate for profit and yet they're using it presented as their stance jaded verified record when you look at these\nThe point they willingly lied before by the airport in light of it than to buy the court application and they also purposely withheld key information like back then Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOh you know just the fights alone\nIs deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power dose of perjury because they signed off on it or under penalties of perjury it's obstruction of justice\nIs also a conspiracy to defraud the government to fight the court is\nIn existence because of winter we had all these by the applications beyond that the president said he wanted the class or either non redacted\nWhen are we going to get the
