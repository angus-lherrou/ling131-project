another dog ...\nAnd again uh you know they think this is perfectly fine they think they're entitled to this and that's where the country's coming through and it's a sad day when when that's the way people think that public discourse should be held\nWell again we're teaching these young people that this just as the normal course of business this is just the way you interact you shout you know FU

but\nYou don't have to get physical you don't have to threaten someone and again it it it uh it's sad when you know what a member of Congress goes out and says uh this is the way you should protest is you know getting people's faces confront them\nUh it's not civil it's not right it's not the way I was raised and I guess some people are just raised differently in terms of what they think is

of money who are unhappy that Donald Trump became\nPresident and by any means necessary they will attempt to derail his agenda but not with substance with again these types of stunts\nOh oh absolutely uh Laura ... in the media is the right front and center on this I'll tell you I've you know I was comma position and I watch the testimony and my comment was it was pretty clear that Dr Ford is a troubled person and I think anybody who\nWatch the testimony comes up to that conclusion and she admitted that she has had psychological issues\nI said that in a in a in a interview\nI was accused of saying I said that she couldn't be trusted now I didn't say that but\nThat's the that's what the media water portray\nHave an agenda and and that's that's what's so different now than Thirty years ago the agenda is so obvious and so there\nAre many many members of the media this president thank goodness is speaking out against it or you know calling calling it a lot of space and uh that has that

people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmates and I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed themselves\nAnd then we all watch Julie sweat Nick all third shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug in your women so you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not during the investigation is that I don't think that you would expect that I did\nI mean all you're following of the ... you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite to the core operation people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all let a war that didn't happen that way at all\nSo the judges are college roommate and seeing on that and the last twenty four hours a talking about ah the judges drinking I honestly I I think this is horrendous for policy side and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible for the predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show and they found one yet or something of course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but I also believe that the FBI should have been allowed to do a full and fair and this guy and and that is why you're going to see on the land a huge out for a while and I understand that but she is energizing itchy on paying I Know\nIt's a talking point what was going to hang on a second I Want you interview looking in the case of professor for\nThe for people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness that didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else is the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of\nFelony and all they did is reiterate those statements to the FBI what else could they possibly do Daniella Ninety Days\nToday and we have Susan Collins and senator snowflakes saying that they are satisfied at the comprehensive investigation of the FBI Lisa Murkowski saying the hasn't had time to read it\nDemocrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI what were they supposed to do is set to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we say hyper Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up and spend most of my life in Arizona where most of my family still\nAnd I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a a good heart but I really feel like he's got played here by the Democrats and the law and I just really really hope that uh that he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see uh do you get people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize them and I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like that's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes ... when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if you had to face the voters he had some hope not [laughter] I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the same guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you don't look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we're we're actually related or I think it for three or four generations back our great great grandfather here is actually the founder of you know for the Arizona which I thought you would really love\nTo know somebody told me that yes one of their Mike record but really you know there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\n... I Hope it goes the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delight they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here\nAnd all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that is common Susan Collins common theme to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations of a problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we've we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward\nIn terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark I'm not having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious and we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\nNow shall not bear falls\nWitness against the neighbor because it's devastating\nBut the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he has been accused of and yet in spite of the factors but no corroboration shifting stories and a media hysteria that's ... that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years the racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all the things that come out as a matter of of course because that's their playbook I don't know I um I I\nSome house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some\nPoint we may need to say you're going to make these girl\nAnd accusations against individuals you better be able to prove it because if you can't prove it then you ought to be held financially liable because re Donovan once famously said where do I go to get my good name back after he was run through the ringer in the Reagan years I don't know how you get your good name but\nYou know I I Know Clarence Thomas I met Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas has the best lap of any human being I've had I've met in my life\nYou read his book my grandfather's son than you are going to be done that the life lessons you can learn from that book\nAnd what he went through it still comes up twenty five years later and I would say there's two things we need to change legally in the country we're gonna tort reform of any kind loser pays you want to sue and you'll lose you got to pay for the trial and the second is I think slander laws in the country\nNeeds to be adjusted as well you cannot just say anything about a public figure and the bar is so high that you actually have to get into somebody's mind to prove\nThat they didn't have any malice whatsoever\nThat it's an impossible standard to ever meet and I'm not even saying look I expected in my life my career and happens all the time but um I signed up for this dish it out four hours a day but I don't think Brett Kavanaugh signed up for this when he agreed to\nAccept the president's prestigious nomination to the U.S Supreme Court not this\nNot what the kids have gone through now with his family have gone through anyway Brandon thank you appreciate it a eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number ... uh Michelle was in North Carolina next Michelle happy Thursday glad you're with us welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nThe shot at all they can continue on to say I absolutely agree with you I think something one of the reasons why they're so desperate that we all read\nSex is because the Democrat has systematically raised all the checks and balances between the three branches of government they're now using the judicial system at a weapon against that do our own set of service and it's time for us to stand up and said\nCan make a law firm asked me fell off the land we had they would they\nHurt that we've gone against police officers and it's all the systematic now they want for us to try cases\nIn the court of public opinion and that is not how the United states has run the United states is a different country because of our laws and because of our judicial system and because of our law enforcement agencies and if we can uphold those we will fail to be a constitutional republic and movie no better than any other
