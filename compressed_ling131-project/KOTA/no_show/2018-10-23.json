I'm my primary concern is the fact that Rick Scott when he came into office change that three here waiting period for um felons\nTo five years and it only took four votes in order for that to become the legislation so if we're going to elect\nA governor who did this right after he became the governor\nFor no apparent reason what is he going to do as a senator or greater cause not to vote for him\nYeah among out you know take these things into consideration\nYeah a lot along with the fact that uh he made ... in fact a ... we've got that Rick Scott ad we need to chew that\nThing up and and play it I don't know how quickly all you can you'll be able to pull it up but there's there's a there's a a a new anti Rick Scott ad out that is just absolutely amazing here here it is when they play it for you a chance to\nRich Rick Scott get rich Medicaid Medicare Scott\nHell yeah we know that crime in dollars for a lot of it'll go got got three hundred million dollars is he was forced out the door and we got to let them start to learn a witch hunt restarted\nAt at that volume level because I don't think people can hear 'em\nQuite an error throated Rick Scott get rich answer ripping off Medicare\nAs the c._e._o. Scott ran a healthcare company that much find one point seven million dollars for Medicare fraud that's got got three hundred million dollars since he was forced out the door and governor\nScott even richer making five hundred and fifty million dollars on one transaction hidden from the boat everywhere he's gone Rick Scott has doubled his own bond Rick Scott you just can't trust\nSo there's a Bill Nelson add so Jan is that a is that ad and making you know have you seen that on the air and Florida is it is a out there or is it just or something I picked off the Internet\nAll the absolutely he has so much money that he can take their ways at any time that he wants free sky concern is that if we can if it takes for people in our state to vote\nTo allow people not to get their voters rates\nAnd that hasn't been reinstitute it and that we need to repeal the Eighteen eighty six or whatever it was\nOf um felons having their voters writes removed right you know there's no reason we need to start saying why should you lose your voters' rights ever yeah if you if you go to jail and you're you're paying the time for the crime that doesn't have anything to do with your voters right yeah\nYeah absolutely Jen thank you for the call and thanks for reminding me of the weight and we've been we've been sitting on the sad since last friday I maybe Thursday even I intended to play it and then just you know things happen to them we are busy and and uh you know I space to Scott in Portland, Oregon listening ... Scott what's up\nFrom thanks um I just wanted to put it out if you're if you're in Oregon we have vote by mail yeah I voted him got on the might I voted on Saturday\nYeah and if you don't even I don't even know if we should call vote by mail because I've had people say oh I don't want to put it the stamp on it you don't have to there's all kinds of places that you can drop us an infamous libraries um there's even look you know the Hollywood district\nHere in Portland there's a drive through a window at the mc Donald's but housing official ... county ballot box updated ... yeah it's pretty amazing but\nThe other thing I was but we we still get him scammed by punishing so one thing that I felt was could they put like a ... a soup of some kind of a number or you know one of these things tag each boat boats and then posted online so you can look up your ballot him see how it was cast\nThere are proposals to do that using block chain technology right and a on which may call it a lot of sense and ... you know of course the banks are starting to use block chain technology now and and are not for currency but for transactions\nNBS Mohammed bin Solomon and he's telling him the trans parrot I Can't say that the president is backtracking but obviously they're starting to make statements that you know are are talking about some lies and deception but still defending the crown prince and some issues are coming\nAnd some stories about Norm Coleman the former senator who's doing lobbying for Saudi Arabia and so a lot of of numbers and money that the Saudis have spent as coming now Norm Coleman is attached to a pack that is a supporter by Speaker Ryan\nSo of course he you know some of the of the money what do you what do you think\nOf this conspiracy theory that's been floated that you know the murder happened on October second by the night of October second\nUh eight or ... it would have happened in ... very very early in the morning our time on October second I'm so by the end of that day our intelligence agencies knew what was going on you know both from direct knowledge and probably by a Turkish\nIntelligence and the very next morning Nikki Haley sat down and wrote a letter of resignation um ... do you think that it's possible that sheen she pays attention to the intelligence a Trump doesn't get his intelligence briefings anymore and the CIA has no interest in them inside watches Fox News but Nikki Haley actually reads the intelligence briefing\nDo you think that she went to or that it's possible that she went to the Trump Administration whether it was Donald himself or whether it was\nIn a bowl or somebody like that and said hey this is going on and this is going to blow up in our faces this is really\nGrow any I don't want to have anything to do with this and we need to get ahead of us and they said oh no no we're going to be just fine we're going to we're going to protect the Saudis oh they'll cover this up don't worry and at that point being the very very smart politician that she is Nikki Haley said okay I'm I'm getting the hell out of here well\nYou know Tom there's no doubt that Nikki Haley has some sites on the White House down the road there's no doubt that people would like to see her on the Republican side you know to run obviously\nA poor president I think that it's very possible what you just said combined with the fact of John Bolton and I also believe uh some of the theory that\nShe knows that John Bolton was attempting to begin a war with Iran\nAnd if you look at the president's statements well we need Saudi Arabia to fight Iran no we don't we don't Saudi Arabia can't even find his way out of a wet paper bag they can bomb\nYou know kids in other countries but they can't um a fight\nSo we don't need them to do that I think that's part of it she may have had access to this information also and just became tired of the whole scenario because you have to look at something look at what the president said when he\nMentioned this might be broke he used the ... the word rogue before Saudi Arabia is the word rogue\nAnd you know she had access to this is information that might have been the straw is set her over the edge or to get out and I think Bolden is a big\nKey factor in this a key factor with it the deal going on right now with Russia and the agreement so I I think anywhere you go you're going to see naturally\nYou know his his fingerprints and with the Saudis they're close there is a business relationship Gary ... been on the phone costly I Am predicting that some of the people that have now been arrested\nWill confess that the crown prince and the and the royal family had nothing to do with this which is I take a complete lie\nNothing to do with it then those people will be beheaded why would they can fast cars are threats to kill their own family this thing gets Saudi Arabia the royal family it's going way deeper business connections you\nKnow pushed her entire nine yards but the use of the word wrote before the Saudis used it I thought was kind of coordination\nAnd weren't they weren't there wasn't of course our family bailed out by air uh money I'm I'm not sure it was Saturday I thought it was from a ... but it's basically\nKind of the same thing is yes and do all refused to him and then you're off the show he got in trouble for bad mouth and the President Bush's

protect its people but also it controls its people by having a a monopoly or near monopoly on force\nAnd I'm In the ... um\nBut you know I I don't think that I mean ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be a the rich that can go to Mars well\nI'm ... it's frankly easier to get rich that to become an astronaut on line and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go\nAnd um you know the\nThe once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know and now everybody knows\nWhat about ... we're we're going to do better than the kind of proportion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets but um if we could create air breathing proposed and that can operate at those needs a bake\nLaunch vehicles to become much more efficient because most\nOf the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not you know\nIf you get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit um that's going to require some um\nTechnological advances but you know who knows uh the you know the next new kid on the block who may uh you know knocking on Moscow office perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing proposed

um that is using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhaust a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started by Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it's ... to talk about the office after I listen to your show like\nThey didn't go hey I I'm enjoying the show the lighter though it and the idea of a question though in a moral issue as far as Mars once we get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America do like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\nOK still there yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a wicked alright well here's the thing I'm\nA there there isn't intelligent life on Mars now\nOkay there may be microbial lines and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end pay because uh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people who\nAre right and you can even make an argument that what we did\nTo the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong as we get these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we happier now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and\nI Would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there\nAre no Indians there are no\nBodies in hurts there are no redwoods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks nobody'd be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that\nCould happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars we get to that so\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do\nWell um I I think that's so little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nThat we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions uh being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because the mining claim even if you can't mind it today if if you think you're going to be able to minus Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the strange for\nThose claims of people could get a exploration missions finance mind the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable and um\nOnce our space a capabilities advanced a bit more that will become a possible thing to do\nGo to John in Seattle, Washington welcome to the program John go ahead\nFor taking my call You're welcome thank you ... your your guest's name Robert Robert Robert a request and the people who are um I'll probably take 'em up here [noise] they're sort of speculative\nThe first is um\nYou know anything about this earlier the guy that can lead to Learjet dug into the anti gravity back in the sixties and conversely\nYou know anything about possible a reversal of being able to generate artificial gravity and secondly you know anything about electrical ... ... from\nThe uh let me ... and those three questions but he's got one one more Robert got one more okay one more in the third one is a would that be advisable to design a space station like a ... type thing\nTo a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nOr at Robert lipstick that one first go ahead\nOh All right well let me just a run them down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one of the weird jets and anti gravity I don't know anything about that second question artificial gravity\nUm which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to creating artificial gravity you spend the space craft\nCreates a trickle force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to uh\nPrevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you get with um\nZero gravity along the least for longs for a long time so yeah exactly 'cause if you you know\nAnybody who just walks around on earth you know\nNot an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey think it's somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and\nAnd and and and and you know and moving around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that and so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and see our gravity we can but\nIf you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nRoy Moore will do anything for it\nRight and then the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount about electric caution um electric propulsion is using\n...

would select to go on a say a a hiking expedition in ...\nI'm a or an exploration\nUh adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with a guy in a sense

might be in September in Los Angeles I'm it it could probably going to be one of the major universities in Los Angeles um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or ... or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth okay you know we're going to have that one al\nI'm you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know there's a marsh probe on its way it's going to land in November ... insight and it's going to find out how that geologically active Mars is so that's kind\nOf land this November and we'll probably have um a discoveries from um ...\nThere's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them if you will pop discover thousands done I'm\nA pass 'em you know a well you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and talking about uh uh all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's\nA probably have ... people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get a little arch in people there too so we can hear from them\nCoping with the psychological injury like a staff of the most father or something like right now you know I'm a ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death\nThere's all these emotions happening I'm so out of the body sort of ... ... ... the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of killed as a psychological\nWound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional me\nYou know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories of personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere\nUm you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place you know and and I think these things in\nThe research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death and um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge yeah yeah yeah as perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the disease shortly after deaths are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps apple the Russians could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle psychological well being of the survivor a final goodbye from the disease\nI couldn't help let's move on through crisis or grief or maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and I and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease\nOr accepting of the loved one step after these operations and I think on TV usually ghost or negative

earlier\nSo we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of celebrity or a sigh phenomenon and operation so as a man was experiencing a ten emotional chefs related to the process of dying in a in a way it's set up\nHello Patrick distress message to that ex wife who we felt linked with in this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is\nSince his death we we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is a um a ghost or telepathy or ... Saddam and on my suspicion is\nYou know as a person is dying and these crisis events there are kind of a in a life threatening situation\n... ... they send something out into the environment like a message hello Patrick lead you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case or the wife\nOf you know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well but this is a great example of a crisis aberrations I phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment because obviously we don't know exactly when they got away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this as well\nOh yeah yeah it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal or ... or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be a you know the most prevalent things but\nThe the idea is I mean listen we're ... we all think electricity comes from posters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well an\nAnimal sure does snow you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nI've heard of people who walked by street lights and the lights go out and then as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own a bag of electricity and it's just like a sensitivity to environment it's all different more for everyone is walking around in a way [noise] um\nSo it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a poultry guys are an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for him is always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always present as well\nSince the first go counter ever um you know ... and that's an important thing to think about it you know we're always immersed in the electromagnetic field so we can avoid them\nOr you know this was part of the earth that's what it is a mess of always been laying there is some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating M. F. can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a goes they encounter in on the other side of that\n... there's this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with ... with goes and goes encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a year after year and that's an important part of the for them indicating that goes is president\nYou know for their for him after moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that that goes\nA whereas if you have a fluctuating he and my next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher right now so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nAre very cool very entangled with ghostly encountered even when I hear these real life and goes to encounter some people will say you know I just felt like you know my hair was standing up or I felt was the roof fell energized are like ... there was they felt like a\n... electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nI go to Jason in St ...

don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us and the way I'm a ... you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to be you know call out for that goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environment the resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling does come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it and\nWe've got teeth in Rochester New York City kids going to\nSay yes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent why people see go like others I've seen the film of the\nBaby ... ships being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother still wouldn't return to the wild the chicks noted key in on a mother conned or are you mentioned the window or who was searching for the pumpkin and news\nThat again bringing up imprinting I Would not think with a have a occurred with envy or different figures in all different kinds of apps and some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that that those are not not ghost by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing uh what about imprint teens that lake with a widower a scene his wife saying look in a in a in the back of the garage can't imprint teens\nCan people be so emotionally attached to mentally like a husband to his wife that\nHe would see his wife where's the rest of us would not and maybe\nI in my life would seen things that the rest of you would\nNot Mm Mm yeah oh yeah it's a\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it for a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why you're seeing his wife he's not seeing Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our that our cars\nAre there's radio signals all around them but if I turn my radio station in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequency so with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing a\nThere is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious so were all born with these archetype and the sort of\nBlueprint for how to really manage life um so we're sort of imprinted um with with uh\nWith these archetypes in with a sort of ... and ... beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of\nA vision and stories and things like that but I think we're all imprinted in a grand gesture but they couldn't be more specific for cultures could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nThey do fine fine to reach George ... use guy named George nine seven three one two three

George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currencies inside their IRA well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option to own both in their IRA now explain that well when I first heard about it pointed traded for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy bought two pizzas\nWith ten thousand bitcoins that were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and what stories like that more people are interested in owning a while that's\nQuite pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is bitcoin or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own and\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about\nGeorge we knew all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin if our listeners want to learn more

and we're going to go back to Sally and just a moment here Sally in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash\nOr but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations are currently\n\nShe's ... she's not there anymore okay well I'll get your reaction to that Brendan what do you think's going on\n... ... well that that's actually becoming more and more common hum and I've heard more and more stories about the the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know if somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phone hacked\nEmails the types of things um you know typically people will report they'll get hang up I'm a I'm a family member number who's been disease or whether it's a five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them and you know after their death or you know these types of things\nAnd there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair of psychologist Dr ... Cooper wrote called telephone calls from the dead which he encompasses a great ...\nOr less the bunch of these um a phenomenon that are happening and then there's the fat the meta message as well just recently came out as well which goes over this as well it's hard to really know the the main I mean listen to the idea that I'm\nA goat or consciousness or wherever you want to call it a ... electric off of electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure uh but any time we talked about this\nThere were signs anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events like she was talking about it um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistent Caesar similarities and they try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon ...\n...\nI think you could um put some ... some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening uh it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point go start a measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical ... their episodic they're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable or will which is essentially\nPrecipitate the a ghostly permission appearing\n... and I had a full reparation experience or after my brother passed away\nBy a string of showing greater than I was having writer's block on this or not related destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room um he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it it sits during the day\nOr at the foot on my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall\nUm can you maybe elaborate on what precipitated this\nOr how does your does your brother pass away or when he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away or the ... before you have the extra and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay\nAll right I'm while answer your second question then we'll get back to the first question and so I I think it's kind of similar to the well we talked about earlier you know with the husband saying his wife and then the wife kind of says hey check behind the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is happening in other words he's saying get on with a\nComplete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother at the end if and when you resonate with something it's not just\nInformation is the visual stuff as well um\nThere you talked about before as far as that unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night ... and had the\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but you could somehow\nI feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and had a reading each other's emotions and then you wake up and find the dog that type of thing so you know why there is a physical communication or word or some sort of like ...

that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what are the what are the bellwether state that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of them one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going to recently read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a ... there's a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that he was opposed to Kevin all wondering who oppose it which she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and\nIf she holds on it'll be because she's Claire McCaskill kind of an institution in Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one turns out in the balance we usually important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat and other democratic incumbent facing the Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights\nVery very uh a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden as hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott 'cause he's seen as a leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him as people think the rescue effort has had been sufficient so again Democrats need to hold on to that when if they're going to have a chance\nAnd third is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... Arizona is kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way uh in any election\nOr and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side and of course the cinema on the Democratic side in a year of the woman going at it uh well Martha McSally running pretty much as the Trump Republican\nAnchors the cinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if there were cuts are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total\nOne of those is probably going to have the Arizona so those seem like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November sex\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ... an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regard to Missouri in Florida the kind of the

to know is is um [noise]\nHe's going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in a certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA suburban voters or is it Hispanics or as a working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voted suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities those are two groups of voters who simply aren't as reliable or in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance at a presidential election so\nThey're you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict

board they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be the next you know this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now what he wants to deal with them when they returned back to the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them and that shouldn't have college done some ruin legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he seems to be in national threatened always going to say it doesn't have to defend his decision he just got to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons and they're blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my gas is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know but\nThe reality is I Know by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have there would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nWe remember in the near future and the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best for plans for the worst\nI think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up for their own political reasons for doing nothing they decided they expect Donald Trump took cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhen they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out the military what if we do in fact created a threat to human wall\nAnd block people from entering the United states\nNow and I'm actually going to have what what could be by them as much ten or Fifteen thousand people because of their of ants keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so what I'm saying is at this point\nWe we have a real decision to make and then as soon as this is what Lincoln as saying over and over again yeah uh you know if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union\nHe didn't say an apple he didn't say they try to limit and many of his key early speeches this nostalgic sadness to the\nUh the we're bound together by the common core of mystic memory you know we have no reason to fight each other on and he's almost pleading you know don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is\nPerfect crossroads to make the decisions are we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America for in the end\nAnd people laugh U.S forces to cave in guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop the\nWe got to take a break or I Want you to weigh in when we get back on what the next fourteen days are going to look like what you think Nate Silver is up production and much more a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is our guest eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number later on pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh we'll check in and much more\nListen for more than three years there is a software there's been a software vulnerability\nIn the Google Plus social media network unwittingly giving

eighty nine hundred twenty Bracken the jury Colorado Arkansas in Wyoming accepting than a brass got up an slam challenge again and talks condition said that the slanted designed to bring awareness to the next\nLast two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing leak claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the success to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choices election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decision\nWell I think that's right and um and I think that that is a sense of the whole question\nOf what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left the you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to total cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force or they openly say they're willing to use force it with a former attorney general saying when the Republicans go low kick them all you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to\nHarass people ah and drive them out of public life uh you know and remember the Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFor their banking and financial services committee if they get control of the house so significant and people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage and in a sense of\nHumor journal mushy of of the modern of American government which the left passionately believes uh I I think that you're right that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment is\nThese are historical events them into Kavanaugh fight\nWasn't just politics it was historic we're we're gonna get\nShowered considerably on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be smeared and parents who were assassinated and lied and manipulated and brown beaten into backing down so that was that was a historic moment do have an effect was forty or fifty years\nA similarly this caravan whether it's seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers right Minnesota to fourteen thousand\nIf this caravan can get into the United states how big is the next caravan and the shower then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time event or the entire world is watching to see whether or not we have the guts to protect the United states of America from an invasion\nOr and if we don't trust me that it will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly where they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as is offering to provide for them that's where I'd go\nWell and remember it was just me we we shouldn't have to have a showdown but there's there's no such thing as a sensuous thing\nTo be the ... state you have to decide the your state can in fact imposed on the federal government activities which you cannot possibly imposed and at some point we're going to have a big collusion with sanctuary cities and centuries stage ... or a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um I have a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that the way events and are you in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly the cabin okay you know it's amazing to watch how\nThe you know the the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night or the president\nActually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying they've never covered up single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores followed them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them they're not want to hear anywhere anymore\nOr what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen of Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and now which McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or or elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nNo I Know guys I well they do run on\nA government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine it collapses because this totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing to come to a big idea and it's a really bad idea\nI agree totally All right um we'll be checking in regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate but she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think that that doesn't change the race for the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registrations for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about her and the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get to our phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star at the at the\nTown hall I was in we had a wonderful time down in Texas I saw big

running for office which by the way it may not be a bad idea at some point that you run\nAway or not or if they're probably knocked me out the thoughts but it's funny you say that not that the janitors guy in a salad and yeah\nI saw you signing autographs and I said I I think time signing autographs and then we brought Linda on the stage and she's I Lyndon say\nNew York I I think New York

and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family it's five hundred

Christian thing look at you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interaction\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't communicate our ideas as passionately\nAnd as intensely as well now now that just means we don't have to get his dirty and say did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served do so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his wife\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success fourteenth state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever\nI I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThey're not stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display we know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America look for a better job they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regardless but others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they put it on steroids and emulate it so that you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating if\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump houses the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people who did I picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better thank God\nHe's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button and there are a lot of nicotine ms and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty two percent believe me his messages recurring tell him as a message to live within the black community\nI come from a traditional democratic family years voted party of a black it in my family and\nOur sphere are now so ... to ... they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good well what we're doing with the conservative movement or they're going to vote\nWith us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly breaking President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today\nCNN ... blocks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics from CNN and MSNBC just starting to see we got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey\nWhat's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help\nOn this particular side he's going to\nGet on the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus or something okay and I think all of us here do\nWe believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this or we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense were\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to create an environment where that\nThat have that natural talent flourishes the the word or\nEducation from the Latin is didn't do good eye to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight of water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far [noise]\nYeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he needs to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul ... wells from that but I think the leftist\nAuthoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political ... and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and its identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a run up against a racist

recognition for his resolute stand against Washington's wasteful spending and the citizens against government waste named him a taxpayer superhero thank God I Love the president's plan that he

I went by twenty points districts you got a tight race\nSo maybe one day we pray for that Sean but right now we're in a fight or for our country fight for this district um again thanks thanks for having me on appreciate the shout out last week on TV as well ready to be with you\nWell great to be with you look I now identified the fifty races that I think will be the tipping point\nWhere the balance of power in the house and if people don't want to turn on the TV two weeks from tonight and hear the word speaker elect below sea well you're somebody that needs to win this is one of the top fifty races following\nThat literally where the where the balance of power is going to be made in terms of who's going to control the house look I think we're going to do well in the Senate but you know off year elections are historically what they are and they're tough but I Do think that you have a great chance of holding on to this seat because you've served the people in North Carolina well\nSo this is a blue moon electric brush here in North Carolina there is no governor no us that are on the ticket I'm at the top of the tickets so you know well that makes mom really proud of the same time uh it's I'm at the top of the ticket and so we got to make sure that people come out at the ...\nUh Shaun this is a turnout turnout turnout election people just have to get out and go vote a we've got all the way through November third and then back again on November ...\nPlenty of early voting um you know we've got a lot of good things on the ballot in North Carolina this year I'm I'm very excited I think we're going to win this but we've just got to do the work we've got to have people turn out like the president knows how important that says he's been into the district\nUm he's coming back again to the state uh here friday night as a sport my hope to be colleague mark hairs\nOn your on your Charlotte but um yeah we got a lot of tough races this year there's been a lot of articles written about North Carolina Thirteen\nBut you know like you said I'm not as as a clear contrast race I'm a conservative member of the Freedom Caucus I'm In a tough district I'm a small business entered my opponent\nShe's one of the largest Nancy Pelosi donors uh she's against the tax cuts and JOBS Act he's getting a lot of outside money from ... she's pack Tom ... the peach drunk guy a from a bomb a superPAC and that's kind of all that money is flooding in right here to the middle of North Carolina so it's a tough fight one that we can win but it's definitely a clear contrast you know both\nThe cook Political Report an odds maker Nate Silver and tightened their assessment of this race\nOr and the cook report actually lifted the north Carolina where you could explain the exact areas that are going to be impacted by by this um this district anyway is among the five congressional districts across the country\nThat it said had shifted more towards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls closed what seven thirty if I remember correctly on election I\nUh they do and so we're going to fight all the way through the end ah look this is a district that goes from Greensboro\nDown to ... over to ... uh this is a this is a great a district but it is one of the topics toughest district and the state it is if you look at those numbers it's an are six or so it is a real fight we knew this twenty two months ago when I was sworn in\nThat this would be a a a fight for the foundation for who gets the speaker's gavel and twenty Eighteen and voted to come through now it seems like people are waking up voters are starting to turn out and we're thankful for every single one of these conservative voters that are going to the polls of the few days of early voting but\nAgain this is a contrast race\nYou know for low unemployment or it's like we've got a growing the economy would of done when I said I was going to do\nWell you also have the ninth district in in a tight race\nThe mark Harris is on on deck and Trump or the president has come against the port me and mark Harris both uh this coming friday night and so looking forward to mark here as a winning be starting with him he's a great guy I've known him for over two decades or so look forward to him winning and serving right alongside of\nWell this is an important race if you're in the thirteenth congressional district in you're in North Carolina including what much of high point or Greensboro all up David and David
