I Wish I had the brain that I have now when I was Twenty one who would have been I Would have been a whole different story but let me ask you let let's let's start off a pretty directly\nUm you're a dermatologist yeah and how how did you get into\nWhere you are today working with you know guys like Robert shock and Robert ... ball and now you're one of the leading Egypt ... type researchers in the world right now you've\nYou've really done well for yourself but what got you hear\n... this is a you know this is one of those things you look back and it's just incredible sometimes you just\nYou know you you you take a moment and you you asked yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching\nThe History Channel Discovery Channel and you do off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... in in focus\nAnd then uh years ago I um I think somebody gave me the vine mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and I it's just that that just kind of opens up the up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had some you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and life and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert ... a few months later and all you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add to coast to coast damn scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the rope\nA new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the speaks and ... at least in that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulb started going off that got you involved in all of the\nYeah well you know this is a this goes back to old Ryan mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I talked to myself if if an architect a bill\nThat three pyramid a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt starts with a wry and they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it your pauses believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three with him you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of you and they were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceded that way and\nAnd so why don't I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I notice it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the or the book to that stage of have co authored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dream Steeler\nWhich is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the father of the things and there was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it\nThat there is no reference to it um as far as we know before the parents were built if there was a ... then it ... it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the lioness on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page\nRobert sawed and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um\nI think it was called the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to

start to move forward and end the dream stolen\nA top most the fourth says mentions and in illustrates to ... there and desert boxing just tweeted\n... ... ... ... is there a second things well there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second things\nOr if a great question I'm Out of it so that was first that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting ... seconds things are as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed Spain's\nA and double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA as some of the you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um are you know they're on unmistakable so to the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAs an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground and it was used to build a mosque\nSo they're they're apparently was a physical things\nAre on the other side of the Nile but there are things buried under the sounds\nA let's say west of a conference here but it's possible to see\n... ... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nHave said that he repaired that speaks but built the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten out of the great pyramid and why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned is yet of course Egypt ... just mostly just causes do not accept the inventories you are as a historical documents\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we culture this argument so we're actually seeing as it is\nAuthentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nThe ah you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text and\nOn in that text or the it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad day\nOr so the ... the combination is that that will have\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John ... ball and the paper it's on I think it's on a rubber revolves\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother about two and then he sees in the back of the book where he explains the theory so there are some people that think the pyramid was not coming to a peak\nAnd of course other people say it was a and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the sticker layers\nUm\nIs it every ten steps is that every twelve is there some kind of ... uh\nNo I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nBecause you know you were you could just you know simple in mind that I thought each step all they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in the Egyptian Egyptians designed to appear ... with uh something called they called ... which is the purely dangle\nA and it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how the conceptual lies a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course\nIt should be the same amount like you're going out the staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know it just gets thicker and to your question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course\nNow I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with bases inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen debtors decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in the state to block interview I I think I said that\nUh the ... or ... um shot a sharp tooth and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during the twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade into big tipper it was a star Iraq so it was starting\nTo disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation ... saw import to chip shows\nThat the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and we lie the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI got a

crane the\nCBC Radio to e as our very best am and FM radio but the two you can hear your favorite station better\nWe found the most difficult part in building a radio is perfecting reception ... brings stations and clear and can knock out interference from other sources\nThat was a game changing over you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peak you know the total number of peaks was twenty three\nSome of these people are worse the civically noted by peach tree to have surfaced a ratios that were around for a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty two\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round the fracture tend to run\nA overt feeling in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have it seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this\n... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenties or you know courses that have a surface area that are around a number of fraction of what he said\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of brown fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I think at least they have not had\nNow we're going to get to that ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yet you need to have if you are going to a proposed these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these rose is starting with the descending passage way\nThe way up to the top of the king's chamber\nWhy so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... that does which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth of Nineteen twenty fifth that the alliance with the uh the uh you know the big Chevron\nThat uh that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right now that cost on the Twenty one is wide under the V. slate as in other words if a soldier where the feeling than the than the one that we just talked about it a course number thirty four also has a round\nFractional forty fifth ... scene in this day and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber then the other courses don't you don't have ... the twenty fifth and they're not associated with dealing so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have an eighth a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground and power\nUm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those run line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which are marked in your um that was followed last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just the granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's four wheel\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are but it's not the politicking chamber and that also happens to be a ... a ... ... you know within the resolution of this and that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big\nBoys I got it yeah yeah of course we don't know exactly what we did this kind of I have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into the illustrations just to give a rough guy\nWant to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is\nA pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and it's just as a ... minute see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion and the use of the lion at go back like taffy\nAnd everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay by the they used the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things and Leo Rising\nRight all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley happy not an accident you\nKnow with its references of course uh with lions too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with all forty yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nAnd let's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that and the second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nI go back gray tabby\nYou like that do you like that the area okay on\nA day or I always love here use that all of that year man roared do you place great for me to keep it up and down\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute\nI got two questions and then I've got a great little your ring quick joke\nAbout dermatologist at the end\nOf the first question they asked who is credited with Jimmy ...\nOr ... or the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics\nAnd then the second question is are all the Howard graphics brown go back and Egypt in that area of the world the same hieroglyphics that are found and the pyramids of Mexico or central and south la\n... is the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff here were lipic inscriptions in Beckley deputy is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking is are the hieroglyphics that are written all the ... and Egypt on a pair of mayors of off and go backwards that they are the same Ira Glass fix that are found on the pyramids in Mexico and central and South America\nOr okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different higher there are different ... and it's interesting you asking this question because you are or\nAre you are basically uh giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak your thing that the euro lipic inscriptions and go back you Debbie in other words you're implying there is a there's there's writing they are and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be on to something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after mining but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at go back like taffy but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H M the bells that looks very similar to the age blocks in ... are are they related I don't know\nThere are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby\nAre they are they representing the zodiac a that a word in the end era and throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world\nAfter that are they the same I don't know but uh go back lead happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first than it is the oldest is it the same language\nThat no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic tree like the I call it the army's age I'm the bells whether it looks like but did that age that ages repeatedly\nThere is a very exciting possibility um regarding that question that very often go back to Debbie I'm ... and it's regarding the symbol that you mentioned Jimmy ... there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I ... I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\n... will do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared\nJimmy shirt [noise] earlier this week I interviewed a brat plows and uh the the artist for Pearl Jam\nAnd his knowledge of Egypt and art and sculpture and how he incorporate that into his artwork\nAnd what that caused me to do I I just love to research or all things Egypt right and so as I was preparing for the show tonight\nI just went through a Pearl Jam I could not stop for the last three days and I just had to get a that song and it's just absolutely amazing also over on the coast to coast am website there's a video that\nYou have to check out of the Boston Dynamics atlas robot doing park core\n... is one of the most disturbing videos you are ever going to watch\nThe apple its programming upgrade has enabled it to do park core fight for real that I ...

Kim\nChi says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinate to happen happen yes\nUm I haven't watched I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and gets like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the ... the great pyramid\nHas revealed to so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are\nBeyond coincidence and\nThat they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine an author Alex Green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the father Shakespeare sonnet or to the coordinates\nOr not to heaven but uh of course Allen\nMy say it is Evan Wright uh adds\nTo the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically a the ... the court has said Allen just discovered a fall right next to the ... which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month and is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonics with Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what these reveal\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month okay so now that the top half of the pyramid\nA song hee a wash my Bergen ... many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and I guess apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or ... or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring or Arab Spring uprising or he resigned or what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nA great question Daniel my new what's it like there now with ...\nRegarding doctor have lots of first of all I had ... ... email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous in as as the questions and so I've had good experiences where they might never met in person than you probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permanent um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed\nMessages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the ah they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try and then what they do\nWell do you see that the the new one research would be ongoing like it is it does not have while she was still the director there\n...

have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thank you for the phone call for a minute the origins of the word Barrow\nAnd its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't write some thanks for sure but I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so ...\nSo he chipped colleges are saying that they are in the old kingdom I determine was not use\nSo the term pharaoh is technically speaking doesn't apply to the king of the old king them I think the first ah and I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new king the when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared and that's\nAll I Know about it offhand I should have read about this\nBefore but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two points that need to be brought out here are when we're when we're going back to\nUm meant as a um and in the\nFirst and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings a\nBright light in armor and minutes ah the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same ... minutes unarm are may be the same or they could be two different scenes they weren't\nCalled Barrows back then and now there's another ah and\nI have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egypt ... and that the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nAre ... um yeah I Can't really comment on it 'cause I don't know enough about it um I I have regarding what the king was cause I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasties the king had five different titles\nUm and then the very beginning um you know the ... forest teams so there was forest armor\nAnd the horse or a ... or so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after uh can you know the designation a next to embed which is basically referring to operate or Egypt\nAnd then came the lady's name a you know and then tend to cartridge name later [laughter] um but uh the as you just set yourself so feral came later I I just looked it up it sounds like twelve hundred the he's the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies let's go to Jay out here in Los Angeles and Jay you're up next on coast\nSay hello hello J. lo J. how you guys doing hello how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um Egypt and the effect on mom's side\nAnd I'm growing up as a kid I Would always hear my grandmother's elites they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here or there there's always secrets to the um\nThe great pyramid has secrets to this to tunnels here you know they're you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say the woman always stuck with me that I really wanted to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nTry to take it with a grain of salt um I really am glad that you're on the show a number I really wanted to ask you for your um uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is is there an opening\nOr any access behind the scenes here on top of the head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the hall back\nSomewhere like that that has an access to an insight chamber of this of the things that um hold a something very dear to humanity that we are uh\nWe are not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWell Jay you're in luck because men who's been researching some ... paper about it so I'm going to it now my new before we get to what's underneath\nThe the ... on the left front to love from Paul uh there\nHas been photographs of the top of the banks fried and the crown of what appears to be a hats your whole life and I have also read a lot of research about\nThe right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year you must talk about the head of this being spurs and possible entrances\nYes so there is that there is a space\nOr in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch and I'm I'm I think Roberts uh football was telling me about this I think uh you can ... can stand in there maybe six foot deep\nAnd um but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is basically a blind pouch but\nUm but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that I can tell you that the uh you know the most crucial um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth\nCharted under this being a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial and he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical ...\nUm there is a a death another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nInto this things they're looking for chambers and then you know the one that Jimmy just mention of course we know from a scientific analysis that they'll get to our space is under the beans\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert truck\nAh was studying uh years ago I'm a has a regular ... ah has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something in it that self interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back a with another research expedition to hopefully drill right\n... yeah first well what we\nWhat we would like to do first as to map this again with a little bit more advanced uh by small graffiti\nAnd maybe electric conductivity studies entered really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know what you ... if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven and ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw us space about two meters\nA deep and uh and then then Roberts uh you know did his studies are a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that the states as five meters deep so you have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have lots of marketing or drilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were\nToo far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them and of course they had other reasons why they were drilling the what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non invasive buddy and really finding out the space and when we have a good idea where it is then with permission of course there are more try a small probe\nInto that space and see what the\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about there's this this this rumor has been going around yeah we're quite a while it would just be great to finally uh put this to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber and so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to\nHave a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nOr whatever might be inside a you know so this isn't enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things that are going to have all you have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the ... came in on Twitter this was from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that at this thinks may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nAnd then on Wednesday we expect that cloud cover to leave the region completely leaving us with lots of sunshine and warmer at sixty two\nAnd warmer Thursday with a higher sixty five as we continue to expect

think in the hole in the if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early Israel lights um when they were in Egypt of I think\nIt's a ... for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in in us in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a ... a ... in the pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know just a virus community disappears and this is like a logical evidence at

planet of the apes the original one with ...\nOf you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth and then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has a media and\nThat you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie um and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nBut ah let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible night here with a with the audience and they they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are right and let's go wild cards could've Dorothy in Carmichael, California Dorothy you're up next on goes\nOh hi how I'm OK several ... created the that as he gets ... ... back in the ... thing tonight was responsible for all the way our credit has had in my room and like\n... ... ... for his eleventh while I'm\nEternal team Bernie Mac and other wearing a hoodie is hot and gifts and not in mind and couldn't whew I'm\nOK cue things that need to think it would be like a big win in it and then maybe you could recreate\nPart of the small model to see if there was like a a portal open\nThey would hit and hit the kids or you know town\nAnd meeting had something like ... ... they had in mind but she bill ... says I Can't wait to get in there you know is that right around ... had kind of thing talented in mind\nOh you're talking about the Winchester House here in California\nYeah remember how she Sarah Palin has kept built on all those extra rounds 'cause they go get confused when it bother her and you know she she kinda lost that they're at the end but she had in mind went nowhere\nYeah and the spiritual get\nLost and they would get lost and they now I Know that\nAnd you get these ... men and maybe they ... you know they want it to the royal because they would do that and that has a rat\nAnd maybe that's a great they render centers that oh ... ... ... let's say for a long time so I'm really getting out that maybe\nThe ... the Dorothy I'm going to jump in and and and say that you are on does something my new and I have talked about this and the\n... the locks in the rooms inside of the great pyramid our acoustic lead tuned man they resonate at a bowl many frequencies but one of the main ones is a four forty which resonates through out the great pyramid doesn't it Manu\nThan clown right and I was a so they'll have a couple of comments about your question Dorothy so first of all Christopher done or when he was talking with Jimmy a few days ago um I think uh if you ask Christopher done if a if his model his theory\nMake has room for the you know extra spaces and the purely key may say yes\nI'm a so I could do it because of these residents says that you know electromagnetic energy focusing and all those things so that's the first part of your ah one ounce or the other answer about ... you were talking about the spirits of the kings so I you know you sort of the same vein I I think\nThe first of all the Egyptians did make rooms\nFor spirits of the king and for a little bit to receive offerings basically so we know that ... had a small room in front of his pyramid where a statue of him was placed\nAnd uh it was basically looking out to the little uh you know the cold\nUm and uh he I mean what do you ask about him you know so him you know uh his must stop I actually had as a room a small room and the statue of him was placed in a room and then it was wild up and what was that for it was for spirit\nTo receive offerings of from you know his family and so I think you are I think you're absolutely right and in fact what you're asking is very much in line with what the ... I Believe\nThat uh uh you know that are just the spirits were very much there there were very much present and they just had to be housed inside of either a mommy or a statue and then it became alive and uh and it was still interacting with a family members of the friends\nGreat call tonight let's go to the Rockies to Gary in Portland, Oregon Garrett welcome to go\nHey I as a matter of great to have you on board on that I have a question about the snake yes\nAll right so I about a year ago their videos that you're starting to surface\nNeal last rear of the things he's writing down at that horrible the well wouldn't really call ... ... on walks\nA yeah there's a there's an opening yes um I take it that within the past year the Egyptian authorities have a renewal of about a half dozen off and are\nBacked by the tail more by the tail end yeah yeah\nYeah it wasn't an organized or the south side\nThe ladder get over it or if you have any comments like we're looking for hidden chambers obviously we've already downloaded them right now when we get to know what's inside\nNow you're talking about the south side of the rear of the things\nThe ... I see the south side yes um there is a robber so Robert scan did show on both sides\nIf I remember correctly a there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes I'm ... and uh\nI mean I have no ... I don't know you know what if when you're when you're a decrease goes and investigate those things that they're all published a data and you know there's\nThere was something that goes further back you know um and so yeah I Am with you I think ah I think there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published and\nJay widen or ... ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around and he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looked down on the ground and he sees what he thinks is a piece of wood covered with dirty\nYeah so he he leads over grabs would picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down and adds she was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there\nYeah and he said Jimmy I'm here to tell you I'd no matter what I personally lifted up a piece of wood and look into a tunnel underneath the south side\nOf the rear flanked by the tail of the things and he shot himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about uh the veracity I think that there is there's there are spaces onto this thing the main question is does it go anywhere it was just a blind LBJ that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now she is is that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean it is nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it but he did find\nA tunnel of that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was gone and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long that stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then he high walk to add denied that there were any tunnels there later\nGo to ... am with your guest host Jimmy

of course Twitter too as well an amazing amazing this is right yeah it's just it's it's such an important time for research and what is going on I think that the great pyramid is finally starting to give up\nSome of its mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones we've got one last segment here let's go east of the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nThe morning I knew for Father's Day mourning mourning James\nOr good morning Larry Ann how are you in the er hurricane were you okay\nUh where I'm located in God's name but I'm I'm located on the east coast\nYeah but it it it was a such a wide big storm that it it it affected everything up north there\nAre so far as the people who have lost everything\nYeah yeah so you guys were okay over on that side\nWere good on

produces under pressure five electricity and you may know all of us are right hand and maybe would have done that\nWe don't know I've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course Edgar Casey\n... ... ... the tell your current earth currents denial is rerouted it did around uh adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose was to generate a electricity\nOr a ... I'm Sorry I was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so um\nI you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lost civilizations starting something in these uh and then the old kingdom\nAre Egyptians or a you know building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro was your name right yes so um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk\nThat's not a huge stone that is actually the original hills that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for those to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has in his senior rated this that\nThe things that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and there were a line to you know the belt stars of Orion a dating to step peppy and then you know in the old kingdom a Egyptians came they basically build their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so I end the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks\nMuch older and when you walk into the red pyramid uh you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a new phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight Iran coast yeah I loved it thank you so much Jimmy\nTwenty five to thirty five percent of their overall customer accounts\nAttempt to return to normalcy and Florida after hurricane Michael state offices reopen today so does Florida State university at FEMA chief ...\nSays go a long way to go the hardest mission is going to be I'm not quite the same and getting thousands of people out of shelter in more suitable living conditions\nAre but ultimately there's going to be a long term housing mission\nThe official death toll from the hurricane stands at Nineteen that's expected to climb as crews sift through massive amounts of debris President Trump and the first lady will tour hard hit parts of Florida and Georgia today the president is defending the way he spoke about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's accuser\nHow did you get home I don't remember on sixty minutes allegedly stolen last the precedent why he mimicked Christine Blasey Ford in his speech in Mississippi had I not made that speech we would not have won he said Democrats treated Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh terribly well blog before was treated with great respect\nYou and thank you treated her with great show ya I did it just seemed to be saying that she lied about ... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter what we won\nSteven pork noise CBS News Washington\nThe president also told sixty minutes he'll stick to a U.S arms deal with Saudi Arabia\nUnless she sees concrete evidence crown prince Mohammed bin ... government was behind the disappearance\nAnd suspected murder of journalists Jamal karaoke CBS as we jak\nSaudi officials have called the allegations baseless and then a new statement said the kingdom also affirmed that if it received any action it will respond with greater action\nSpare we'll have an air Kensington Palace announced\nThis morning the new ...

know I I was thinking what if he said no I've seen the hurricane situations I changed my mind really in climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nWhat an early age I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about that really I mean they say that we had her a change that was far worse and\nFinally just said was Michael sense that they say they don't even want to find the science and some say it's worse than having a you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda like camp inches also as a political agenda\nWhere was it Angola the deep altered climate change data it's science was as the Al Gore and others would tell you if it was so surely perfect there's no disagreement than the scientific humidity it's just not sure why would they have to alter the data back\nAt that time otherwise job of started listening and he heard that he's about to lose his mind uh I I why do I know and the president was down visiting the devastation led by Michael Moore hurricane you call that a thousand percent right I think up to now we've lost Nineteen people is the latest number I heard but\nYou know thankfully most people listen and got out\nA job of stories with weather bell dot com that that annoy you I Know right\nOut of all of our way way way interviews the ... she went to debate the president she didn't want to interview the president she wanted a debate\nFirst of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had\nNear record snow fall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold\nPeriods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties and nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process so the past two years if you look at the charge you can see Greenland has had well above normal snow fall and near record snow fall so Greenland she apparently she's not aware of this\nBecause two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking high about five six years ago then they came down below in their back near normal now let me let me say this\nAnd the president answered the question perfectly here's why up until\nNow climate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her why she is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally I feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just blindly accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now or\nYou know whether anybody else better than anyone else I mean I again when you look back at the earth temperature as a garden cooler than warmer in the warmer and then cooler\nIt has self questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me give Leslie for\nIf if she's listening if you're let's say we'll give you for example the kinds of by more rapidly than Michael right off the top of my head Nineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine\nCame eleven days across the Atlantic it's a tropical wave\nForty eight hours later a category five hurricane fill your with a hundred and eighty mile an hour wind gusts Corpus Christi went from a hurricane or a category one to a category four in the twenty four hours coming into Corpus Christi Nike Seventy\nAnd good out in Nineteen sixty nine went over to Nantucket light trip with a hundred and twenty five mile an hour winds\nThirty six hours people were fifty mile an hour tropical storm and that's way up in the north Atlantic there are countless examples of rapid feedback development there was a textbook case for it and it's amazing watching this go on in front of my eyes\nOf people say how did this happen hotter and it's right out of my classes at Penn State Nineteen Seventy eight in the Nineteen seventies\nOr member magazine had the coming ice age back on the cover and the seventies\nSo there is an echo that all the the climate to sue the earth temperature but you know if you want to look at you know missions or\nA manmade factors what the president is also saying as competitively it's we are not the biggest polluter on the planet far from it at any point in countries like China could\nAnd we're cleaning it up quicker than anybody ever looked at who is leading a world in reducing CEO to the United states mission\nI'd I I miss because we we were profitable and we're putting it back into it but the fact is it some of these questions were based on things that are almost the opposite or apparently she missed all was on\nA when you got to remember for many for many for some some I guess you know just want to believe what they want to believe but there's also ulterior motives and political\nMotives and and so it's about capitalism it's about you know the concept that you know man is destroying it's an environment and pillaging at all for profit and we've heard these arguments over the years many many times right but I got to go I got a lot of other ... started I\nThink about whether bell dot com as want to say let me play a little bit of of some of the rioting that took place this weekend and I don't really care\nTo listen if you're in ... left if you're you know part of some far out right wing radical group you know what everybody needs to just knock it off because somebody's going to get killed here\nAnd I'm Serious as it is if you find yourself your family in any of these situations season you might buy to get out of the way because there are a lot of dangerous people out there and the fact that we didn't have\nPolice come in faster in Portland I think it was a huge mistake we saw the assault on these drivers that was by antifa what a week ago and these congressmen and women they need to calm the waters on every side and tell

means that you heard Michael fuss and Mr liar\nSimpson or all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in United Kingdom which we the Congress heaven and court issued a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or\nAm I that that you see a kid\nWho conduct electronic surveillance of American cities citizen on foreign soil without

back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they

need this meeting happens directly after Mr call me as relieved of his duties but just before I'm Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discovered\nIt

V. I. L. GB CQ it's\nLaw enforcement it's veterans are the candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those were told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nI guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp selling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in the gubernatorial election\nEither way I told you last week about Chris than a cinema and she's going up against Martha ... Sally one of the important races that were following\nAnd how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and the Washington Examiner apparently found the emails that shows cinema herself inviting a prominent group\nI'm not making this up of him reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is in Arizona called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day and the protest the war\nIn a march in two thousand and three I guess that would be the same war that her opponent Martha ... Sally was risking her life and fighting for\nAnyway the cinema campaign would not say why she invited the which which is er clarify why she thought members of the coal deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning war and peace the which is in question it should be noted claimed to practice only non violent magic\nCinema encouraged the which is to wear colorful clothing come ready to dance toil in stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nI uh I don't even know what to say\nAnyway the people Arizona you're paying attention or we have a breaking hate that

governor the governor of the state of\nTennessee and now he's running for the open Senate seat of Bob Corker Corker but thank goodness Marsha Blackburn is now pulled out of fourteen point lead in the latest polls you was down for a little while\nA lot of people were concerned about it but I think now that they see that reticence staff is basically saying he's saying one thing to the people at Tennessee I'm planning to do something very differently\nAnd where do you see the tape that we have tonight as it relates to Claire McCaskill another important red state Democrats Senate race that's going on member you vote for Claire McCaskill you might as well ... ... vote for any democratic congressman you might as well vote for ... if you stay home because you don't\nFeel like voting and you're being lazy well that's a half a vote for ...\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatches secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the second now\nThe allegation has banned the Saudi ... from friends ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi hitting team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been heroes some reports claiming that cause show these murder was reported but to date no audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues they in an absolute saying it absolutely short because show he was killed by anyone that can't say it let alone the Saudis and others just began to break moments ago\nYeah she continues to focus on battleground states ahead of next month's midterm elections\nAnd it's just three weeks until the mid term elections and one of the key contests to watch is the U.S Senate race right here in Missouri between incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill and the Republican challenger the state attorney general Josh Hawley I sat down with both candidates\nMcCaskill says what is hurting Washington right now is the extremes of both parties and the last thing Washington needs is a rabbit partisan\nAll under noise it's generated on the end of the spectrum we need more noise in the middle we need more people rewarding moderate to are willing to look beyond party and actually come together\nMcCaskill is running as a moderate she votes with President Trump just under half the time Republican holy says McCaskill doesn't vote with the president on anything that matters\nShe brought her to get to middle class tax cuts uh she's voted against a rolling back regulations are seeing

hearing the Republican side and my point do you is this look I I think it's very hard to try I I don't I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the ... Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now hunger is ...\nGet to walk the halls without what now becoming I think a dangerous confrontations on other\nProtests on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting during the by the way all within the last few weeks back to\nDoing it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the thing with my fear is this rhetoric is now crossed the line\nIf you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government you know you know one thing I and I pull the table and play it for you right now\nI always said about the Obama the number one leave kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did\nAnd I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents\nAnd I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop up and if you like to hear\nA ... I don't need to but what I Would love to play it again well first of all you're ignoring the wishes of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you get your samples of Donald Trump really\nWhen he stood up and saying well I got to hurt him if you do I'll send you in court don't worry about it and you talk marching orders for violent okay I remember\nOne nothing is another one I saw sort of like well people are saying oh no no no no no I mean if you want me the question I didn't take that as the same intensity and messages arm hearing regularly but this is an every day the ...\nThat is now happening with the Democratic party and by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama only\nPlay I mean what are you talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error you got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect\nAnd anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile or\nMr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House ... not only did he get in the door ...\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and test the stairs that would have gone right up to the residents of the Obamas ... that is extraordinarily chilling to me well yeah\nYou're welcome ... valley called ... ...\n... less than ... here's what I think we agree on violence is that I Hope we both agree that the thing I Will and I have actually and written about it or you know Hillary Clinton's comments Eric Holder's using ... spoken out about them and again\nThere is also a very very visible pattern Cohn at ... at ... at a Donald Trump I'll beat the crap out of new part of the problem is nobody wants to hurt you wanted anymore and

I mean we spend a lot of time going over all of the allegations and in the case or professor Ford\nOr Mrs Ramirez or miss sweat dig that cetera I mean in every particular case and um I Would just lay out to your daughter and then go over you know what the allegations were how they came out where's any corroboration than any of the cases I mean I thought the most outrageous one was the final one to get\nBy miss sweating egg you was claiming and her story shifted in changed dramatically within the course of a week from my perspective and I think\nShe was basically claiming almost on a weekend basis that these kids were drugging these young girls teenage girls and boys will wind up in the halls and they were waiting their turn to gang rape the girls\nNow I'd ... hard pressed\nYou know again that the media looked high and low why didn't far to find any corroboration and they weren't able to the case of Mr Ford the one I witnessed she placed in the room so that didn't happen or even her best friend says she doesn't remember any parties that she was out with judge Kavanaugh so you do need some type\nCorroboration if you believe in due process some presumption of innocence and I think we I think the Republicans handled it\nWith the sensitivity of deserves with the severity of deserves considering the severity of the allegation\nBut I'm not a person that Russia is a judgment about you have to I Believe that it served this country well to follow the rule of law and due process and a presumption of innocence and I think that happened in this case and I think the person that laid out the best case and that was what Susan Collins\nAnyway thank you Robert good luck with that um let me play you know twenty two days I just want to remind you we now know I was telling your earlier
