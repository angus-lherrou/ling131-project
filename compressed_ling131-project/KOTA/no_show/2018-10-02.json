that will uh you know permanently keep our prices high and also raise prices for pharmaceuticals in Canada and maybe Mexico\nYep that's one of the things we have long opposed and it's really

cancer\nAnd the the\nBottom line is provisions like that which could lock in the U.S from making important reforms in the future and we'd definitely raise prices in Mexico and Canada that stare\nAt it that it seems to me ... what's going on here Laurie and and reality check this for me please um is that\nDonald Trump on the campaign trail identifies a real problem NAFTA has caused over a million jobs to be lost in the United states that the government acknowledges him and most people you know or the of the opinion that it's certainly probably you know six eight ten million jobs are lost as a result in after whatever it may be a huge\nA number one so he says I Want to do something about this\nThen so everybody goes yeah great you know what's it like this guy and I think that that's you know that really helped him in Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio et cetera Wisconsin\nAnd then he takes the terrible deal and two weeks it a little bit gets rid of some of the really obsessed obscenely objectionable stuff\nBut then an adult as we had a bunch of goodies for his buddies um uh you know who are supporting his campaign and giving them money and at the end of the day is pretty much a wash is really not going to bring jobs back it's really not going to solve the the big problems that we are confronting\nUm but he gets to declare victory and for the rooms and watch Fox News they're all going to think he actually did what he campaigned on is that are being too cynical or is that an accurate analysis\nThat may be where we are when the thing comes to Congress next year I think it's worth reserving judgment\nOne really important about two really important reason is the one that's the outstanding issue so there are some serious changes in this agreement\nI think it's an exact description of Trump and what he's up to but it's also the case that his top trade guys in the U.S trade representative is a guy named Robert Lighthizer\nAnd he's a serious guy for and he has opposes NAFTA and investors state tribunals and job outsourcing super smart and he's the guys in running the show on this so he actually has made some real changes that are that are worth harvesting that are important that could make a difference\nSo the investors state dispute settlements system those outrageous corporate\nCourt lights and tribunals are\nWhacked way way way back that corporate lobbies hysterics about this the investor incentives that basically subsidized job outsourcing the protections that meant less risky and cheaper moves got whacked that's that's the real stuff object transformational stuff actually do however\nOf your point about some of the corporate bodies they left a little opening a loop hole into ... oil and gas companies can try and why angle their way back into a state so it's like hey you know Ninety percent solution on a very big problem so that\nThey wrote some decent labor standards including this fairly dramatic antics\nThat for the first time would require that workers in Mexico get secret ballot elections on their union contracts right now\nThere's like a there's like a whole rackets were these companies basically get paid by the boss to register a union they are themselves you know written down as a union but it's a business and the constitution in Mexico requires a union to be registered and so these guys come in before the first workers higher than the plant's been bill they\nNegotiate contracts they register it and the ... the the workers come in to a brand new fancy multimillion dollar plant and\nGetting paid a buck fifty an hour to go on strike this just happened to the Goodyear plant in Mexico and son Louis Post to the ...\nAnd the guys down there are getting paid buck fifty eight now are the guys in Kansas City making the same tier\nFor the same auto companies are getting paid twenty five twenty eight dollars an hour the guys down there and also the working conditions or a super unsafe to go on strike and they get fired they get beaten up to get sent to jail and they're informed do you have a contract you have a union you're violating or course they never voted for any of that crap so there's an axe\nThat would get rid of that requires all those big protection unions must be replaced him for years and that Mexico must provide secret ballot elections for contracts going forward now that could actually be made sufficiently enforceable\nThat could make a big difference for people's lives in Mexico and that would help stop drag of Mexico's a very low wages I mean Tom Mexico's wages now\nForty percent manufacturing wages are forty percent below coastal China they're down in real terms since NAFTA [noise] well so this is the only reason I don't say you know how the hell with it\nIs because this guy Bob ... has made some real changes on some real important thing and if they can follow through and actually make those labor changes in force at all and\nThe loop hole for the oil and gas companies is removed from the investor state basically large ... otherwise whacking a way of those outrageous tribunals he could make a difference in stopping new corporate attacks\nAlmost four hundred million dollars isn't paid out in the first twenty five years of NAFTA in attacks on water timber toxic you name it energy policies and\nYou know what what was your scope and what it wasn't I Would assume they're going to have to answer that if in fact it's been narrowed with the interference from the White House that may actually cause I'm some boats to go against capping off Republican may yes\nIt may who vide especially for Collins or extreme heat\nFor Collins and maybe I'm ... yeah it may provide heat if they and frankly flake himself who asked for this I mean if you ask for something and then it just you find that is directly narrowed by the White House the White House can ask for something for example in the case of\nAnita Hill you know it was asked for they did a three day look at everything but the White House as I understand in that case didn't say here's what you look at they told them to look at you\nKnow the are the allegations against Clarence Thomas\nYeah I Wonder where you know I'm ... and all those animals anyhow when I was a I'm\nSorry ... anyway yeah I wanted to say it but you know you can always say well it's inconclusive no matter what the FBI says I'm staying on the on the topic of the you know releasing Information Center ... represented Maxine Waters has denied on she died this weekend of the agent or office posted personal confidential information about three members of the um\n[noise] read the Judiciary Committee who are Republicans and that was backed up by uh the IT section by the way of the U.S house because they they can determine I piano addresses you know et cetera so I didn't want to mention that 'cause I got a little bit of a of\nControversy toward it over a period of time we are looking at NAFTA it's to be determined yet what exactly it means I mean I think it's positive that there was a deal caught frankly uh I didn't think Canada was going to come into it whatsoever but it did at nine o'clock or nine thirty right before the uh [noise]\nYou know the deadly I've been told Tom I don't know if you picked up anything that this was orchestrated by Jared Kushner if you pick that up trade deal yes\nNo I my understanding is the Robert Lighthizer has been running the show right but\nI I was told and I don't know my friends on Capitol Hill to cushion or had a huge a back and forth was I don't know doing some type of talking with somebody in Canada too\nOh yeah he might be the guy who brought Canada into it I I just I have no idea I haven't ...\nI don't have it confirmed by Showtime but I Do want to mention that that was possible so we've got to see the details of it and where you know in fact uh it all ways down Iran has launched missiles into eastern Syria and that's a basic retaliation\nOr they are saying uh against the middle ... over there who have stirred a lot of um different uh you know obviously movements against it in ... in the southwestern our return\nOn their loans in support of Assad essentially\nRight right and that's the or the military which is also against the Saudi and against Iran and of course Iran is pointing out you know the implications the involvement of Saudi Arabia and it shows again that remains to be a little bit of a powder keg\nYeah I was just going to say Saudi Arabia can't be happy that Iran is helping Assad\nAll right and and there's proxy wars and then you have John Bolton in the White House who was constantly saying bomb bomb bomb and a is a great influence was you know\nHis position with the White House you know say and then a there's a new democratic strategy this is fascinating ah I like grassroots politics\nAnd if you look what President Obama has been saying about uh you can bring your hand you can yell you can be angry and that's good but you need to do certain things or the national democratic training committee indeed tc is launching the first ever online training platform it's called vote builder it's targeted by the waste almost specifically\nFor the most part two legislative races where you know the Democratic side is lost some causes coming interests hands on a boat for legislative races that's great to fight back against millionaires\nProvided their phone number ... ... ... even worth you know how we've we've talked many times or how hard it is for people to a neighbor two factor authentication where they get the ... uh for for secondary codes to protect our account\nOr how that Facebook has been using the phone number that people provide for two factor authentication for ads which was from a security standpoint\nIs that it doesn't stop them they go up and do anything like that it's a terrible thing because when you want people to use this kind of security\nThat they have every expectation they should have every expectation that the information they give their phone number will only be used for that purpose when they're used in other ways like that it's it's it's terrible in from countries that they act and they'd be criminal to do that though Facebook to keep making mistakes I gotta\nI gotta thank Loren appreciated happy sixty year anniversary to NASA isn't that amazing let's check in

Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and\nSo not yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional so the things coming out of left field shock some surprises you're on us will cross over the sun\nThe solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six to get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three and that's one of the big things that\nMundane astrologers of my field people look at these kinds of things like a nation's chart\nNations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts\nStates of the union have charts\nBut America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about cribs films now crypto does this\nBrings up something I find really fascinating and and this is a one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest monolith even actually looked at by\nPeople going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were chart and believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were astronomers they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything\nExactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water\nTo make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years Jupiter and Saturn have been an earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it but what's gonna happen is\nOn December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now those two planets\nSaturn marriage together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air signs and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more on line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we're we're ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh or should I say unfortunately that's yeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter's granted it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter\nAnd um exercise an engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but some of Saturn at the beginning of the year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world's\n... why does it work more why does astrology\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets are throwing down raise this is what the old idea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness of pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt's inside of us okay so in other words\nIn everything depends on\nSomething being born in a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb if the ... still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that is free than taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually use for the American strike because it was our first\nBreath were were saying you guess what England were independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do so the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon the various planets it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person a president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time\nUh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states for baby being born\nMore with mark Lerner the astrologers

I'm\nInterested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can tell that we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob yeah hello ah Jersey Joe are you good welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did back you okay great you're you're on with mark learner a given mark your birth date to your time go get mark\nWell if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nOf course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourist rising and he's born very close to her first quarter moon I'm old as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctual a so with an areas moon coming from other lives in like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in otherwise particularly in the last life and now with the sun a Capricorn is kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of do things more um\nGrounded more practically in order to sort of rise up the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy to that um he doesn't\nBecome pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle over the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nWhy do you have a question to\nUh yeah what if what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not alone now again you want to kind of like um well\nMy feeling is that people should study things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on\nUm go to our website to see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics astrology that the power of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of\nA steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing we're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess so how would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people in mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric strategy there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people I talked about\nThe ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kinda thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things indefinitely that are there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOr incarnations like in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... under ... reincarnation astrological you speaking you were born in the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman that are going to being able to come into the world Eleanor suspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibration they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents had family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing went to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nActually let's go out to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program and that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in

didn't know it didn't\nIt at all and it's hard to believe an even told us at the time that he had been followed by\nI'm On marching bands they didn't have a license plates or something on them a ... throughout the\nDay in and around Phoenix and they also said at one point that\nHe had a um some UFO material and um it was flying a plane and or in a black briefcase which he laid down on the on the seat\nA heart or or or or or he lay down that popped up against the seats the briefcase was when he went to pick it up it was that somebody had exchange somebody rape case where the exact same looking briefcase\nAnd a ... he said that he had been a perfect followed around by an unmarked demands and I'm scared I'm a little bit but he is he's still in that last words he said that he was ready to began writing his book and just as they said that\nThe ... back in about a month later he was gone shot himself they say that that's what they say yeah\nEven got a small grants from the office of

are over there wasn't that that's correct yeah yeah but uh\nHe had a and actually Andrew I help them to drop all a quite a bit in writing the book I spent many hours at our home had her hauled back in the mid nineties and when she wrote firestorm and she did a tremendous job on bringing McDonnell back to life and uh\nBut she uh\nEyes I told her that\nMcDonalds had these little black a\nSort of pads that he would write on and ... Mendez or in this code after that and um people and and keep on now the thing is that\nThat uh somebody else one right yeah and the thing is that a after he died nobody could find those little black patch even even as a wife that see a either didn't know about them or or didn't know where they might have been\nHe got into an argument with Jay Ellen Heineken or the two of them really never got close to that where you basically accused China of withholding project Blue Book information and agreed he said he said a hundred words were\nYou find your really disclosed when I knew the air force would have fired me and I would basically been out of a job\nThat's correct as a matter of fact you slam there's fest down on a ... when I spent the day with chronic and and uh and and ... are they brought that up\nBecause I didn't think it was fair of key hope but but uh I I think it later years a valet began to understand hiding more and of course he wrote a really nice um I'm\nA thing and and drop all talk about the McDonalds and classy kinda compared\nThem is to really I'm a scientist silver got above a deal at the at the at the end because a lot of people just wouldn't believe them\nWhat is your ... your Gordon about McDonald's duty commit suicide or do you think somebody robbed him out\nMy gut tells me the ladder I because\nEverything at every time he lives in that home and it must have been a half a dozen times where he became an did they say he uh uh\nYou would have seen assigned you would've seen someplace\n... with ... with a famous fine although and does bring up and her mom said he didn't have this um this depression problem she\nSaid they even that uh even his wife and of course his his wife I guess was having an affair or something and she was mixed up with the black Panthers and stuff like that and like Donald type seem to take it in stride so I think something happened to him and I think he was a we're\nAbout to go public with anything with the UFOs\nHere was rated writers park and that's going public because he had he had something he was already had a we even had a briefcase with\nWith the notes that they had in the bark and he told that call and Marty in myself that uh he was ready to start writing his book and a about a month later he was gone\nWe didn't do you see a secretary general of the United nations at the time or Utah ... didn't he arranged for McDonald's speak at some group conference\nSo yesterday that that was back I don't know about sixty seven something like that he did I not fact that I think that's in my book as well I have a lot of McDonalds stuff in there\nThey are yeah it did he dead and a ... but it and make big headlines or anything like that if he were alive today where do you think you'd be do you\nCall my goodness that's a good question I don't know I think that the he would have written the book and it probably would have been really something\nThat we're not long the lid off your phone's\nNot try it I think it would have had the thing is that the hand drawn for once she started doing her by a biography firestorm um\nWas a\nEven looked as if he had he had dreams of materials stacked in warehouses in Phoenix area\nAnd she even tried to look at a ... a behind the planks of the walls to see it there were any material\nBecause apparently he was known for trying to hide material in weird places like all the little black books that he had that we saw him well where are you what would he would we would sit and talk a been\nA point that seemed to really striking me get out of his little black book and write it real quick and then put it back in his pocket it again and they weren't able to find any of those little\nThink wow great I'm first ah well\nI got a a experience I think it was two thousand for gene I'm I was driving and when I'm up about a and a\nFew of those a a green try and go look and shoot 'em\nUp with a star but it was moving side to side really prize for a little bit I work I got\nTwo minutes I'll be recorded I was going to see you guys have video first off you know I'd love to see a lot of uh let me know language on it all is on a ... up nine hours drive and stuff but I mean\nWe're ... we're on the air and all only look at you know okay [laughter] uh but I'm\nMoving to cyber all ... a little bit and then um I mean the other truck drivers talking on the CD and trying to discuss this figure it out\nI found a job when it finally went away and watch it went from green to a like a dark orange color rambunctious completely disappeared out of nowhere ha ha I didn't I didn't get the video of disappear and unfortunately not drawing record so much while you're trying to drive a semi trucks you know yeah you got them run\nOn a grand already know Jesus state and it was\n...

I'm Sorry we're not bowing at the altar of radical Islamic mullahs in Iran that chant death to America death to Israel\nAnd that the sanctions now are resulting in a massive dramatic\nNegative impact on the Iranian economy which made just a night and fuel a freedom of revolution that perhaps would bring about change for the for the tyranny and oppression for the people of around one day\nAnd the same with China well president starting a trade war well we have a bad trade deal with China\nHow dare this president step up and tell our NATO allies to pay their fair share when we're paid Seventy cents of every dollar\nAnd Angela Merkel who's not paying her fair share in Germany is helping make why to mirror rich again in Russia rich again the hospital regime that that is in the hospital after that he is\nBy giving billions of dollars to Russia for the white blood of the German economy and buying their energy from them why are they buying it for months\nBecause if they do it it it weakens the one person the NATO alliance to supposed to be afraid of\nOr that the president is asking a European allies to step up with their unfair trade deals you know so now we've got an a brand new nobody bought it can happen if you don't demand and say okay we're not taking a one sided deal anymore or the president now has gotten new\nDeals with Mexico and Canada\nAnd we find out that it brings trade piece to North America just like we now have results nobody expected in North Korea and we now look at the deal that we're seeing the impact of the deal and to avoid tariffs Seventy five percent of

years to sell their name brand products in Canada before they go generic well that's up two years and billions of dollars in many cases\nThere's no increase protections on intellectual property there are no changes in US Steel and aluminum tariffs and the deal preserves a trade dispute settlement mechanism to Canada fought hard to maintain to protect their lumber industry and other sectors guess what a better deal\nBetter deals don't happen unless you demand better deals\nAs like record low unemployment doesn't happen by accident you got to cut taxes and you gotta and burdensome regulation\nAmerica can never be energy independent unless you open Anwar unless you get rid of burdensome regulations on the coal industry and and the natural gas industry and you allow drilling and

Hawaii ... men to shut up now she wants the FBI to investigate and ice throwing incident at a college bar\n... you gotta be kidding me when he was in you know a young guy and yell and that apparently\nThere was a former classmate said he drew ice at a party and somebody I ... let me tell you what's going to happen this week Mitch McConnell and the Senate leadership most of which I don't have a lot of respect for but\nThey have been good on this I think they've handled it properly with the seriousness deserves and also the resolve that an injustice has also occurred here we'll see what\nSenator snowflake is running for president yesterday in Massachusetts that do and say about it McConnell saying earlier today that he wants to vote this week in the Senate\nAnd for that to happen Jamie depraved remind the majority leader must file cloture by Wednesday that's tomorrow will be here tomorrow in the nation's capital in order to force a final vote by Saturday otherwise\nYou vote wouldn't officially be this week I'm so for example if the cloture vote\nIs if you filed cloture on Wednesday the final votes on Saturday if you filed on Thursday it's on Sunday violent on friday the vote would be next Monday if you file cloture on Saturday It's Tuesday depending on when the FBI report comes in\nSo that's going to be wide open and whether or not\nThe three Republican senators go along with endless investigations is ultimately I guess going to be up to them Lindsey Graham who's going to join us later was on Hannity last night and I thought he had a pretty good idea I said you know what we can turn this whole election and thirty five days into a referendum\nBrett capital what would happen if something really where did occur and where one vote short here's what I Would

appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man\nBut the most important thing he said was I don't question that a Christine Blasey\nFord was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what do you use a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons you may have conflated to different uh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand\nA but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion when they got\n... and contrast\nThat with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't wear holding himself that nobody's going to blame them and I'm telling you\nNobody would've believed him and he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by coaching somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said why she was ... she was initially legal she was credible\nThey they believe that I met him in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself that was a massive over more because I think it was authentic\n... where to go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona and Nevada\nAnd but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip off that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court in large\nBuddy will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins\nA and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others\nAre who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair a standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United states some Senate could could meet\nThat standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit ah in her most recent interview with NBC News show you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the interview which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple multiple I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points and when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was\nNear the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up buddy I saw him in the hall and nobody else I mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time are we even believe that no girl that was raped\nNo boy that saw the drugging of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer nobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still\nNo no go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on his face as you say just as I Do uh the the sweat Nick ... while the other sweating the allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said\nI mean it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held a pack after one and it for sure after multiple times just sat on hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term if the FBI find something really damning which I truly that\nNothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad say either way and then the people know that that what they've done is way except that I Am ...\nAnd I think for the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrats and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a ...\nAnd the Democrats heading act the way they have then I lost and them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for it's fighting and ultimately winning and we we always blame our losses in the Senate on these ... these moderate than these west isn't the traders I don't want to say\nTrader literally threatened with these people you don't have any gods or actually liberal than Republican clothing and it's true but we still have to win so we we can't give up this fight we got to take it to them and we got to win this fight and blame 'em anyway in the middle serves\nGot to take a break we'll come back Greg Jared the Russia hopes David ... new book is out today he

Kavanaugh entered sprint mark judge to spike punch at parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she thought either man spike it\nAnd you see Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know fighting the punch in my life I saw him getting rent so low cost quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch\nThat when the malls or the punch containers I don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends to remember things parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers parties\nAnd we have we haven't heard from his friends so I'm asking you know are there people alive today I thought it was partly out of there are people that know about that part and he's\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of friends she says went to the parties with her one of them said teachers not recall a Julie sweating it another of the friends she named siege we've reached out to the other two and hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now totally a top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with nothing at all it was was\nAbsolute I how does this task for a news\nStory when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statements you release just a week ago you would think you can say consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women and girls young girls were being drugged\nWith quite luge and and ... and young boys would then line up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that this happened thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parrot told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead\nAnd on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does how do you where we're at the news standard in any capacity\nHere to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she now coming out with another allegation jokes today\n... hey Shaun what's going on under is going to be the thing I think everybody's got to come to mind a war on on the basis of the lack of government\nUh there's no way to store if you're ever had been reported probably shouldn't have bought it was given in part I'm\nDue to the news networks I'm\nPraying about Michael I'm an addict or a lawyer\nBut once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is a problem where you're correct\nOr at least where you can create what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are that there was nothing to the story um and when you offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just\nPlayed a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and your your answer the phone so I'm ... story is already out there and has already gone to manage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted him no floods investigation that's now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but what if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse\nIn her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself as well as Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think it was the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace Julie sweat next or but on the original story the Christine forward a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding\nUm is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like Peter Smith and mark judge amazingly enough they're telling the FBI the same thing I told you to share a committee which they have no memory at all\nTo support the now I think it probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal with the party entry in the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm very listening who was that the party and it didn't match up with um with Christine foreign to counter this but they thought this was a big deal so\nLet's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeaky or who had not been interviewed earlier or and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about a Christine ports are allegations so\nI listen I I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out um that there is no evidence\nTo support that we did find out actual real evidence to support it than I change my mind by I don't think it's there\nWell if you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes\nAnd she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to\nTo question professor Ford who showed incredible respect on her\nBut she pointed out a heat said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself and then she goes on this case has even weaker than that\nAnd then she stopped afford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nPolicies before electrical contractors in Philadelphia this afternoon just as a New York times reported he helped his parents hide money on tax returns for decades

that time is now to secure your wealth with precious metals by calling the gold silver group today and eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\nWell I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh we legitimize the way he was treated\nIf the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict at the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap would abandon Kevin\nThe traditional way of doing business is a detail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on him less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats or rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already has a matter of fact that most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump us right they've already against score six\nAnd yeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think the impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting to FBI to check the committee's homework I get that that will be done here shortly\nBut you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp devote no\nI don't agree with you I Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you spoke into these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so\nYou mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process is ... this is about the future of the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know this about who would come forward after this debacle\nIs about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the Sherry and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician\nThat he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have allied salvaged\nHave a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota\nIs I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight that people in North Dakota North Dakota sport Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding\nOf what their colleague from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is that I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo to being a party line vote which humor at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care if it's like you know I'm a Baptist and I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh's highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled are good for you and now here's the point and\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow votes short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves I think ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made a donor and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about cabinet I'll put that\nOn a limb is this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those owners on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative when you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage the homophobic Xena ...\nYou're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children and it's got to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long\nAnd now with Supreme Court nominees\nSlander has been taken to a whole new level you and you have a night throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\n[laughter] yeah adding ice that darned granny over the cliff is the new standard so it's gotten ridiculous it started as a brush fire again back to the doctor for she's been betrayed by the other side as much as anything else are we are where we are but I ...\nSurfers go on and now you've got the Democrats would never had any intention of oh we want we want to do this expeditiously very very limited in scope Senator Flake of you can just go along with us now they want an ice throwing incident\nIn college investigated\nThis is how desperate they are to not ever have a vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nFor NBC News do run what they ran last night well look for people that she gave us to corroborate this story well one is dead the other says she doesn't know who she is and the other two wouldn't call us back\nAnd then multiple inconsistencies cheap changing their story while he was around the punch bowls ... where it was they were spiking the punch bowl with choir you lose and drugs and these these young boys lined up\nWith well I saw him in the halls I don't know if he was one I saw him in the halls\n... thing that happened on a ... almost a weekly basis ... that that boys were drugging girls and gang raping the and that went on for a long time and then you change the story\nAt what point does is there any shame left among people I understand the importance of the Supreme Court\nIf you want to be able to pick Supreme Court nominees you've got to win elections this is why thirty five days from now matters so much Christmas in Columbia Chris welcome to the program\nMr ... thanks um I just wanted to say that his former police officer I listened to ... testimony and there were a couple of things that I found to cause some credibility issues with her statements I'm\nFirst that her friend being able to notice that you don't want to a girl to gathering disappeared and she never to this day followed up on it and secondly at the grocery stores two months later when she runs into her attacker one of her attackers recollection is is that she tried to get out of sight feeling ill\nIt's that she engage him in conversation with high and she remembers how he ...\nLook at it that there's so much wrong with these in terms of if you're going to name people and you're going to say they were at these the ... at at at where crimes were committed and attack took place and those people do not\nCorroborate your story now we're going back thirty six years I understand some people's memory but they're adamantly denying it and I witnessed one eye witness\nIt siding with Brett Kavanaugh others never ever ever happen or girl girlfriend says I don't ever remember being at any such party when you're going to make serious allegations\nLike this you can't have groups of people that are supposed to be lawmakers that are rooted in you know laws are rooted in truth\nProcess due process constitutional law presumption of innocence all declaring they believe even before people were hurt you care about him because it that's now the standard you're guilty by accusation\nYou argue anybody can make any accusation\nAnd I believe the accusation we have\nNo rule of law at that point throughout the whole process nobody and I have watched this process now on bold was\nRichard jewel Duke lacrosse Ferguson, Missouri Cambridge police Baltimore, Maryland Trayvon and George Zimmerman everybody thinks they know and they all end up being wrong because they rush to judgment\nAnd maybe with the FBI investigation and the disastrous interview on NBC yesterday\nMaybe now people will understand that it's falling apart and people's names character reputations family they'd been blood for political\nReasons are are good front Amy Kramer is checking in with us or Amy Hi how are you you're wonderful daughter highly is now joined our team here on the Sean Hannity show that you can give you the back number or did you call in and actually get a\nShot I Hope you all can handle or she's little firecracker and they for taking care of her up there\nShe's doing great we love and and only one I appreciate you at all you you do and the teams that Sean I have to tell you something I never in my life expected to be on the same page with Lindsey Graham and inviting hand from one of our of that and actually we done that and this week and\nHe's he just I mean he ... the phone last week that he not\nWell I think ... you know and that's another thing well he doesn't have the temperament\nNow if you if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault and your innocence and\nHow was the what is the proper way to act was he supposed to be monotone guys I didn't do this but it's just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and it ... it right it it said\nAnd the half the country and these people they don't care they don't care who they destroyed in the process of accumulating power\nAnd honestly it doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and I and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh\nCould have been anybody this is much bigger it's about them stopping the Supreme Court confirmation that's what it's all about they are willing to do anything to stop it and these liberal women these peak hat wearing liberal women out there speaking like they speak for all women they don't they absolutely do not\nEnd when it does press in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle and we're just not going to sit back and take it we're the one for a sixty\nSix and I did take these women have been fighting the vote women were the ones that elected Donald Trump women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in this then\nTurns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kind of that together and we're pushing back on all of this and said they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to get back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the ... whether or not I looked at Santa's going to hold a vote and a big Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue what is it your lovely the that convinces them is not qualified for the job you know the guy admits\nThat he drank he liked to drink drink beer still like to drink beer is sometimes drink more beer that he should have a drink\nYou
