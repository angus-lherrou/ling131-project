Fifteen languages on the side yeah\nYeah on the outside the Arabic Farsi well when you when you Senegalese new will win that again is that a language\nI don't know why and it should be that voting requires speaking in reading English\n... does anyone I mean I mean\nIt's nice that we we have the you know like the what what I called the it's a small world finals tabloid where you have all the

find out from the daily mail that they were organized by the Democratic socialist\nOf America were there were all singing the same ... literally singing the song I say more so of\nCourse that the press coverage was Pittsburgh doesn't like Trump doesn't want Trump even though Trump won Pittsburgh doesn't want Trump well\nWe'll play you some of the commentary from MSNBC I wanted to you know I'm In\nThe area we want the chance we want all that changed obsessively\n... is a president attacked\nFor consoling victims of a tragedy full stop what President was attacked by four four consoling victims of a tragedy Obama wasn't attacked George W. Bush wasn't attacked and they shouldn't be this is part of the presidential role but that's not what we heard yesterday\nAnd if he didn't go they would have just\nA ... well they tried that routine but they're good looks he's holding a rally on the same day when there's tragedy goes to lead to know the tragedy was going down that day he continued the rallying as he told you in the interview you can't be cowed by these people to stop down your way of light rail doesn't you know in Israel does Israel ...\nOr call the eight hundred car sixty one hundred and mentioned the code lord remembered it up when they apply [noise]\nCan't let up on election day remember everybody was saying a year ago when you hadn't Virginia in Alabama they were saying the Democrats won't come out we'll get our bowed out of usual turnout now instead of two ... two million in Virginia had two point six million and there was a ... percent more Democrats fish here the Republicans have to stay fired up\nRight through Tuesday and that's why the president's out there doing the rallies still\nFor before election day\nHe's going to be all over the country's going all the way to Montana back down to Florida\nWe learn more information by the way about Andrew Gillum yesterday which we're going to share with you\nLet me tell you something if the great people of Florida want San Francisco style results in their beautiful state then definitely vote for Andrew Gillum the mayor of by the most dangerous city and all of Florida Tallahassee\nWho is just it's proven himself to be willing to do pretty much anything for a donor or someone posing as a downer\nAnd now he's caught using campaign money expensing out to a campaign private plane to go a new campaign work to do to do a you know work mixing up the government business or the campaign business\nSo that came out yesterday so people in this country have got to see through that you you mean just because someone\nIs a smooth talkers doesn't mean that person is going to have the right answers for your state and Galen kind of fit that bill but you know what else I was thinking if you want Bob Menendez is corruption to come to Florida definitely vote for Andrew Gillum\nAs your new governor Rhonda Santa's it's got to be the only choice we in Florida but Menendez the fact that Bob Menendez is even remotely\nIn in in this home stretch close to a perhaps being reelected is just beyond humor in that and humorous at the same time Bob and end as is the poster boy for the word corruption in politics\nAnd joining us now the man who seeks to send him packing the races basically in a statistical dead heat Bob here in the Republican running against Bob Menendez joins us now Bob it's great to talk to you how you're feeling out there and what the reaction you're getting out on the campaign trail\nLaura were incredibly energized great to be with you I have to tell you our governor Phil Murphy and some of the policies we have a New Jersey I've got to be helping uh both Rhonda Santas and Rick Scott in Florida because they're driving everybody out of the free can say to New Jersey because of the high taxes on affordability to Jersey so\nHopefully they'll they'll vote for them and even though I'm a ... a few votes for the acts of this but we're working hard wouldn't turn Jersey around we're we're very optimistic and credibly energized\nA Bob there's a piece in\nThe star ledger which is one of you know I always called the red Star Ledger so left wing ... there was an editorial the other day um and the\nTitle was choking down his vote for ... basically they know that it's really bad but because you're a Republican and you worked for a pharmaceutical company made money on pharmaceuticals\nThat you're basically the same person so you might as well vote for the guy the devil you know that's essentially the argument that the bats at the star ledger can do is choke it down and vote for him and us\nIt's it's unbelievable and the wall Street Journal did a good job to put\nThose in perspective those the logic was they had there and the sad thing Laura about the whole thing is here's a guy who's been in Washington for twenty five years sixteen years with a Democratic president and\nHe has nothing to run on it's like come\nOn you want is a job interview for another six years and I want to talk about how much attack the president I'm going to attack the candidate I'm not going to tell you anything I've done to help you with the people in Jersey or so over taxed he's voted for more than five hundred tax increases and\nThis is the guy that you're going to re elect it's time for change\nWell the the amazing thing again going back to this pathetic endorsement and the star ledger which is still read in in the state is that they the star ledger trashes Cory Booker in governor Murphy\nFor endorsing Menendez when they said someone better could have run so I mean ... ... ... again I just want everyone in New Jersey listening to that\nThere is no real argument for returning Menendez to power it's so corrupt in New Jersey that the only argument that they can make it he's not a Republican oh and Bob Hugh getting a praise Donald Trump in what is a one of his a chairman of your chair and finance chair in New Jersey\nWell I I imagine people are enjoying the economic revival in this country pretty well and especially a lot of those a Wall Street or to live in New Jersey and commute into the city so the idea that they're not enjoying this economic revival brought on by Trump's policies as absurd\nAs people who Jersey really differentiate\nOn the fact that listen we want somebody independent of New Jersey at the short of the stick for so long it's time for the people in New Jersey to get pushed first and and not some party or politics and in New Jersey is lucky that we've had the economic revival in the country because it's being dragged along and\nAnd we need to do things and the jurors are going to focus on putting our state in the right direction and higher taxes more government spending is absolutely not the ... not the solution Jersey it's the problem of New Jersey and\nAnd and and I tell you you know you think about your children or grandchildren I have three kids my daughter works at your body over New York and my two sons are station to camp Pendleton California in the marine corps I Want them to be able to come back to New Jersey when the time comes we want to raise a family et cetera\nThat's the role model if you want and and the and the policies make of sewn affordable and it it's disrespectful to the people people chose who took people just deserve but it's time to restore honoring bigger the integrity of the office and that's where we're going to do on November the ... the\nBut you get a ... or you getting enough help from a outside and I know New Jersey like my home state fairly liberal even though there's conservative elements and conservative kind of pragmatism in in New Jersey\nFrom Alec Baldwin that he was going to leave they never do no follow through on their promises typical liberal\nShe admitted it's Seventy six year old star that she's

arrived to behave like a normal nation if they'll do that we're happy to allow that\nTo the community of nations but we we we have to continue to apply pressure and on Monday of the week ahead we'll put back in place sanctions that will be very severe on the leadership of Iraq and we hope that that will convince them to change their ways\nMr Secretary you have a cold I can hear a just a bit poor guy while you're flying all over ...\nAll all all the you'll find no sympathy needed Lara Brown either as a as a mother I worry about all my friends who are like that thank you for ... science here with us up so it ... right now the Europeans\nAre there there's there's a developing and persistence splitting opinion on what to do with the Iranian minutes where is Germany today given the fact that Merkel is out as a party\nA leader she's in her last term are clearly opposition forces in Germany more populist or anti migration our political on\nLower so far the German government has not changed his position that still wants to stay inside of the Jaycee pie away but\nNearly every German company folks with real money at risk made the opposite decision they have fled they have left they decided they are not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday [noise]\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I am convinced that over time all of the European countries will come to see the around it is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the middle east and that we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that to fix it\nSo the sanctions gun place on Monday correct\nYes ma'am Monday and they'll feel them immediately or will it take a little time to settle and\nSo are there are already feeling with them but a mess the days go on a pressure will increase we will substantially drop the amount of crude all their primary revenue source that they could ship around the world a treasury will put back in place sanctions on financial institutions there\nAnd we hope that the things we put on individuals and in other places will convince the leadership and we we walk the Iranian people to be successful we want this to be a successful country we want to restore democracy that we we think the Iranian people want that same thing\nAs our aim is uh not to hardly renting people but to change the behavior the malign activity of this regime\nAre just going back to Germany a boy have Merkel's fortunes changed obviously she'll be finishing up her last term but she's been there for Thirteen Years or so\nUh and uh she's leaving ahead of her party well how will that change our dealings with Germany in the in the near term and what do you see as the political climate in Europe with the rise of cell Vinnie and the challenges that you'd say thing\nSo we have many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some were um we don't share the same view the president\nHas been direct with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that the primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia crates hum a reside in Europe not in America\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments evaluate this sees that America is with them were happy to assist them but they have the primary responsibility we hope that each of these governments will come to see that in the way that President Trump is so clearly laid out\nA CNBC reported yesterday Mr Secretary that North Korea is reportedly preparing nuclear and missile sites\nFor international inspectors are what can you tell us about I Know you're going to go meet with your not North Korean counterpart just a matter of days but what's the latest from ah North Korea\nSo I Can't say much about what's taking place on the ground but I can make clear that when I was with chairman Kim now or three weeks three

speak with my counterpart next week about and then we do have the intention of a President Trump or German Kim getting together before too long hopefully early in the next year where we can make\nA

children become American citizens ludicrous on I don't believe that for a second uh but ... verify you're absolutely right about that if you don't know what do you verify it basically\nIt's a system that's intended to authorize an individual's legal right to work in the United states and the online database according to Fox News it's supposed to verify the authenticity of the documents\nThat are provided by an employee to an employer and while the system mostly works as it's supposed to critics says say it often failed in its most fundamental goal keeping undocumented people from gaining

Fifteen called the legal workforce act which would actually mandate the system nationally it's it's an existence but it's not nationally mandated\nNow the bill passed the house Judiciary Committee it had fifty four co sponsors all of whom are Republicans so again Democrats want your job to be open to illegal immigrants do you want to know how to campaign that's what you say why there's only why

that helps everybody oh please that help everybody that's what they say about pot\nOr legalize the illegal market it will be great it'll be great you won't get any more legal immigrants crossing the border bowl of course you will just like you're getting more pot growers in the United states\nGetting a lot more pot growers you're getting a lot more people who are bringing a more potent pot and to the United states so again the the open borders crowd is always going to figure out a way to try to argue that\nYou you shouldn't worry about immigration that demographic changes don't matter that these people are all conservative crossing the border if you think all the people crossing the border illegally or conservative just look California\nOkay if you think immigration is the answer to everything that ails the country or just look at California look at how the state of Virginia has changed look at how Georgia has changed\nA Texas they could if they could flip it they would but Texans or a special on their special people and I think there are like look we're we've got great economic growth we're not going to screw this up now\nBut I still believe that Trump on this issue of

in the United states over ten year period all of their public statements and what they're actually lobbying for\nThe question I'm asking here by the way is what do we do about our billionaire problem we have a problem with the morbidly rich here in the United states\nI personally think a wealth tax if you if you have a ... if you have wealth in excess of a billion dollars than every year you pay one percent of everything above a billion dollars to the government\nI realize that's considered ... story right you know it's literally the government taking somebody's money\nBut it is it is good for American society it's good for democracy and it's not going to hurt these families you're telling me that if you've got a hundred and five billion dollars like the Koch brothers and you have to pay a billion dollars in taxes every year\nUntil you're down to just one billion dollars which is not going to happen in your lifetime that that somehow got to harm you\nI'm not buying it taking away people's health care like Rick Scott ... that that causes people to die so what is it that the wealthiest people are doing and they looked at the hundred wealthiest billionaires in the United states

applies to the wealthiest Americans himself posed a government regulation of the environment\nOpposed to government regulation of big banks\nUnenthusiastic about government programs to help with the jobs to help maintain incomes of working people to provide healthcare to American people or for retirement pensions they broadly oppose all these things are they just don't care\nAnd they're all in favor of cutting or privatizing guaranteed Social Security benefits so the\nQuestion what do we do about this\nShould we do about it there's a lot of other stuff in the news as well and we as a as I mentioned earlier or we're going to talk with Phoenix Goodman and about four minutes here about public banking scenes or even the Phoenix\nThe co founder of probably saying that way you get to that
