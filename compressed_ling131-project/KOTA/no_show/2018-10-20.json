foundation that was delayed by this guest joining us now Patrick Jay Buchanan thank you for being here pat\nGood to talk with you or I Am and not pack your take on this I mean we're seeing a ... it seems the Democrats certainly the media\nIs a renewing it's focused on this caravan indeed we have a second this is like a sequel you know there's like Roseanne you keep you you you're not one thing down and they keep reviving the thing um you have this caravan on its way to the United states against the president says this is a winner\nGiven the tight races we're seeing across the country even in Texas\nIs it a winner in your estimation\nI think it is censored as the signature issue of the president or just ... issue\nOf controlling the border securing the border building the wall halting illegal immigration a major issue in western civilization right now\nSee the folks from the south who are dealing with repression and war and poverty hardships all want to come north through Europe and United stretch ended in Naples Donald Trump to demonstrate that he's a leader on this issue this is his issue and he can take action to secure the borders\nAnd prevent what is really a third world invasion of the west so I think yeah she\nHad a why are we seeing\nThis I mean I guess this happens every time you have an incumbent president at midterm uh he risks and traditionally he loses a seat in the Senate and the house why might Donald Trump whether this better than his predecessors ... thing and did they can use the ... going to help\nI think the Kavanaugh thing right I think it helped to certainly energized many conservatives and others the Supreme Court was an issue the\nThe apparent lynching of cap and all of their belief that he wasn't getting a fair hearing and his fiery disposition\nAll manner which are tremendously exciting and interesting battle and I think it energized Republicans who were basically don't get energized and mid term elections when they're old but White House\nBut I think what this again it's an opportunity to demonstrate that he can get the job done\nAnd I think ah at of course it's a risk is involved here as well\nSo I think Trump is taking it as an opportunity and you're already modified your plate that segment I think he believes a golden opportunity for him to show he can do exactly what he promised to do and he's got a good record of keeping his promises yeah well\nWith the economy which we're going to get into later I mean uh but I you know I think sometimes Americans get swept up in the emotional moment or the headline at the moment and they forget the government and presidents have very limited powers and purposes\nAnd it really is to ensure mostly our security\nAnd then to give us a playing field where we can rest opportunities\nAnd uh and and grow into prosperity as a as a country that's the primary job\nAnd when we start looking to the side issues or whether it be you know a Trump said something you know saluted a guy who body slammed a journalist and he he's now equal to the Saudis cutting of a journalist to ribbon\nYour thought on that the emotional play\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in this mid term might that be effective given the difficulties out there\nWell I think my ... in my view the Democrats happened or were you and I mean the economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent\nAnd but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and the murder of him and this tremendously alert tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know there are there\nHave no agenda and they're seizing upon dish and tried to attach it to to Trump but ... what exactly frame and just the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do or pretend they're going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is\nThe one house of representatives of what is their agenda they don't have one\nThe big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and\nI'm now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls are the president's approval ratings are are surging\nAnd that the Republicans which we just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even buy a slim majority what do you think happened what will the next year look like what Trump\nI'm sure didn't help [laughter]\nI wasn't actually a general gauge shouldn't you know as far as the eye\nAnd said anything that can enact anything they can't you know ... revised Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate then shut it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything\nThey will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia they're going to get the Boulder report W looking into alleged\nYou know alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue if you're wondering if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announce that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to rich hardcore which is insufficient to win the house of representatives\nTo the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue you don't get the broad base is one of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to battle three James uh ... who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and yet this is the question\nAnd use that in July that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president had committed the crime that tree than primary bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president had committed\nReally brought it forward and the other ... life off of them voted um she's not a very political person\nAnd she even going to vote Republican\nUh for the lead terms and ah we're we're both Trump supporters because\nIn my memory he is the first president\nThat I can remember who's actually promised things and he's bringing them about ... I mean these are ... you know campaign stump things to get your attention and get your vote was actually trying to do it and you know that goes a lot closer with me as a vet\nWhen you're president is actually backing up what he said\nNo he even even invoked the vet said we're taking care of our best you mentioned that at the rally last night and I can't remember a president in office\n... yeah sure when they're running but not an office where they constantly referenced the vet and the ball and you know there there's kind of a list of things that in his own mind I think he has that he wants to accomplish in that he is accomplishing and I think that's impressive to people\nThe Democrats do not have at this moment\nThere's two things they like a real leader face and voice of their party I mean unless Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters or your faces okay\nThe cover girls of Nineteen sixty two um\nOr ...\nOr governing agenda there's no there's no jet it's not like they're saying look we want

for the economy safety or the rule of law\n... the only thing I think that happens but the president in New York so I I get a comment greens and loud and beautiful and all of that and and how we can go off on a tangent\nBut I think sometimes the rallies I sometimes I Would like to see the president you know drop the fake news things truck Pocahontas thing he's got so many good things in his corner\nOr in his in his true years\nThere's a lot of people tune it when he's on the air because they want to see what he's got to say and I get higher rally the troops and all of that but the independence or some of the Democrats that may not be happy with the party it's he would\nUh you know show what he's been doing I think his members would come up I think he can people and and trained some of that perception because when he goes by\nYou know and a little bit less of the name calling and stuff like I said I Know that rally the troops but but you got such a good record you know with the economy in the ... things that you were talking about\nYou know you keep pushing that you get some people that lightly tuned in may say you know things are you know this guy's right you know I look on line and the stock market you don't like just like sometimes they had the flag be high which is good we got out of ... but sometimes that some kind of something ...\nThings that you know accomplishments\nThat he's very good at not just the Supreme Court stuff and and the big news at some of the little things that affect this and I will say though here in Connecticut and in the current there's there's so little walk this year and a lot of the guys that I work with it's not as you hear the economic numbers\nAnd we would think that we would be roaring over here but it's a little you know\nIt's sluggish as we said at the time is it right here in Connecticut now it could be could be to get out of whole nuns and the economy and yet ... says whatever\nBut we thought a lot of us when we look at the economic numbers this or we figured it skipped real writing what because construction is going you know home improvement windows dishwashers remodeling kitchens bathrooms were rolling then you know the economy is really Raul right 'cause\nI Know it's a lack I think there are some industry is lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I\n... and here's the thing that I Would say\nAnd if you are right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman from and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already under way\nWe do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment but at the same time see there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effect of this and need to know that the aid he's doing everything he can\nBe the president is not a wizard or a magician\nThat's what happened so this tall tale\nAbout the heartless

driving to the polls to vote against these policies were\nMy family and my friends were quietly all going to go and vote straight Republican to stop that I can tell you that for sure so the border is a big issue for you\nIt's an extremely big issue because\nWe see the entire day in and out you know we live in the city of Houston uh me and my family in any of my friends but we\nWe see the impact on the communities on the school and we see the impact I cried and I I think that the classic talking points on the left would be okay with that racist or you know they just want to come and work at our church water better their lives and they're doing good but the problem is\nIs it's not sustainable and it's not right for communities that burden and we certainly do you\nKnow you you do see the

Guatemala president as a known in the country's largest newspaper that nearly one hundred ISIS terrorists have been apprehended\nIn the impoverished Central American nation why should Americans care about this the caravan of Central American migrants is making its way north let's not forget Guatemala is one of the countries that bar to the U.S with the illegal immigrant minors under Brock Obama's open borders free for all that came in\nFrom Honduras El Salvador Guatemala through the Mexican border and for years Uncle Sam rolled out the welcome mat offering housing food medical treatment et cetera anyway\nThis is the announcement that a a hundred terrorists um\nApparently ISIS terrorists have been caught in Guatemala this was on judicial watch his website we will keep you posted but\nI I got to tell you I I Do think Trump is right this strengthens his hand this is his issue border security Porter safety um stopping at a process that\nDoes not permit border\nAnd promotes chaos that was at the heart of what he ran on ... so this cuts\nI think uh his way as these midterms heat up and they get they are very close now most of the polling still shows democratic victory in the house but there is a path\nFor the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary it's very rare for president after his first you know middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political a pendulum but\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you want to just say\nOh for reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see\nFeinstein and Schumer I'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths and I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera group for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that is a swath of American\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves are all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia when we lived here Frank like\nYou're there are parts of places you you're you know I I guess you could go and never see a black person never see Hispanic face in some of these restaurants that ... ... northern Virginia for whatever reason carved up that way\nIt it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided lives separate lives not in New Orleans we are side by side we share a music we share food we enjoy each other's company we drink together we have fun together Mardi Gras together um\nAnd you hear a lot when you were in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you\nI think there's a lot of disgruntlement out there with not only the mob stuff but the tone\nAnd the lack of results from Democrats Democrats should have it seems to me come up with a governing agenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look\nThe Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they had you know what are you going to do you're gonna run against joblessness\nYou're going to run against high wages you're going to run again high benefit a business is growing small businesses regulations coming off what are you going to do well I'll tell you would come out of Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you want you want and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of Terry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focus on during the winter\n... exactly right I think the Democrats\nNot all of their ... you look at what they get a get a get out of ... capital a cabin out there because you know they were trying to control that they\n... you know there there is a bit of that people people feel like well you know change of being good now for Eighteen months after Trump but people just sort of take for granted that I was listening to watch CNN this morning 'cause I'm with the news now is you know\nAnd I'm there are only conservative out and out before I'm formulas Maggie Haberman you may know her she's with the New York times yes oh yeah liberal\nAs she was saying oh the top tax cuts that worked and I'm like Maggie I made what you're talking about Trump jak such hell on earth we're seeing wages rise we have seven million more jobs where people to build them as you just such a report just came out yesterday on a industrial production that's like the highest level\nIn Thirty

and then the third to finish something or do you want to get to some good callers I see this as for things\nAnd so but but now you've got this you know people who have been denied tribal membership who are trying to say oh well here I can do a genetic test and show that I've got you know a certain percentage of of ... and you know native ancestry\nAnd then a a you know other people of the ... there are probably some people who are members of tribes who are who have less native ancestry than there are people who have been rejected by tribes and vice versa that's just it you know it's been all over the map for years and years and years because it's been more like you know\nI you know I I not being native America yeah I Know several people who are um uh but it's you know it's just it's just a huge\nIssue in the Native American community and they've and they've all just been going you know ... genetic tests are not the way we are going to do this we'd never have we're not going to\nAnd so then when Elizabeth Warren gets a genetic test she was not applying for tribal membership she's not pretending that she's a member of a tribe she's not even identified a particular while he was just as the story that her mother told her\nBut um [noise]\nYou know it's like I I Am confident\nAs slash hopeful that this will blow over the the Native American blow back you know against her

the Democratic party basically they trained the working class and in terms of good paying manufacturing jobs\nAnd so many\nJust her what Trump was saying about jobs than about economic growth\nAnd about manufacturing and we the Democrats basically have embraced the wall street we we we talk about the stock market is being that driver of economic growth and a Trump\nAnd Martin would have been true that would have been true during the Clinton Administration and and part of that was true during the Obama administration but the Democratic party has very much changed their tune or the largest

finding themselves with small donations they've said ah the wall street can take a leap yeah there was a day when Jamie diamond and Bill Clinton or best buds a and probably still are\nBut that that Bill Clinton part of the Democratic party is fading really really rapidly and I think the Democrats have learned a lot of lessons Marta respectfully\nThanks listening to KPFK um and and and I think that we're going to see the result of those lessons in the election although you know the thing that scares me is you know like I said yesterday Greg palace said you know fourteen million people have

right again about people traveling in groups I mean we are basically trying to uh we are advancing narrative at least at the U.S government\nOr that we are trying to dissuade illegal immigration because it's unsafe pride and it allows\nA you know smugglers or human smugglers to profit so here these people are are banding together and going through official asylum channels to stay safe and yet we're also condemning them for doing that\nAnd you're right Fox News series on this talks about illegal trying to breach the border which is not at all a part of their plans but it looks like in this case Mexico is going to react differently than I did in April the big difference there is that they've now got that\nNAFTA deal rights and eat the relationship with Trump has been passed over a little bit ah unlike in April when Mexico gave the caravan the first minute left a bunch of trends of permits which allow these people to go across Mexico the Mexican government here at the Guatemalan border is basically stopping people they're saying\nIf you don't have transit papers to come through Mexico and if you are not going to apply for asylum in\nMexico then we're going to have to turn your back\nUm and they have asked I think and this is responsible policy they've asked the United nations refugee agency to come to the border there and help process these claims rapidly inevitably it's true the the Mexico's not safe everywhere but it is becoming more and more a place that is recognized as safe at least in part\nAs a place for people fleeing violence in the northern trying to uh Central America to go so I think Mexico that changed his tune here they want to preserve the slightly improved relationship with the United states\nReal quick on the road going to change one animal\nPresident of all animals and two months\nI don't know I think there are a lot of signs of theirs continuity in this government and the current government is in many ways coordinating with the incoming one to preserve the U.S relationship with along that's good that's very good so far as the news you can follow him on Twitter at things career thanking looks\nHe's inexperienced and internationally known expert on national security and foreign affairs\nYou currently serves as a national security and foreign affairs analysts for moody broadcasting radio network Salem Radio network in and it's a regular on several other radio network she recently completed in year as a Fox News military analyst he's a senior systems analyst would be the pie international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts group and his brand new book is called an alliance of evil\nRussia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you I'm doing well Richard thank you for having me feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty\nDesigned to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the I an app for the intermediate range nuclear forces training which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thought\nA lot of course the Russians are suspected in I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the youth of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile recalled the nine and seven to nine or that has um\nYou know not met the criteria is violated the criteria\nOf course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of a twenty two new start and you know President Trump said I'm ... weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across about Moscow 'cause it's a concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapon a\nAnd a two Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally crossed the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering that new area right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just it's kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nIt does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly had a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the F four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok a chain exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nSoldiers thirty six thousand a armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact through off the east coast of Russia straight out\nStates are practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely for really is where we have the mid range nuclear anti\nMissile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never\nGone away I Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nA when you called the the evil empire the Soviet Union\nA and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter a towards Moscow and of course that was violating some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear and given their\nTheir passion for free for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to POWER UP some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard or we did poke 'em and of course we continue to do that they consider a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of\nA civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course to province in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a\nFormer Soviet satellite regimes\nOr that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev step down\nCame to this country met with Bush in Camp David we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fall and I think that that really is you indicate fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has\nCaptured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result as you know really fueled nationalism and patriotism in a way that\nThat they're somewhat um I Would argue blind or to perhaps what the West is looking at because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they do have the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course a potent you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems\nOf that really a push against the emergence and a very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really where to find themselves they're pushing back\nThey are concerned about NATO and we did violate the initials trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course ... but also president Xi in China\nHow much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps smoothing over relations pulling back from the break if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a\nRussian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this is this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact potent sad you know once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July or they talked about a host of issues not first of all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things at CERN but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed production of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war in in a like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year he is trying to make sure\nThat people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of this but at the same time he does want stability he does want it in the tension but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars and and how people need to

that\nThe uh polish prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to board station armored brigades now so that they can be prepared in case uh the Russians do what they did\nNot in

Assad regime are and of course uh the Russians white their hands and that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in in any and time scenario al ... or is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned ...\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got in to say is ... thirty eight we're really talking a\nThe big dog and mad dog and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nA turkey is really a\nSeeks to be the ... and\nTo establish a house and his statements have been very very um\nConducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently ah would after great pressure we put on him that aired on a\nCooperate with this but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque now that's not\nA very typical of presidents that country's going\nAcross the world doing that sort of thing that this guy has a any consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he is a new a lot of them in and I don't think anyone that models and closely would dispute that so that these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching have\nCollaborating with the Russians who are of course a\nDay even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a lot of forces especially crude forces there near masks and operating even drones threatening a northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather\nYou see the Iranians and certainly the Turks are sort of our lives the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and\nAnd put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here and Jews battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nAs you mentioned her to one and and I wanted to ask you about church did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so um my concern would\nBe one you know if you go back to O. three\nWe tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq\nIn ... to attack Saddam you know good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had a one year to one didn't want that to happen they blocked as we ended up having to\nTake all those troops who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air the one is not being cooperative course their\nPurchase the F for hundreds\nSurface to air missiles and the Russians are they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ... from the Russian and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational\nPower plant much like they have\nDowntown to run a and on the coastlines there and you can begin to make\nPut you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what air to one one solved\nOr the it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying\nUm air defense systems that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO a sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile\nAnd that's it yeah because we will not connect our patriots and other than\nTo a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a nonstop what are we just won't do it uh and that is a\nBone of contention and of course that there are others even though we tried to maintain good relations with the Turks and up until now\nYou know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when addicts or tried to secular rice a nation or everyone is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize its uh with his his lawn like\nYou point and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire or so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we\nMentioned in the last hour or because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue or do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese are just you know very tight now out of necessity they don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can maintain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road\nStrategy of president Xi around the world and\nCollaboration with the Russians\nMilitary exercises this is all painting the picture where you can see a divided world emerging or so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of\nYou know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing turkey into our secrets and to our systems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far from the for me to to um stand up for the house of shot by a given that so much of the narrative of the show the murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible\nDo you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to drive a wedge between the\nUnited States and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's sort of thing that you know kind of the poker in the interview geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes you know who were the the people that were in the you know the Saudi\nEmbassy that night so I suppose some details will eventually come out but the clandestine type of operations no one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place on fortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals or even if the show he was you know\nDemonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a hitch men that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but uh that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten day and it's far in excess of that and we have a lot of\nPeople on the ground working hand in glove with them but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so\nI was looking at me from a bubble gum ...\nAnd all that I knew the hole in my shoe\nWas letting in water

and sixty billion\nA couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year a ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough to\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know I Know how can the Russians and the Chinese be such an adversary and competitive for a while they hide most of what you're spending on their own national security you know the answer is we'll see\nI'm a big concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cut by ... percent well we went through this quest ration period in which you just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with a new aircraft\nThese antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships\nYou know it's an incredibly expensive to have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested\nFuriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia a specially combined a fair forming a new alliance and so if we sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in investments in our our

evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast then yeah\nThank you very much a robber you were talking about the Chinese tapping our electronics for information or I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have\nProgrammed to an end date into all of these electronic chips so that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future you know they've done a little paranoid but I think it's\nVery feasible and that's really a something major that could happen a great question Steve is that possible mop\nA bond not an electronics are\nExpert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh and Jim Mattis our\nDefense secretary a is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a\nProgrammable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nSo there's always hope here and yes we do have guy an angel with that do help

Denver\nIt's the same game that all the three sixteen showed up from John three sixteen in the Bible\nPeople have yes we're in young\nPeople have painted drunk three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he wanted to be the U.S championship game against Oklahoma\nTwo or three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo showed up he had John three sixteen in passing three sixteen yards thirty one point six average per catch even CBS carry the game the rating for the game was thirty one point six percent was eyes reading again God for the game but I haven't met right either as they were kind of position thirty one minutes and seconds\nThe only intersection with their down at sixteen and robbers burger through the interception let the bill that a white horse of the top of the stadium and the one in the ... the bronco\nJudge either when you see it as I think in the stadium you see this guy in the clouds above it with the white or as well Jesus returns in late horse with clouds who has a symbol red revelation of Jesus return on a lake or some revelation the opening kickoff in America opening kick off 'cause it couldn't happen but I Want to tell you that 'cause they'll take too long but anyway go ahead and I I Want to get those facts out to be for my\nPhone cut off it's remarkable and I I remember some of that not all of the details now he's you know in the New York Mets a farm system now do you need that football and he's in baseball now like any\nYeah you know what's really interesting and baseball too is a really fascinating but I mean the other is kind of like a the when you see the halo you know the real you know as a symbol of Jesus is coming back you know there there's no doubt that\nThe oldest coincidences we're not a coincidence that there are too many even the opening kick off at the cross bar in the back of the end zone which is located tenured sleep in the end zone Rickey said back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put herself on the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch back\nThere is no way that can happen in ever happening again anywhere near you to

were having grass he was getting ready to sign on ads right on any of them had epilepsy seat or something or\nA ... where he I thought he may be resuscitated the individual but he well he he would have\nBeen over and pray for him and the guy all of a sudden came back he got his breath and then he was joking he couldn't get his breath the was live are you going to pass out and maybe die I don't

to New York Yankee team back your last year round the in the gym he played a team and and they mocked him every every play they go up to bat they played the hallelujah chorus music they've shown on the scoreboard crying when he cried when he lost Alabama in a\nIn a in a playoff game I guess and he also the issue of the river dog gives people will revert to black patches and the\nGuy jumping over him you know mocking John three sixteen the bottle the what happened later in that year people last like two or three of those games I Believe the later in the year when the big team was when they were winning three games to two or whatever all of a sudden they lost a third game and before the game and the Astros win in instead of them and so God remembers you up and that was\nWe'll keep it

I found the study and I was looking at it and um I again I I can\nTell you as a researcher there are a lot of pitfalls associate with meta analyses you got to be very very careful when you're doing those kinds of studies and when you are interpreting the findings from those studies you got to look\nFor the biopsies there's selection bias that can happen in a information biased of different forms of information biased selection bias can happen\nI just got to be very careful us all say about the accent and we get to technical a\nVitamin D three should not stop taking your vitamin D that this new study says that\nUh it doesn't help with bone health ... really I I I'm not so I'm not persuaded ... so what what do you have to say further about it\n[noise] [noise] Mm [noise] well uh supplementing does not predict vitamin D level when you have to look at other factors such as absorption or you're taking a with a meal containing fat or the the form\nYou're taking and the measurement you're taking because uh\nYou know that can affect that if they're doing blood levels which in most cases there they were not\nSo they're they're really not screening all the variable ... if ... if you have a very low vitamin D level and you take a four hundred units capsule for example you would not expect to budge your level very quickly\nAnd you would still be very low for a long time because you're taking a maintenance does but you're maintaining a low\nLevel so you know knowing that does is important knowing the blood levels and\nKnowing how it affects the doses important I have a study showing it takes a thousands of international units to start moving if you look at a cafe or a curve graph and trying to rapidly raised vitamin D levels you need five to ten thousand units typically are higher to start\nBudgeting it up very sharply instead of very low in gradually so what's the duration of the study how much were they giving that they look at dietary intake that they look at blood levels which are really the most important\nThing to predict how much vitamin D you have not supplementation\nEight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five eight seven seven eight nine seven talk ... ... ... I was just involved in the past week\nOr doing a lot of work on a bias in research selection bias and information buys those two major categories and so this was at the top of my mind them\nKind you brought it up in your chance at least share a couple of thoughts about this notion of\nA science ... these studies all kinds of studies whether it's a randomized control trial whether it's a case study a cohort study a case control study um any kind of epidemiological study or you're always worry about by it or are\nYou worried about how the sample was drawn you worry about the assignment of people into groups you worry about ... the way things are being measured in the study ... there's so many opportunities for bias due to enter into the picture\nIt up so I'm just saying ... ...\n... you know science just because of the study was done doesn't mean that it's the end all be all and it was it's bulletproof\n... not not it's done by humans that makes it that's what the um the the issue so I ...\nThe ... part of it is up by us though of of training because or ignorance really because if they don't understand that the ... levels are more important than supplementation if they don't understand the supplementation is not the only way you're getting vitamin D\nAnd they are looking at studies with that view point they've got blinders on they don't understand the topic they're not competent to design a study yet here they are with the study that's getting international news\nAbsolutely eight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five eight Seventy seven eight nine seven talk or at now foods um okay so what do you have to offer ... ... in your repertoire on vitamin D for the consumer\n... who me yeah [laughter] yeah you\nKnow we we have a lot of vitamin D and vitamin D products are actually in our top ten sellers out of Fifteen hundred products in our selection wow that's how good these are uh we've got vitamin D ... v inform\nWe've got the vitamin D three which is from Atlanta Lynn typically which is a a sheep\nWool grief they out of the oil and will Mm Lindy removed\nWhen they make yarn and things and they convert that into vitamin D mimicking what happens when sunlight hits our skin and turns cholesterol into vitamin D\nAnd ... ... ...\nSo they simply shine light on this and and create vitamin D\nRight um so you got your ... you got to be getting form and then you have a ... a let me ask you the\nMost mostly it's been on big informs though and we have everything from powders should liquid drops baby baby formula is even I'm\nA ...\n... al tablets capsule and you can get strength anywhere up to ten thousand units which is really a level you use if you're trying to boost fairly quickly and the lowest one would be four hundred units which is the old RDA which has been raised to six hundred\nA ... what about the student athlete what kind of vitamin D to the student athlete pocket need to do you take a\n... he had a question about that yeah because I I work with you know the the uh young football players the like the little league football team and should they be taking vitamin D [noise]\nYeah and I'm usually I'd recommend taking vitamin D is part of a multivitamin just get all the basics so many of us an estimated twenty to twenty five percent of uh\nIran special diet whether we're dieting for weight whether we're we

to my again which I don't know that we can quantify if anyone would um\nIn fact having brown rice having a whole grain would actually be preferred unless you have a reason um and hopefully a medical reason not to\nTo have that so we were in unless indicated otherwise I Would say people should have their whole grains I'm so I Would prefer that people would eat their brown rice over their white

look at ... if you'd want to look this up and look at it like many fad diets it is restrictive in nature and so there are many foods that are eliminated and so when you start eliminating many foods\nThe likelihood of someone losing weight is you know ... is probable and unlikely to happen and oftentimes when people lose weight and their their body respond differently they do feel better or so\nThat said a lot of the foods that are suggested that be eliminated in this election free diet are very healthy nutritious food than actually our foods that\nMayo Clinic radio I'm Dr Tom shards I'm tracing upgrade poly cystic kidney disease or ... is an inherited disorder where clusters of this developed within the kidney [noise] it's it's caused it needs to enlarge and lose function over time\nNow the chips are benign that is their non cancerous or their their shocks they're thrilled with clue it ... it can also causes to develop and other parts of your body mainly deliver\nThe disease can cause serious complications as well including high blood pressure and kidney failure the FDA recently approved the drug tone of opt in to come up to talk to and who it's for patients with poly cystic kidney disease\nMale clinic was instrumental and the research for this drug and will be one of the only a few places to initially off of the treatment is part of its clinical practice and here to discuss as male clinic enough Raul adjust Dr fraud should be welcome to the program Dr ...\nThank you for having me doctors should be great to have you here and it sounds like a real advance of poor people who have publicity kidney disease absolutely tell us a little bit about the condition itself so votes the kid didn't use 'em there's two types there's one which was called up to going to censor and the other one to go to someone dominant\nAnd that report to the inheritance pattern refers to the inheritance or the first one that excessive\nUh suited affect the ... the children and then the kidney failure and from a liberal issues as well but the most common type which we will talk more about the auto normal dominant which affects mostly the adults are the most common inherited kidney disease and as you mentioned\nSo these patients actually are born with some food food to act\nA so called good but they don't cause any major issues\nOr early on uh mostly high blood pressure hypertension sometimes they can call them bleeding and then later on or needs to grow and kind of a damaged the kidney\nAnd you can you created or show one kind that the ... the one that probably less common can affect you as a child and the more common type a will affect you as an adult but they're both called poly cystic and to see this is actually\nHow common common dominant as I mentioned the most common so it's one in five hundred to one and a thousand in the population\nSo there is about two hundred thousand patients with ... or a deeply Katie those normal dominant type in the United states and about twelve Thirteen million worldwide and\nWhat happens if patients aren't treated I mean if it starts off shut wrecking your kidneys and then what happens\nYeah so for decades the patient to uh have a family history so they've seen their great grandparents their parents going through uh the the disease they've never imagined that they are the kind of something to slow down the disease progression or the suits from growing\nSo for many decades the only thing would be treating high blood pressure making sure you're healthy and then once you reach the end stage renal disease where you need either die outdoor transplantation\nAnd that's usually the the treatment so there was no treatment basically and for the bus to the kid and a half about Fifteen Years or so here at Mayo Clinic of tourists in his lab attentive towards kind of found what the basis of ah the sits from uh the troops to the to be growing and feeling good with fluids\nOr and found that if we target are the duty softer so that to the doctor that the first hormone act upon on the kidney\nIf you block that receptor venue lead to lower what we call black to get these with a molecule that drives before the tries to for a than growing and finished with it so he found if we block that then we can slow down to the progression\nAnd then we we took that over to clinical trials and then found that the the medication that would slow down to disease progression\nTo it's not a cure but it slowed down a disease of from so it's kind of relate the need for a kidney transplant or the attitude that earlier age and hopefully the game more years of good kidney function with the treatment\nEven more than what previously would have been a line of treatment which would be try to control your high blood pressure still do that but this medication now can push off any potential problems years decades what\nSo yeah so treating high blood pressure it's very very important for these patients and there has been some clinical trials that did not show that it's going to be late too much the progression so we need some kind of treatment that would really slow down\nSo told often is the first a frequent for this disease uh so usually the best it's starting to patients on these are on the medication\nYoung so when the kidney function of the normal but there can you start to making the set so if we started early on they have to be on it for several years for decades probably twenty twenty Thirty years and they would gain hopefully\nSeveral years back and usually we say if someone is progressing fast usually every four years of treatment or with today the the need for it out to buy one year\nOr so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years or there's not a big a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that means many years to study but so far it's gone up the expectation that's how it's gonna it's gonna believe this\nIs where our fantastic [laughter] so how do most patients find out that they have this disease and if you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history\n[noise] ah so mostly the majority of the patients will have someone in the family that has the disease and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnosed by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see that's it exactly so we look at the can use with you that sets and we have kind of criteria is and how many ... and depending on the age 'cause the older you are the more that you would have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by ultrasound and then we can do a C. D. scan or him or not to look more at that kind of the the kidney to and how big is the kidney and then we can um\nGive the prognosis or how the patient would do depending on how big the troops are\nAnd at the Beijing wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and see\nYeah there's about five to ten percent of the patients that don't have a family history so that could be either a new patient so new defect in the gene that just happened in these patients and usually the first sign of either high blood pressure or they get some kind of bleeding from the ... so they see blood and urine and they get pain and the ... and they're back\nOr a sometimes an infection indecent and they get a fever and then the pain and then uh they get to imaging and that you are probably and then they got to got scan or some kind of image and their TV sets and they diagnosed him do high blood pressure or blood in the yard for uh\nPeople who have poly cystic kidney disease or there's a whole family history and um what is the take away one of those patients need to know\nSo it's really an exciting news for all these patients for example yesterday I offered the treatment for one of the patients who ... who kind of told me that story that even in the Eighteen hundreds\nThey know that they had some kind of ... or some kind of can you eat and actually when she knew that there's an FDA approved drug she started crying actually for several minutes it was very exciting so for these patients first they need to make sure that they're getting good health care so\nUh in terms of blood pressure and then see if they are eligible for the medication\nOr so not all the patients would need to be treated in fact some are slow progress or so\nThere sits are small enough and small number that they don't need to be on any treatment except just being healthy and ... of treat the blood pressure but some patients would progressed very fast and they wouldn't need a they ought to be in their forties fifties and these patients would benefit most from the treatment\nSo it's important for these patients will be checked\nTo know where they kind of are are they slower fast progressing and then uh probably screen their kids as well now that there's a treatment we're recommending that we checked for for the seeds because there's something to do about it in a drug widely available\nVery and you just got approved in may there's many logistics around this medication it's regulated by the FDA and we need a lot of luck that thing every month for the first year and a half it ...\nIt's kind of expensive drugs so probably at some new and how the insurance would cover and so forth but we were working with all the patients who are asking about it and we're kind of\nUh doing something where new to kind of a sudden these patients come to their uh can you doctors be checked and also check their kids and what's next in the research\nA lot of things are exciting actually at me so we have well great may be kidney center\nAnd we do a lot of translation research in a way that we do a research in the lab and try to translate that to the patience to to get new treatment so we have a new targets actually we're very excited about and a couple of drugs or medications that could be effective so hopefully that would be the next the good treatment for it became the\nUh to help not only slow down the tool for the cure the disease and not have any patient meeting the office of president\nWell that would be fabulous what is the new drug is called the ... and our guest Mayo Clinic up our luggage kidney specialists out to pull\nOut he should be should be an extreme weather thank you for this but I think

a lot of different aspects to estate planning since I'm not an attorney and I'm not talking about actual construction of documents what I Do want to do is I Want to take this kind of financial advisory lens out so to speak\nAnd essentially look at maybe five potential areas of conflict in how to avoid them when it comes to a state planning so the first one is unintended negative tax consequences for beneficiaries interests you see sometimes when we have assets that pass on to somebody else and our family\nThat actually changes their impacts the taxation of those assets and how they received them so one of the things that you want to try to make sure that you do is pass that on in a way that's nuts\nActually creating tax consequences that maybe they were unaware of it that could potentially be harmful for them\nIn the first place we talked about this which just in the estate tax and we were mentioning how you know you can be a discrepancy between the federal estate tax exemption in the in our case Illinois or whatever the state tax exemption is that you live and\nAnd that's one of those kind of quote unquote gotcha is that sometimes people don't realize from a planet standpoint you know once you total all of the court and vegetable assets that you have\nBut then add in some of the uh additional collectibles and stuff like that as well as property whether it's the second Homer occasion homes and then sometimes even life insurance it's very easy for people who are looking at themselves saying why only have to\nYou know maybe a couple of million dollars in festival assets but then when you add everything in now there are over that steak tattoo Simpson and create in his shoes potentially for people that are going to have to settled out of state the other issue\nWhere I think there can be some problems from attack standpoint is when you're looking at pre tax accounts and and this is one that I think people sometimes things through but haven't really realize the ... of what it means and here's the idea\nTo the degree that I have any pre tax accounts I raised for one k.'s world three ... whatever it might be I got to remember that that money has never been taxed before I had the ability to contribute that money on her pre tax basis basically meaning that I excluded from income in the year that I made the contribution\nAnd all along the while it's been growing tax deferred\nNow the government didn't let me do that simply because you know their magnanimous and just wanted to give me a break they did it basically to help encourage me to be able to save for retirement but also because they knew at some point they're going to be able to tax that large or something\nSo what ends up happening is you're not familiar with a requirement um distribution rules is that when an individual who has a pre tax account turned Seventy and a half\nThan there actually required to start pulling a minimum amount of income out of these various retirement account and that's strictly so that that amount of money now become subject to taxation it increases are adjusted gross income\nNow if I have a four one K. planner let's say that my dad had a four one K. plan\nAnd he passed on and just use rough numbers let's say that you know he had half a million dollars in this four one K. plan he passes on and he was over the age of Seventy and a half\nInside the probate court and appropriate court is the one who's going to make sure that the well is is enforced and and there's a certain protocol that they then have to follow to be able to make sure that it's done in a fair way for everybody\nSo the first thing that we all want you to know is that uh will may not be sufficient for what you're intending to do and that's not for me to say whether or not you need a will or whether you should have a trust or or what you want to do just know that based on what your intentions are will may not be the best documents for you but it kinda goes a step further\nIf you think about who people typically name and their will and I'm not talking about you know who they name as guardians of their children or take care of their pets and stuff like that\nBut if they're trying to disseminate assets through our will and they're trying to leave let's say property or accounts or something like that to somebody else who typically gets named as a beneficiary or an air\nWell it's often someone who has a very close relationship with the C ... like a child or a family member or a very close friend because they're being named the beneficiary or as an error because the the seed and wants to help them wants to benefit them wants to bless them with something\nSo you're typically leaving this asset leaving this money to someone who you care about and who you are have a vested interest and\nSo it goes to read them that this isn't done intentionally hurt anyone\nNow one of the things that I think can happen\nThe inadvertent release of privileged were protected information and it's very simple and I'm not saying that this is happening rapidly and not trying to call the panic or tell people that there is a problem but in this day and age I think that people are getting more and more sophisticated\nWith respect to schemes that are being run to be able to\nTrick people into giving up information or to take over accounts or do identity theft or whatever it might be I remember a story I was actually talking to a client\nAnd his clients family owns a business\nAnd they're actually telling me how they were almost the victim of identity theft of fraud essentially and it was not super sophisticated as you know it's not like James Bond came in and and did some super spies stuffing hacked to them but it was a certain level of sophistication and what ended up happening\nWas they basically somehow got access to one of the employees email account\nIn rather than just acting right away they waited\nThey read the emails they actually learned who was who inside the company they learn some of the an accurate they learn how they talk to each other and then based on all that information they started sending money trying to get people to wire somebody in the accounting department\nOf basically getting them to wire funds to this account that they had set up and I say that because I think that as technology kind of increases and ask things become more sophisticated\nPeople can do a lot more with a little bit of information\nSo why am I talking about this and and again for those of you that are just joining outside of this whole morning we've been really just talking about a state planning on doing it more from a transfer advisory standpoint old from a practical can textural standpoint of things that people never think about when it comes to a state planning but\nYou know this is just too important I think sometimes to let it go and in fact you know if you have any questions about any of the stuff that we're talking about you know feel free to call us at uh eight\nFor for three four five three one for zero we always set aside a little bit of time to be able to try to provide some quick information to our listeners so as we're talking through this stuff anything pops up you know please don't hesitate to give us a call and we'll do our best to kind of point in the right direction and help you out\nBut here's what I Want you to consider with respect to will is also\nIf I were somebody and I wanted to steal somebody's identity or let's say that I wasn't going to go full identity theft but I just wanted to maybe open a credit card in somebody's name have you ever thought about what information they may want\nOr what information may be useful for them to start to go down this process\nWell if you think about it is very simple stuff you know they probably want to know your name your address or they probably want to know if they can your Social Security number and if you think about security questions you know if you're going onto an online site that usually ask you things like what town did you grow up and or you know what was your\nDog when you were growing up or what high school did you go to what was your mother's maiden name you know stuff like that\nWell now let's think about what information is usually included in a will\nTypically it's going to say based off of who the beneficiaries are it's going to say you're full legal name is going to say your current address it's going to identify your relationship to the test state or the person who's leaving the asset to\nOftentimes it's going to have at least you're partial Social Security number so maybe just the last four digits if it's a home or a property that's being decreased is going to talk about the property and where it's located\nIf it was your mother that was leaving this to you it could include your mother's maiden name is ... ...\nIf you have joined airs like brothers and sisters it could include their names and if your parents or whoever is leaving this to you\nLived in the area where you grew up it could include the state of birth or where you're potentially lip that's different that's different points eight different pieces of privileged information that could all be exposed to will and the problem that you have is that uh will is a public document\nSo literally you know if whatever county you live and you can go down to the county's office and actually look up will you can pool a lot of the information and people will say well you know why wouldn't the government or why wouldn't the county protect the information in a sense they just may not be able to whatever is in the well the wheels a public document and it has to be public\nSo that a potential creditors or potential people who feel like they have a claim against the state have the ability to protest the information that's in the will\nTo all of that is in a will and so what this means is that sometimes just by accident\nYou might be actually releasing privileged information for the very people that you're trying to benefit\nAnd I don't think people do it intentionally you know I don't think anybody would do that to somebody that they want to benefit by leaving them some asset but simply just not by knowing how will will functions and the fact that it's a public document and that has kept on file typically at the county office\nThat you may inadvertently be creating these issues now people say okay if I'm not going to have a will then what do I use and it's not for me to\nBut just do everybody the courtesy of sitting down and kind of explaining to them in this case especially the oldest son what you're doing and while you're doing it that way they know it's not a surprise to them and they're not wondering you know why you don't love them\n[laughter] and you ... you know it sounds funny because people think well you know obviously people know that I Love them but they don't they don't always know you know the other piece is then uh you know becoming a financial burden or not becoming a financial burden when I talk to people and\nI started to inquire about you know what their goals are with estate planning a retirement plan or whatever it is\nYou know to the degree that people have either experienced it or or thought about it one of the things that often comes out is that they don't want to be a financial burden on somebody else you know either they you've been a caregiver for somebody else and they they know what it's like\nYou know the pressure and anxiety a created on them and they're thinking well gee I don't want or want to do that to to somebody else I don't want my sister and my brother or\nOr my kids are my grandkids have to take care of me you know I Want to take care of them so one of the things that you often want to think about is what causes people to become a financial burden\nAnd this is where the whole retirement planning really intertwined with the state planning\nPoor retirement planning that causes people to basically run out of assets or or you know fall victim to poor market timing is what can often cause people to be financial burdens\nIn a lot of the different weeks on the show we talked about some of the risks to retirement planning but the biggest one to kind of leave you with\nIs that you have to always remember that when you're trying to figure out how much income you can take out of your investments you can't simply rely on radar return and there's a lot of different math mental processes that go into it you know if I have\nHalf a million dollars and I'm averaging you know ... percent rate of return that means that I'm basically a increasing by twenty five thousand per year I Can't just say well I'm going to take twenty thousand per year and I should be fine because I'm actually going to grow my investments with an additional five thousand a year\nThe truth is that I can be averaging that five percent per year on paper but actually based off of how I'm taking the money out of the account be pulling so much principle that I'm actually depleting the account you know we call this the flaws of averages and\nHere's a quick example you know I often tell people if I had to investments one that average twenty five percent per year and one that average five percent per year which one do you want and it's probably no surprise that everybody raises their hand and said oh I'll take the twenty five percent per year but then you actually do the math so let's say that I had\nInvestment and it went up a hundred percent but then it fell fifty percent well over the two year period that's uh net fifty percent gain\nDivided by two years that's a twenty five percent average rate of return but if you do the math let's say I had a hundred thousand dollars and I go up a hundred percent will nominate two hundred thousand but then I fall fifty percent now I'm back to a hundred thousand on paper I average twenty five percent per year but in real life I didn't make a dime\nNow to make the situation worse look to assume that I thought that because I was averaging twenty five percent per year that I could withdraw call at ten or twenty thousand per year out of this account and now you can see how people quickly can start eroding the principal not even realizing that they're doing it\nAnd when that happened over a prolonged period of time\nPeople can become really nervous you know they can go from having half a million dollars down to four hundred to two hundred and then health care starts to creep up\nAnd now they're scared that they're going to run out of money and so they are leaning more on friends and family to help them out and they put themselves in a situation where they become that financial burden\nThat they didn't want to do and I think that's one of the reasons why we're so passionate about helping people try to think through this retirement planning an estate planning scenarios because it's often the things that people never knew about it and if they had just snowed\nAnd then they could have done something differently that would have put them in a different situation so\nNo that's all the time that we have for today and I don't know where the time and but tune in next week and we're going to keep talking about\nThis retirement planning and income planning scenarios [noise] so have a great weekend we'll talk to you later [noise] that's all the time we have for today thanks for listening for more information about today show host or to

Pete Rudolf a there's a lot of different people out there who are have come around to this theory and I and and I and then you say it and I've said it for years which is\nPlants on their own mulch if you put them close enough to get to see people are afraid that if you put plants to close together all you get is pests and diseases what's wrong with that thinking\nWell if you put a kind of tough structural plant that are involved in a while to kind of grow far apart really close together that is absolutely true I'm eating you know what she put 'em for example of something like an upright switchgrass panic I'm\nChiquita cetera like a lot of people in my profession do and that is a plant that in the wild gross several feet apart kind of a solitary plant in so that you know big massing of panic I'm like five hundred to ... that are ... where you often get roster other fungal diseases\nBut we're actually suggesting as you keep those kind of larger upper layer stuck to keep it can keep some distance between some of those\nBut twelve to Fifteen and just kind of underneath the upright plant\nUsing a lot of eight inch tall a Fifteen inch tall lower plant around the base this plant so we're getting ... at the same time you're getting air circulation\nIn some ways it's kind of in birding the pyramid of traditional landscaping we take these kind of big structural plant 'em in and kind of either space in mulch or my profession since ... tied together still with most underneath them\nAnd then they they do get all the while they do that we're we're kind of taking this after layer plant and spacing them in the way they would grow in the wild you know at least three or four feet apart\nAnd then but having two or three layers of mid height or or ground hugging\nPlant kind of underneath and that way you kind of get the best of both worlds to get the best of you know the plants that grow on the ground layer these are ... too high humidity high shape pressure\nOn summer drought um you know that they can handle the stress is\nNot a taller plan like a ... or or um you know a ... would do so great\nFeet apart\nYeah you know growing into one another you you\nMentioned earlier somewhere in there about minority being sluggish I have yet in my twenty five to Thirty years of gardening seen that but I ... okay I'll take your word for it I I think minority of the reason I'm an artist is not selfish is because it's so easy to remove\nYou just kind of money then you put is true it's you know the root system in order to OJ downhill\nBut right now that's a great point I I think you know like I'm an artist did a mother a is a little more ... spreads the little bit more but um yeah just to close the or there's a wonderful uh eastern the ball in order to buy a daring you know that's not an off I guess ... ...\nYou know you can get there's wonderful examples of all they're\nAll right by the way ... I got a couple of things I Want to get to before I Do want to remind folks that if they want to get a hold of Thomas rangers writings are best place to go is to fight to studio dot com P. H. Y. T. O. studio dot com fight studio dot com\nUm he's also the author with Claudia west a of a twenty Fifteen book called planting in a post wild world I remember when that came out and they did not get a copy I ... I had other things going on and and it and it kind of showed up on my radar and then uh now he makes me want to go back and get a copy of that\nOh yeah he's a you know that's I think that's really interesting okay Joe is the perfect example he's got weeds in his vegetable garden now yeah to some degree they will\nUh but they're controlled we consume nutrients but\nHe also doesn't freak out about them he lets them grow there\nAnd he says yeah there there are looked at my look at my vegetables are still doing grad that low level I'm a ... layer yeah and and to some degree those that low level of vegetation if it's weeds is a mulch [laughter] this is what we're talking about before when in when everybody goes\nI yeah I've seen this cause I've actually done this so I'm I I Will cop to it\nOr putting down mulch\nWhere you put it down long enough in a dries out and it's like a a a a four inch three four inch layer that's like a plywood\nI mean it's just yeah just as you could you dig it and it comes out in these huge chunks\nWell that's not helping anything no water getting through that that's not that's not gardening that's that's a painting that's ... yeah it is I was going to say it's home improvement or something it's run county old thing\nSo um that's a ... or you could do like Ron ... does at the end of each season which he just knows everything you know it down in a way\nThat's exactly right I mean and leave the roots in the ground he's [laughter]\nAnd you know I I wouldn't advise is I wouldn't put it in a book\nA except to say as an example of how some people do it but in a sense what runs doing is right he's taking the vegetation is returning to the earth he's\nHe's allowing it to break down these allowing the microbes to get in there he's allowing the the nutrients in the plants that were there to go back into the ground which is why they come back which is why he's overrun with strawberries\nThe marshals strawberries that we gave him in like three little pot um four or five years ago and now he can't get rid of them are going in a sense that that's really the ... so\nI was gonna say there's two things that we've been brainwashed on one is pesticides and that everybody needs to have a a bug killer or a plant killer for their yard I Would say Ninety five Ninety nine percent of you don't ever need to use that I'm Sorry that then that sounds like I'm being over the top but I don't think I Am because I've had other\nCultures degree of me to kind of not and they say I wouldn't say it in public but you know on the radio guy so I said in public uh\nMost of the time you don't need that stuff alright yeah every now and then\nYou know you might need round up to kill some poison ivy that's one in particular that I can think of um and there are other pernicious plants that will take over your yard and yeah and the ideas use it wants them than ever used yet if you're smart you are going to say some of these are\nGoing to hit some of what we've been brainwashed and also um what you lead into the segment with it's also maybe the first year or two you're putting more amendments\nAnd you're doing more things to establishments that then people don't stop they don't change the pattern they don't change the behavior so into the garden has matured and and and the bad had filled in\nStill doing what they were doing and I'll say already be Arabic example of that is um again with something Thomas was talking about is like using plants as your mulch to suppress weeds um if you ... yeah if you put a a plant on square\nOr is that what they call it a every you know\nTwo feet you're going to have all these open space and you know what's going to happen weed seeds are going to come in and they're going to they're going to establish you might be matching so you'll not all years yeah but the ... ... as you were saying what folks do is they go oh that works so I'll just continue to ... year after year ... know what you do then is bringing more plants\nAnd you fill in those gaps not with the mouse you filament new plants until you've got all plants and not\nAgain as Tom said don't put the panic room altogether in clumps because that's not the way it grew in nature\nSo what this requires is you've got to do a little homework you got to do a little research you've got to either talked to a well first of all go on line go to a good uh educational site like Illinois extension or the expansion in in\nYour neck of the woods where there was a plant find or there's some great ones out there I'm a Michigan State has a really good one or what's going to a store and I can remember a but a lot of extension services are are really really good and you do some research and then you find that out and ... and then\nUm and then you read\nBooks like he is about ... Roy did what I meant yeah for yeah and and that's how you do a and\nOne of the articles and I can't recall which one was pointing out even for shade so in sun you might be using such as another little coverage but in shade um the well genders and the Chileans and several other things that are Jews and the judges and thinking about such as as you get um almost any what replacing the Pakistan birds and the other you know like I Am not\nA fan of package Sandra ah I like how to you in modern ...\nIn place like that yeah Google native if you possibly can okay ... thanks to Thomas rain or for being of the show landscape architect future public speaker and heritage\nInnovator innovative yep that's that's that's what I meant in ... that's what I was trying to ...

couldn't tell [laughter] so I took that also get you probably don't bother re but if you do you'll hear like I figure if they they did this for fifty years and sometimes broke up while they were doing it we could do that too\nAnd that's what happens with the audience hears that we're having fun hopefully there will be listening as well um the look at what we did that come from the barbecue guy and the and the fun too I think\nYou were just you were brand thing about something\nI think it would just ranting as Doug about cooking or barbecuing something and so it was just totally innocent and\nYou know I kinda like that ran in your voice took on a different tone and attitude and and I think that's where the barbecue guy gr I said that the good characters someone that comes on and talks about cooking about barbecuing and\nYou just took it and you ran with it it was great\nYeah I got permission to do it or almost you know like basically right is you need to get you need to get through all of a wall of self consciousness when you're doing improbable you're doing that kinda\nThing and and and not try to be funny that's another thing I you know like rush 'cause a lot of time to go over to try to before and it just never works that way I don't know if it's funny not say but I don't we don't go full joke so punch lines\nOf ... that was when we did our half hour show in the beginning and we really just trying to feel out what what's up for you to give you the permission to do it and go along as a\nStraight person the first time was just barbecue guy\nAnd then we went to a after that funding for fun to do which is more or less an odd couple I suggested to do that yeah that would not re let's hear a little of now fondue guy imitating barbecue guy\nI ... I'm going to read it like barbecue guy now and for the ... don't forget the skill you understand the scale is I'm Talking about scale was here you got to roll the scale and I wrote it was a guy yeah you got\nTo write but from ripe mutt from mutt from\nBananas ripe for either going to have you like the fondue guy let's see what the fun to go respond to\nTake it back up [laughter] I Know I Know\nThey could bag marshmallows marshmallow and they'll have a headache and you basically put her on the floor you stomp on it with both feet throw it out of barbecue and there you go that doesn't sound that does not sound very appetizing to me I'd like to have a glass of wine some ...\nAnd a little fun though and that's all I Would like can I\nTell you that is the most intelligent statement I've ever heard you've\nRead but I like the ... the barbecue guy has still kept his accent or irritating\nAnd on took us a blackout so not many people can do it the way you do it I Know\nAnd I just said you know what let's break it up because you were supposed to scheduled in that show just to read that\n... you know sort of however and it's too dry and it's just\nOne of the radio let's have some fun there is some power behind not seeing the voices\nAnd again we're not trying to dies disguise the voices but to put different accents and turns to it I think it's pretty fun uh we did that once we we experimented there's another just came out of nowhere we were doing a show on a big uh be after the\nBig friendly giant right and we're talking about getting big in getting small different movies or do that kind of stuff to different movies and shows and so we just rift into first David getting really small and then I got really big\nIf you're ... ... ... ... ... [laughter] you sound like the flights and like a David his way\nAll right All right ... have you back on this is horrible for you it really is horrible for everyone listening is now can you walk around or will you be stepping on the idea to step\nIn the pool a little while but now I probably won't vote for now [laughter]\nThe technology we used to create the large person in the small person it's just it's unprecedented\nGet pretty much put we put out like I don't know a hands or a mouse I think is what we yeah [laughter] and then a little better there but but again ... hopefully are enjoying it if you're not let us know but this was\nJust explaining to use some times the thought behind why we uh we do this and we were doing like the lack of thought we were doing a New Year's show we wanted to say we're at\nNew Years you know in times square this is another one coming out of the different one now different time when we were in New York Times square and we were going down\nTo a a reporter Johnny Jones on the spot on the spot reporter and he was interviewing one of the people waiting for the bolts of\nHow to handle a female voice Bob and ray that female voices and have a six hours is a reason\nI Want to say\nWhat is your brings Ali this is the problem\nOf girls they didn't actually I think it might get you some of the trouble on the radio I don't\nI've been there and wait for the last twelve hours and we've become very good for like\nA ghost so we're actually not in times square I'm sure that's pretty obvious wow I thought we were [laughter] and then later on in the same show we we uh ... if you didn't redo this 'cause I don't know if everyone got\nUh five have though if you're up for it I think to think of as well as a bird flu [laughter]\nIt it uh I don't feel like they're really old is doing and we're exploring our own characters are trying to explain to you the listening audience what's going\nOn and that was Sherlock Holmes and then Watson if you if it wasn't clear\nThey do have a favorite or if they've been on about five times I Would say\nYes has it been that many means like a lot more but only five it's\nAll right and they seem to um [noise] they they seem to play off each other pretty well they're starting now to get a little bit of homes is getting a little bit perturbed now I should say watching is at home is getting all the accolades solving mysteries and\nStealing a CIA stealing is a homes or solve some of the puzzle and I'm Sorry what and solve the puzzle and homes take the credit\nRight exactly and that was a little bit of a little side or about you know we just went off I don't know where it came from nowhere about the the fetching girl that ah the movies I was in the show about the detectives he had homes and watch and evaluating who is the successor to homes and Watson in our popular culture today\nAnd it took a took a turn [laughter]\nAnd then we had a Halloween show we've got some other characters just some repeating characters we've got a number of times and we've had a a bad Dracula David Cohen doing Dracula this time Al Capone and you know the dog ... this is what I get\nAnd my friend\nFor slowing the box and like what I really enjoy those demanding was what does he likes he wants to sugar babies or is he wants to pop rocks that guy he prefers human flesh but I think he'll go for the ... All right so it all started for ... hours as he keeps her mouth\nOccupy that you could see All right that's what I thought how about you know Al Capone looks like out can be sure that\nChubby guy with a that's a good hour that occupy I'll go to the party well no I Am now compound which I should I use the microphone everyone came to be confused with the microphone no that that's Al Capone I Am out 'cause I don't\nSmoke like this all the time as well\nJust because history present at a certain way doesn't reflect reality right so I guess so yeah I I just figured you'd be like a rough and ready to kind of a kind of I Am rough and ready\nWho is this actually Hi my name is Leonardo\nDa Vinci oh I should have gotten it from that you know from the from the get out the costume that's great thank\nYou thank you I did that saturated David I'm not familiar you know it's funny because you sound like Al Capone would sound item alcohol would like to Saturday but I Know we like to steal the sites I didn't get that voice coming out of Leonardo da Vinci but it's great to have an area that we have a selection of a modern day for you and I and the way I see it looks like a nice friend looks like the last ...\nSelf promoting son of a gun and stuff in the middle of his works of art [laughter] who knew even though that you're marketing do you\nThink about it part of the world the that even now but back then had to be self promotion to get yourself out there right and so he must have been promoted himself left that are like oh why is it wouldn't know think about it or do what works the ads\nIn his basement if he didn't go round the party's bragging about it [laughter] so we just went off with that or the Dracula\nAlka poll was good I liked that the the little turn on the Internet yeah we had some fun with with the radio and again just just trying to make something a little bit different or that you hear on the radio and it's not all the time we do these voices it's maybe once in\nA five or six shows something like that yeah it's not always the times it's not often [laughter] and ah and but hopefully you're enjoying it and now we had a little different take later on we had a the Invisible Man talking to Dracula when we did I think it was a Victorian of dangers\nAnd we paid ... ... and the universal monsters against I'm against the the Avengers themselves and they had some discussion others are different Dracula\nA select so I don't know if we recognize that we heard ... on the show previously I\nGo\nI said what what are the entity in the money out saying he has said they're blaming the Abbott and Costello fiasco ... Dracula loss the contest on their behalf and they've never gotten over that\nThey are here to ... album bloody I'd taken from me right and I thought you know I Love the trash talk by Dracula it's\nGreat [laughter] so uh I don't know if he was laughing at this stuff besides I was out at this insanity what goes on the size and there was Dracula which voices better\nWhich I like your voice is not the traditional Dracula which I was I was too much on the nose I than we can\nTalk about that now you said you know he said that you know that voice in Hollywood is not just like Al Capone said you know it's not like the reality though um I actually got a little glimpse of that uh when the Bob and ray did a\nInterviews with in time and they started interviewing\nA you know a character that different presidents Washington or whatever we don't know what their voices will like right so you could just do anything [laughter]\nAnyways and then we we stumbled upon we visited August one time and we stumbled upon a character of jak pumpkin had now along the same lines with the Halloween show he then broke in when we would have this party this Halloween party on the air and he was being chased and ...\nBut you should explain who pumpkin headed 'cause I don't think a lot of people with the character\nHe he's a character that is from the original book the wizard of Oz was in a couple of books there's a lot of books and a lot of it looks like he was a hero and we figured he's the only guy if you look at those to the old series he's left at odds\nWith all the other ones were presented in the movie itself the wizard of Oz he was not even mentioned it the wizard of Oz he was in some other movies that mentions him but he's a character became I said let's do something different with wizard of Oz everyone\nHas talked about the wizard of Oz agrees and all this so we actually visited there\nSo we went to you went back to the books and found this character they never made it into the you know the famous movie and I know I'd write what what would he be saying we gave him some air time\nWould be would be upsetting like there'll be very upset with the ... best of ah [laughter] you know we have like ... I'm left here and he's looking for work it's Seventy years and he said no work [laughter] and so now he's become a a mainstay in some ways uh to the show Neary is breaking in a two hour show on Halloween 'cause he was\nI like at the end of watching as suddenly queens accent [laughter] I mean I cannot get royalties\nListeners guide [laughter] he's anger brings out the Bronx and and I did it goes back to the bar and he goes back keeps I'll go back to the fact that that he did do some of the bar tab as large part\nRight yeah yeah that that that they're refusing to pay [laughter] um\nHe just gives them is is getting wider and wider\nPretty but I thought I think that the seat of the idea that spin on homes in watching that we've been doing which I think it's good is that where Sherlock Holmes with the declared the declaring I ever saw the ministry\nWhen obviously if you listen to it at the Watson who came up with this illusion and so he's just feeding him feeding the information they fly away exactly before watching can put together the conclusion\nHomes cuts right to the chase and claims claimed credit for it all\nRight let's just [laughter] which I think it it again you know back in the day how do you know that that it wasn't the fictional characters but how do you know that it wasn't a wife and really solving the problem of the mysteries homes just like a great you know rocket or of the ideas so [laughter]\nThat would that work and when you listen to the first time you've heard that back between the voices and I flipped here and there because I wanted to put things together and the conversation would spot for example came out of out of\nOrganically something else but could you tell a you could tell who the different voices none of the most current out an accent yeah ... was straight then you had the action is homes and then you had both actually you could tell those are different characters\nRight I think so so for the most part I think they all yeah ... you know pumpkin is obviously in homes or I'm watching a pretty distinct\nConsidering they were literally six character's talking and that in that scene right um that's tough to pull off in general so maybe way\nTo say that they're not going to do I hear what you know that a boy oh it's the barbecue guy and how in the fondue guy wait hold on to do all your please yeah\nTo a place a barbecue\nGuy we discuss this before I let me let me speak to them let me go ahead go ahead I'm a little upset guy and I understand that so does let's David to first of all apologies for the intrusion in your show\nYeah it's good to see though I don't know how you found a studio but okay a good to see you and fun to think well the Google is an amazing Thai okay we don't have a few minutes those ... what are you here for\nBarbecue guy was very upset over the fact that there apparently characters that you guys are doing that we're not really ...\nYeah there's a lot of characters that like to know why why is all this time you spent on these got homes and watching\nThese ... what is that what this pumpkin ahead what is this pumpkin had guy just victims you know the real the wizard of Oz is not even real why am I getting part of this it royalty at the very wide or I get some show time what's happening\nSo yes so the barbecue guy and and I concur with his thought a\nBunch of your car how do you like a car with does it listen guys were doing the best we can there's plenty of air time you don't have to worry about it we have you back you've been back for the best of\nShow how did you guys like ... ... ... what were you visiting I mean you could have texted as she could have like call but what\nI'll tell you that started to do what's his name there to find them and he wanted me to go ahead and text you will give you a call I said no nothing better than in person up close and personal do by the way it I'm going to the baseball field this ban is not here for you as bad as not here to intimidate you I have a bad here 'cause I'm going to replace them softball even though it's a November\nI can vouch for that because I also am on the team now I Try to get him to text um but he\nGot in fact I Want to know one thing here they've got no time we have no time for you find do okay it's not a chess match\nThe idea was this I Want to know why two guys that are dead for a hundred and fifty years getting more airtime than me and find though he's referring to Sherlock Holmes ...

[noise]\nPersonally I Want to talk about really quickly is a dog's way home opens on January ... eleven\nOr\nYou remember this designer homes supposed to be with\nLife we planted like when you move around but we don't mind [noise]\nWhere\nAre they very far but I don't know\nPlayed the waiting for me\nTo go and find this is sort of the sequel in spirit to dogs purpose that by the same guy who wrote the book the dog's purpose and and it's a story of a dog that gets lost it leaves home it gets sort of like an incredible journey story we've seen the movie before\nWhere the dogs left somewhere or escapes are ends up going away from home and have to find his family and you know everything from lack you come home to two Benji movies you we've seen these movies before but this is spinning off of the dogs perfect thing where you got the narrator that's the dog and it's a cute friendly family sort of middle America\nYou know has the country music soundtrack these sort of like a pop country music soundtrack that you hear in the background of the film this looks like it could be my biggest thing with the dogs purposes I like the dog story way more than I like the human story and I'm hoping that\nThis one focuses more of the dog because that's what I find interesting I don't care about donors nonsense garbage that he has to deal with\nSo this was kind of cute looking for that's something that might be fun in January the next one I Want to hit really quickly in Latin which opens on may twenty four\nThis is of course it's a very early teaser of it and the look in the film looks cool I mean I think that's\nCertainly going to visually benefits from the modern live action I actually live action in quotes because it's a lot of it TGI most of them within the trailer is all created in the computer but it is the live action version of a of a lab and we don't get to see the genie\nPlayed by Will Smith so the jury's still out on the weather Will Smith can pull this off\nI'm a I'm skeptical that it could be awful but it could also be like really fun and I think that if they\nKind of rain Will Smith any it could be a good thing as long as it's not like shark tale that is it for this segment I Need to go to a break when it come back I'm going to be looking back at the Halloween franchise [noise] as a whole before I die in two different view of the new Halloween [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy either data of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a

about making money better knock\nFor those who are changing gotten better teachers with your investment it helps you didn't like me go to college\nMy name is Charles in mind your debit and\nInvest in them and you went out on a minute but terrible thing to waste a lot of wonderful things about human at\nAT T O T H twelve Twenty one [noise]\nAnd welcome back to fat guy at the movies with Kevin car here we are [noise]\nTwo weeks before Halloween Halloween falls in the middle of the week so it's really only a week and a half until Halloween [noise]\nSo we only have one more weekend after that to really fully enjoy the Halloween spirit and go do the crazy stuff on friday and Saturday nights and then we have Halloween which hold on a Wednesday\nNight she kind of like it went Halloween falls in the middle of the week because that's one trick or treat it and it makes it a little more easy when Halloween falls on a friday it gets really messy you I have a son who's still trick or treat these ten\nBut I I like what it falls in the middle of the week because then you could enjoy suffered in the middle of the we we can get so busy and crazy and uh you know Halloween on a Saturday and so it's kind of a nightmare\nBut since we're going back to the Halloween movies and we're looking back at them because we have a new Halloween film it snows third movie title Halloween you had the original Halloween and Nineteen Seventy eight\nWith John Carpenter directing then you had the awful just truly terrible Rob Zombie remake in two thousand seven I think\nAnd now this was also caught Halloween it's the sequel to Halloween it gets a little confusing\nIt's sort of like how when they made a prequel to John carpenter's thing in two thousand eleven and they just called it the thing so they have the thing which is a prequel to but the thing it's just a dumb way of naming things at Hollywood but you know who knows [noise] and he was kind of want to look back at the Halloween franchise could a couple of years ago I went over to a friend's house\nAnd we've been tj watched all the friday the thirteenth movies all in one day then we did that a couple months later with Halloween and we did that with nightmare on elm street I Will say that while Halloween the original Halloween is my favorite\nFilm and it reminds me a little bit of when we did evil and moved it Blade Runner twenty forty nine you could tell he was being respectful to the original source\nI think if Ridley Scott head shots of labor under twenty forty nine you would have gotten a different film that would have broke with the tradition that he originally set up with the original Blade Runner [noise]\nNot that I think John Carpenter water wanted to direct it but if it were the same director or some other person who will try to do their own spin on it it would have been a worst movie this is David Gordon Green going back to the source and feeling good about it there's a lot of\nMoments in their whether their shots at our takes on other shots of the original movie either the counter four or five shots at I mean the way that was shot and something that happened how things were framed\nThat were direct call backs to either the original movie\nOr some of the other sequel there's a team like for example the kids are running around on trick or treating three kids come running by wearing\nThe Halloween masks from Halloween three seasons which you know the pumpkin the witch and the skeleton\nAnd that was kind of cool I mean it is they they they have a lot of those moments but they're not\nThey're not overplayed their subtle they don't pointed out to you have to know the film to recognize how it all fits together and for somebody like me who's seen a bunch of 'em a lot of time I caught a lot of those references for example when they do the opening title\nIt's a direct connection to the original title word had the pumpkin and it was looming in on the pumpkin and then in Halloween to the pumpkin breaks open and there's a school in there\nWell this one does something a little bit different with a Jack o lantern and the pumpkin that some of it's actually a little bit subtle but really kinda cool and of course we have to use it coming back and he pays homage to the slasher film of the late seventies and into the ...\nAnd that's important because Halloween started the slasher Craig that was the one two punch of Halloween and then Halloween did so well\nFriday the thirteenth came in and then suddenly they're off to the races and then the eighties or early eighties in the mid eighties in particular were filled with slasher movies by the time they re booted Halloween for the first time in Nineteen eighty eight flashes were on their way down\nBut this really fulfill that sort of a new style job for slasher films from the eighties\nAt the same time it's still a modern horror movie it it it's the blood of your score a year it's a little more violent it's a little more disturbing\nBut not so much that it becomes a travesty in itself which is what happened with Rob Zombie movie and and that's one of the things I enjoyed about it it knows exactly where it is and I've heard people complained to boost jumped skaters will you know what\nThe first movie was a bunch of junk scares that kind of what these movies are it doesn't over produce the special effects it does the shots that needs to do and it does a lot of these shots practically without\nDoing too much they don't know do all this digital trickery and and that sort of thing they don't just shoot the movie and and I appreciate that and you know there's some story elements that are maybe a little bit over written\nEspecially some of the best with even with Jamie Lee Curtis in our family and there are some things that are you know unpleasant and the film but it's a movie about a guy who killed people for kick in until you're going to get that\nAh it's not as good as the original but I'll tell you for the sequels I still love Halloween three for how goofy it is but\nThis was right up there in terms of a re boots its way better than the Rob zombies stuff and it's better than a lot of the sequel from the eighties and nineties so I'm going to have to say that the Halloween totally rocks well actually\nYou're listening to the fact that the movies with Kevin car let's talk really quickly about the oath while the government tries to get all citizens to sign a loyalty oath a Thanksgiving celebration erupted in violence for one family\nToday's intense wave coping triggered by the U.S out but it's something we're calling the patriots stuff but they are going to shift Adam ... signed a loyalty waiver how proud I play that ally for signing and then after that\nWas coming [noise]\nAnd that is so not a legal\nHoliday I\nKnew nothing about this movie when I saw it in fact the only thing I knew about others I seen the poster and and if you look at the poster it looked like some sort of like\nA functional family romantic comedy\nIt's not it doesn't let overtly political moving and and you need to know that going in it's directed and written by Ike Baron Holtz and he'd come out and said he was a guy from the Mindy project and he was in the neighbors movies have you come out and said he doesn't have direct response trumpet some are in and Trump as president and and and is definitely\nPlaying off of that so it comes with a political point of view\nBut that's not necessary I mean it's what it's about but that's not what the movie become here's the thing about the loyalty oath that people are supposed to find by the day after Thanksgiving and there's a department of homeland security that are in in ... and and here's the thing\nIs at one point about politics of Thanksgiving and look in a couple of weeks we're all going to feel this ourselves we're all going to go to banks giving dinner we're all going to interrupt into a big political argument or we're going to happen to the person they're yelling no politics a dinner\nBut what's more interesting about this movie is what happened after the big family fight is one of the authorities come in for something and how quickly it escalates\nAnd and why it escalate and challenges you if you can get past the politics of challenges you to think\nWhat would I Do in that situation what is too far when do they go too far when it's an overreaching what would you do and where would you draw the line and it's a good point ... I like I said it's overly political but\nI think of it this turns even if if if you agree with the politics of the movie find go in and look at it at that but if you disagree with the politics of the movie looking at and saying what if there was a loyalty oath for the guy that I didn't like\nAnd just sit there and say oh well heeled silver thing in the path all never do that that's not that's out of the realm of possibilities there's others seem to the movie where they show just\nNasty and it's on the streets when people to people and ... and and those are real things that happen you see I'm On Facebook can you see 'em spread through viral videos the very things that are being shown in this movie and and even though this department of homeland security parts doesn't exist\nYou can see where overreach can happen where things aren't handled properly and when you put somebody in a position of authority over somebody else they have a potential abuse their power and they may not be\n... why would anyone trust Facebook enough to put\nA Facebook powered microphone and video camera in their living room or kitchen I mean you just look at Facebook's history of lack of privacy they don't care anything about our security so the Web site Recode actually wrote that on their site I'm going to read it to you\nKnow data collected through Porto even called log dad or app usage data like the fact that you listen to spot a fight will be used to target users with ads on Facebook or\nA year right okay they say they wrote that because that's what they were told by Facebook executives are you

people that subscribed to your email and just about forty million but that's all and she saw him on a story\nAbout seeing if there's money out they're connected to you may\nOkay that was the tip of the day that we put out this past week it's actually a tip that were you refresh every year\nUh and that there are actually several different ways that you could have on claimed money and so this is money that that view or maybe it's a a security deposit a utility deposit whatever maybe money from a pension or old four one K. or whatever and they're you know and the government actually trying to find you\nWell wait wait wait we'll we'll we'll use that and I talk to you again so you've been a caller before\nA long time ago I got a long time listener but\nCalled them oh well thank you Jim I appreciate that pre shape that\nI listen to every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good I'm going to waste you either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should have minded my own business but you didn't I didn't\nUh I have an acquaintance too recently uh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a marriage when he was in the military in Europe okay uh\nAnd that was a little Nineteen Ninety eight she was born and they recently reconnected and people with his family are concerned ah so I thought I did that old easy buttons and just do a background search on her and see what I could put a\nNo avail I failed miserably\nOh man so you're going to wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years\nOld okay All right so she's Twenty years old and that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um you couldn't really find anything about her like on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a Facebook account that looked like it had ... origin or January twenty eight team\nOh but that's not very much of a\nYou know not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend more about her or are you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or what\nAll of the above okay uh she does have to put it for money or they're not rich by any means uh uh the the family just to spend a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nI'm sure and then all of a sudden you have kids coming out of the blue right and you're like okay\nI just the body standard all the fish\nWhen we'll hear a good friend I mean you're worried about right and you want to make somebody I was\nI was concerned in a rut least so ah I don't like she anybody get hurt\nA ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in a different sites but it didn't get a lot but I used to ... dot com yeah his book Google and I'm coming up with nothing\nYou know there is also family trained now\nWhere okay you might be able to find something and you know family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nAre and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that it's going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer glass of wine okay because there may click in other places\nAre and then of course there's Dobbins surge which is another place for you to check but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially this is his daughter and say you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if you want and then you could start snooping around see if there's anything else out there\nYeah I don't think he wants anybody lifting\nUm he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know [noise] why\nYou have a we have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nA might get is telling me that she is his daughter and I don't\nShe's got a very good background and I think she's just got to get what she can get\nYour check well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just count to your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first is going to ask for ten dollars then it's gonna be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she ask for money so that this way you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember or sound like he probably and I'm going to tell you now that I think about

a future sponsored so I'll just say there's a place you just call bone marrow Brett\n[noise] [laughter] I'm Talking in code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazing\nWe delicious food yeah did the Greek salad ... it's about sod I've ever had but every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that has just standing there at the register\nSo because of the bone marrow I developed a seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet\nI Will tip you well if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do that if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay a lot of farmers market I bought the spinach pasta\nWhose twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the tip of course not\nOkay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for it and what I Love about the call is she treats her station like it is a business so she's professional she'd done time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water to make it happen\nAnd and for somebody her age to have the type of business documented something she used a square\nAnd to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent so I told her I said you know I said you got this all wrong\nAnd she's like what do you mean and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put it in the middle that's what people are going to help and there'll be a certain percentage\nThat will that you can guilt them into going to you know the third call it which is the goal of all businesses have people out of more money if I told her explained to her I said so you know you're married\nYou got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kid you know and the you know and they're trying to get a they need to know you know they're getting ready for college and they're cheekbones looking really hungry [laughter] whatever it may be\nI said seriously research has shown to instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nTo see if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty per se\nBut see it not different though because of that industry has a history of gratuity\nBut it's the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on the screen\nSo when you're up in an era you tip yeah really I Do that where they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay but here's the reason why\nGay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is the bar like Houston right and and\nWhen you wait tables and I also waited tables I when I was at ASU at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you don't wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at that so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but and bad but I put an Arab drought okay\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know they're they are there's the Starbucks I was up at Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something in common they had to tip jars\nOkay and so\nYou know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right one was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all your iPhone people and the iPhone tip jar with like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One didn't have\nAnything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box stocks chip here if you think the PlayStation sucks it's just a ploy it's just like you said before guilty people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we ordered or my sister's kids came over for dinner like we'll just get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars sounds like that's a lot more than I was expecting\nRight be automatically added on twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and you know door dash isn't it tore us for that and also overeat\nBecause they'll say like price things search okay and so they add another five dollars if you order something that the under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever maybe but maybe it's like\nBeing a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars we got two things\nI had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some to shake okay and if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars\nAnd so that's ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them\nAn extra four by I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this work otherwise the opposite are doing this for squares and stuff like that wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that total thinking about that so they can get the total\nAmount up by five\nDollars I Would think the tip of green dollars no no no you pay the whole transaction what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then\nIn the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did and that was that\nThat was it off it was it was it was an ordeal\nThat sets up on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting about I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] nice [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question and I bet you you will have input on how good is that question\nAre basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early day adventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see what we had those digital lives\nAnd we're now in possession of a stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D. P. side uh which is a file transfer side\nOf that we can get a for our kids to be able to jump on there and drag that twenty two gig radio\nUh back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital uh we decided to call the camp commander show so here you're dealt\nIn so soon with this thought is Andrew in that they use like a drop box or something like that right and it's good money too good at huge really huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nBut then you can delete it\nYou want to you or you can protect it yeah you can protect and put in on it you know with a um a private you are\nWas you know really short party has said she's she can't walk very far had she's not even one so it might work for food is really cool it is it's very but two thousand I think I Would you think the drones going to be a year from now a thousand dollars\nMaybe but I bet you\nOkay finally if you're trying to keep tabs on your caffeine intake\nThere's now these smart coffee cup that's where I live in and you're going to know what it's all about amber has a couple of temperature control smart mugs on sale already ceramic one David stainless steel plastic travel\nAnd the whole idea is with the smart mouthed that you can choose your desire temperature in the mud will keep your coffee tea whatever at a certain temperature for two hours okay\nBut here's the deal now the smart mug has an app yes with a companion up you didn't know that you needed an app to go along with your ...\nBut now this Bluetooth link allows you to know your daily caffeine intake because the data's passed to the health app that will alerts you if you hit your recommended maximum daily caffeine levels\nBecause you're ready to\nDrinking too much coffee can cause a lot tape problem\nTo get All right that's all I got that's all I got remember the last story when I said that's really cool and that's a product I really want yes reverse that for the best one you know a lot of people are worried are kept saying how does it come to even know how much caffeine is in a cup of coffee well because you have to actually say on the app\nThat this is coffee this he this is a Starbucks local law pay a lot they profit and whatever that is Fifteen dollar for up to ... Seventeen after two [laughter] yes exactly especially if you're an apple versus Android\nNone none none of the cubs to my house connect to the Internet so how much does this cup cost\nTwo hundred and Ninety nine dollars on a ... and then of course there's a subscription she didn't know there is a monthly fee for my cup you know I haven't I've given up a smart water bottle I don't know if you've noticed I don't have it around me oh we definitely noticed in ... I mean\nI was ... I had high hopes for that smart or how many weeks three weeks to that last I don't think it lasted that then you know what if you ever want to take the over under on anything that should've been at first because you went to ... I mean you have like to have a lot of conversation about it was really cool I mean you know that this thing would blink whenever I needed to drink water\nAnd then it would keep track of that yeah you can't keep track of it when you're sitting in your closet and it doesn't really work okay I mean I Wish it were doesn't really work but\nTwo hundred and Ninety dollars for a ... I don't know I made that up it's probably not true and it's probably Ninety voluntary here's a hundred and fifty okay close it's still outrageous stupid but you know what\nSomebody's going to buy like somebody's going to buy that two hundred and twenty nine thousand dollar diamond emerald encrusted I our apple watch for kind of a drinking coffee no sorry I only have one bar I Can't right now [laughter] we don't just wait just wait [laughter] hey listen you've already\nTalking about the absent ego tank forty seven fifty for years I Love this printer and the reason why is it comes with enough Inc right in the box print up to eleven thousand color page is pretty amazing stuff order epson printers used the criminal code ... Kim through November first shouldn't get free shipping free overnight shipping\nEpson exceed your vision you want to stay right where you are because coming up at our money Tim we'd love to talk about all the gadgets and gizmos here on became commando show well we put together a list\nOf gadgets not like the smart mug not really like the drone not like the four thousand dollars for couch that are actually worth your money and then later on there's a setting in your browser\nIt doesn't it doesn't really horrible place I live in spring grows right next to the garbage town Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas and she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... them for home wireless countries in rural and she has her for her so even violence\nThe company that you're thinking about switching to use the rising powers and she's like oh they use all the same stuff is going to be all the same\nKind of action and then she went what if\nWhat if it's worse [laughter] what if it's where I Need to call him and it's so frustrating though isn't it I mean\nWhen you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right now if a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial here and I know I think I missed by yeah you're right on the U.S\nIs that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't have say\nA fiber optic next I mean that is\nNow a requirement it's like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and fiber connections so that this way you don't have to worry about what's going on so so Karen you don't have all bars in all places that's what\nI'm hearing that is correct [noise] and there's no way that you want to move to the big city or no no we're going to stay right here okay it's a ... but then when you complained of arise and what did they say\n[noise] um they really can't get many answer I've been I've been with ... twenty twelve okay but the past month [noise] it is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [noise]\nMoney it's a Halloween right just a couple of weeks away might be saying how do I kind of get my house all decked out probably in the smart way the tech way well a couple of symptoms you might want to check out one called the so vain you're smart plus range\nAnd some bald Eli de floods spotlights flexible lighting stripped outdoor garden lights and the the here's the thing is that they come with their own app so you can program all but\nIt also works with Amazon election that Google assistance and also apple Comcast there's also the smart puts garden spot and many don't worry about writing this down we have some more information over a commander dot com\nBut then you're going to need to think I'm all up and then you're going to need to add some spooky town and so that's where a cue labs and have Halloween living scenes and she will Halloween which is an avid Hugh haunted house those are some uh lighting and music app through there are ways that you can still step up to a game\nAnd get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nKill great to talk to you\nWouldn't think so much for your call today or what's going on\nI Would say I'm a small theater group a good way to put on ... a year that I live in an old movie theatre here in great then I'll have cool that\nIt's off of oil or the whole ball to the oil we deserve a good time to be on the hook on total news is up or we get our keys to the church to call them tractors to all these people and we never get a law or the duplicate so we got from the keys floating\nAll on me [laughter] running all over the county everybody's got to care\nEverybody's got to a young kid at this place when we were having a hard time for children so our idea is to one of the doors who would like to put like a digital type law\nSure that we can program with codes and give them now is the truth I liked ... automatically explode or twenty four dollars or ... or ... or whatever is needed for that and the second to this\nLittle light or a little guilty to a program like the one side but it was ... ... nobody stopped at all the time\nRight well we don't live on you know the good news is that the technology exists\nThe even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use okay and so when you buy the smartest lock and that a couple of ways you can do it um I actually have on a ... house that I own\nAnd that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay and\nSo when somebody books through ... ... I can go in I can put their name in and I can say this law is going to work on this Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre ...\nAnd you put the person's name in there and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay\nAwesome and you can program this remotely program is right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock it's not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock\nIf you're looking for the ... the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen and the August lock as the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet did you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay and so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next year okay\nAnd then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you have certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying and that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts\nSo once you once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby you start thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to that sprang\nIt is so good ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about right\nThere that's awesome idea yeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things no this is where it gets\nConfusing is that you've got the wave and dig being you know those are different standards or a ... and that works with the smart things next yeah everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next\nYear or so so so that's what I'm trying to I'm trying to expand your horizons so once we had the ... what else can we do is that a\nLot of things yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool off put actors on stage with the holograms turning on the ground\nYou know Andrew or don't you think that you and I would add be excellent at doing like a theatre version of became commando show absolutely agree making a musical\nWell I don't know I can think commando units that\nOne but I don't I don't think we'd go past when that happened about memory ends up being a popular demand women I don't think in in Griffin canvas that was [laughter] we didn't even make it sound like\nLike Broadway in ... that was it that the off off off off the authors runs right or the ... it's more intimate\nBut without the absolutely\n[laughter] All right so the next census is going to set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month All right it's not that not a big deal to uh\nLook at the ... the leg fence and connect OK okay the next ... about sixty bucks the lock is going to touch back a hundred and Fifteen and you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month\nAnd then it allows you to program all those codes get report to come in and what's going on with that and then if you could set up for twenty four hours and then if somebody does it do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code it killed ... automatically there's no delay\nYou can also un flood yeah you can set up a code really if you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely a really make sense that you start looking at smart stuff in order to\nBe notified and get alerts and good things like that hey Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on in great band and how that locks working out for you\nAll right speaking of homes was talk a little bit about simply save longtime sponsor of the Kim commando show and you know I remember when I first met Chad the founder of simply safe and he sat back and I walked upstairs to my office and I thought to myself well you know Chad the adventurous simply say if he's just one of those guys\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself for my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you

I'll say a car if you need when you have to tell you anything [laughter]\nAnd he just sounds violates that ended up but you don't let the Glenn in Wyoming Glen you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nUm have you got a two thousand and five Victor ... so long that Ford or [noise]\nAnd [noise] and when I come to a stop\nOr whether it's a well a jump to stop them from stopped there I was a split second after I come to stop I feel the clock\nAnd it reminds me of perhaps something like a motor mount may be in park in one direction and when you stop\nIt ... back down to a ... normal direction or normal delicious fat [noise] I don't know why I thought of that but it's kind of an unusual I Would think an unusual curves [noise]\nKind of like a kind of like a golf ball loose in the back of the truck and when you come to a stop it rolls forward just gives you a little too little\nIt seems to be a rotational cough or I mean I you know you know not like something's coming forward or backward but\nI'm following you I like that description is it like like the drive shaft and and I would go that way because some of these trucks did have a little rotational issue with the dry chef yolk the front Dr chef yolk they would as you come to a stop they just had a little from the click the\nAs more of a thug than a click but it would it would move and they had a bulletin\nFor people under warranty when they were in warranty out of warranty they just didn't do anything about it but under warranty they were putting in nickel plated Dr chefs yolks you remember that can do three huge on Silverado the Hummer aged who's had a big thing about him\nAnd uh that yeah that that took care of that but it may not be that but it could be that's one thing the other\nLeafs springs was the yeah exactly Shannon the rear least springs you read my mind\nYeah but I Can't remember what the situation was there was a ... ads between the spring would shift\nJust a tiny bit so how we diagnose at one of our guys that are shop has a wireless chassis eager is what it's called and it has several transmitters with a little alligator clip and we they're magnetic we\nMap under the metal parts of the body\nClip them on and then we go inside and we can push the buttons on the unit and Chris is like a really fascinating and you push the button and you can listen to all the parts of the VA way better than the guy riding the ... down the highway the vehicle and like the average improvement yes which I have participated in many years ago sorry we Murtha\nUm anyway [laughter]\n... yeah so we can listen and see what's creeping in if we hear more of a ... and it may not be a perfect identification but if we hear that there's more of a creek at that dry chef slip yolk\nThan on a spring we know we need to be in that area to find it and you can almost never find it when you raised on a horse because a car sits at a certain level with the springs compressed a certain way on the ground when you raise it up and everything drops down on the suspension you just can't\nYou just can't find it in a perfect world we all have chassis diners in our shop to run all four wheeled and a spot where we could walk under the vehicle while it was on the chassis dynamo doing it's normal liberty thing and listen for those items which would be\nA way for most shaker with a happy die you know I got ... spring\nRelated uh it seems like you would [noise] he would feel the clock right wing downward rather than just\nReally wouldn't be a rotational and I and I and I'm Glad you said that rotational thing because in my head\nI I get that I'm I'm I can feel in my head\nRotational ... versus just a clump of like a golf ball hit in the back of the cabinet and and they're different sounds if you listen to the vehicle we have these things that we called by the order and the orders are you know first or second or third order when you're going down the road your\nYou know your engine is turning at let's say two thousand rpm and if it's in direct drive your dry shaft is turning it two thousand rpm that doesn't mean you're wheels are turning at that speed because if you've got a\nFour like say a four to one rear end you're turning around the dry chef four times for every one time of the wheels so if you're click as you move forward goes click\nClick click and that's equal to one two three revolutions of a tire that'd be like a first order like if it's going click click click click so four times for every one time that we'll goes around you know what's in your drive line and we listen for those kinds of\nThings in a a trained mechanic over the years will start to pick that up and they'll say that to see the chef click that is not a tire shift or are tired noise or ... you know drive shaft or whatever it is they can pick those things up very interesting\nGlenn thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Bruce Bruce you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\n[laughter] [noise] ... [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] stripping [laughter] [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah well the the way that set we use the computer to set it you need to plug it scanned tool in and it'll say\nIt'll say distributor offset an zero degrees on those so it's there's the computer handles everything so you want to zero so what you do as you started up and let's say it says plots Thirteen that's enough to turn to check engine light on so what you'll do at that point is you'll move the distributor the direction needed to go back toward zero\nMove it there then tightening down start the vehicle up read the scanner again and if it says plots to shut it back off move the distributor just to hear more tightened it up fired up until the the engine read zero you don't need the disconnected me then you just do that until the offset says\nZero if you have advanced or retarded a little bit they actually call that now instead of a distributor a high voltage switch it's just ... which plug it goes to if it's off a little the engine may run really well but it'll burn a distributor capping Roeder up quickly so\nThat's why they want that perfectly at zero so that's how you set it you need a of a scandal\nDon't be scared of that scandal thing it doesn't have to be a really fancy ... it can be one\nPicked up at your local auto parts store they can be picked up for as little as ... fifty two hundred bucks for some of the basic ones that just read basically will be two codes and scanned data\nBruce all have you know that a

don't\nThen you're which is probably bad because you know you've got no voters there but you've got voltage or other wires that if it is a switch that's like a sixteen dollar apart or something like that not too bad\nWell wait a minute rush you know in this country for a yeah I Do I Believe for a I I was doing some work on that but I already bought the sweat charted I did before I put in that when they went outside with the switch it still doesn't work\nCake bend your next step is you've got to pull the switch out check the voltage there see if you got voltage coming out of that wire that voltage should go all the way up to the gauges have you got it at the switch but you don't have it at the gauges you got to open ... or somewhere in between something's not connected good if you do have power all the way the gauges then you need to check\nYour ground if you've got power ground though you're both burned out which is unlikely to have every one of them all but one of the two will be gone either you're missing voltage at the switch\nOr somewhere in between because he got a broken wires that use the circuit on the back like the Ford pickup she used to use that to the gay jail or like a little printed printed circuit on the back and those can break you can have a little break and there were more than ... than in the back of that age I think that one's got around plug with patients but they back and breaking not connect\nRounds can do to in that bashed with a weather radio goes in that car make sure that that wire that goes that same color wire that goes to the back of the radio is not a\nShortage or in the ashtray that the ashtray light is not shorter than in cause and that thing to have a a bad circuit that'll do it to a couple of things to jackets\nAh I it sounds as you'll type thing to me I got a strong suspicion that is a fuel thing where you're having to crank it several times to give to fire up and that can come from fuel pumps that are getting weak\nFresher bleeding down so how we would check it in our shop would be to put a fuel pressure gauge on it we would started after his set for an hour and read the pressure compare that to what\nIt looks like when it's been sitting for eight to ten or twelve hours or more and if we find there's no pressure there when we started after that long period of time but there's pressure after a very short period less than eight hours like you're saying it'd be leaning towards the fuel system issue\nThanks very much for the call let's talk to our list are less you're on the ended up would show what can we do for you\nI I have a two thousand and eight or ... ah thirty four thousand miles and it developed a clicking sound when I first get in turn the key on that not starting gets into that position um\nThere's a clicking it sounds like it comes from the dash and just click click click eighty six clicked for so and\nIn that and there's also while they're taught for like a little boring sound from a small motor runs about that time off so and then it starts up in one by one more clicking after that it's just\nBy first turn it off\nSo just to make sure this isn't a clicking noises that is stopping the vehicle from starting like a typical power situation we get a lot of calls on if you if you went to crank weight away the car would start\nYes it's not like a you know I Will vote each other battery in your ...\nOkay like whatever it's not engage in no it's not that it it sounds like it's coming from ... in the dash area and and it starts up every time\nA lot of those types of noises and now I don't know me out of that well maybe Russia's had one in we've had experience with it uh but there it's a ... I'm guessing they're using fairly common Mazda\nType pieces and there is probably an actual waiter for the blend doors or the the uh the you know just for the age ... and they they can they can make a clicking ratcheting noise if they try to index or if there's something wrong with them\nDoes all your heating and cooling stuff seem to work okay once the car gets going\nYes and I I Wonder if that was the problem and I don't know enough about the mechanics of it I I turned off the a C and he did that was a nature that was all turned out than it and it still does it on that makes a difference or not\nIt's a good that's a good test to try that whenever you have a thing because we'll have people come in and they absolutely have no clue and they haven't tried those things and others will say well when I turn off the year before I shut the\nCar off if he doesn't make that noise so we've got an a faster when that'll help you save money when you go into a technician to be able to point them a direction but I think Janet is right on with it you could do something in their\nSomething's coming on and it it without seeing it I mean I might sit in and go oh I Know exactly what that is but without seeing it it'll make it a little difficult in this situation\nYou want to see it or hear it that they see the car here's annoyance right there you go into it\nIt's gotta be something in there that's it and it may be a normal operation something you're turning on normally should click on when you turn the key on but there's a starting to be a failure in it or if you've got to relate it's getting week it's just kind of bugs and until the vet both voltage comes up on the battery when the old Nader surcharges and then it stops\nThat's a possibility we've seen that as far as good old\nUm some things you can put up with they'll be just fine like that are the ones you need to get checked and find out what's going on but you may find as we go along the noise may go away but then you go hey oh my my heater doors aren't working", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Rapid City", "day": "20"}
