Barletta running against incumbent Democrat Bob casey\nOn that US Senate seat Casey is a has turned out to be a complete disaster quarantine state he was elected because his father was\nA pro life of course governor of the great state of Pennsylvania and so he has a lot of not name id on the ... the head man ... he had been a non issue or just a reliable a supporter of liberal policies and meanwhile Lou Barletta cut his teeth\nOr as a a mayor and eight dodge believer in enforcing our immigration laws and he warned of a lot of what we're seeing happening right now and in the country he warned of ... years ago when I first\nHad him on the show we thought we'd check in with him and see how things are going on the campaign again it's a tough race but we think it's important to talk about all these races and we're going to do that throughout the show today Lou how you doing I'm\nDoing good words or you know this race has got to take a turn\nIn the last few weeks where are we thought we saw a low point in American politics\nOr with what the Democrats that was a with Kavanaugh but here in Pennsylvania Senator Casey decided to take it or even less lower uh which I think as has backfired and it really has made this race a very very close to\nExplain what you're talking about a listener so\nYes so I have four daughters and and uh\nUh my one daughter who was blessed with miracle twins are and just recently we found out that Jordan was diagnosed with cancer and would need forty two weeks of chemotherapy\nAnd radiation and I had just learned up there and was that there nine eleven ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania where Senator Casey and his wife\nOr were there also and I was really upset and confided in him in ... and told him that this personal story of the twins and how they were born and now Jordan has cancer and we haven't been children's hospital of Philadelphia and how exciting it\nWas and it really you know\nReally puts things in perspective and a ... by ... about a month later a firm that conversation I had with my brother who are very close works passed away\nOr we buried my brother on a Friday Saturday the following day Senator Casey began running commercials in Pennsylvania during my situation that I had told him\nWith the twins and cancer\nA and the woman in the commercial said that if we were leather had his way children like mine would be provided health care and it was obviously devastating to my daughter and my family myself I pleaded with ... cricket commercial down that I felt that was some sort of a heartless\nBecause that's er to me was that votes have consequences and you will be held accountable and November it wasn't I'm Sorry it was an hour to realize the parallel it was like I'm going to charge you even more in spite of what I've just gone through\nA and people in Pennsylvania and I just you know just cannot believe even his burns can understand what would cause him to do something to be so heart lets people\nSee are you are you saying that he green let this commercial and he in in twenty four hours he they wrote a commercial that used or or had an example I'm an anecdote that used your story or that it was already in the pipeline they should have taken it down\nIt wasn't running yet so whether they already had they had it in the pipeline of what they were going I I've I've just found it pretty ironic yeah what tasteless\nYet he was a commercial that had twins with cancer or something you think about doing when you're doing a commercial\nAnd the fact that he rabid after he knew what happened and and and wouldn't take it down he he only will take it down in Scranton uh because his own friends and family chance than seeing a but yet it's still running as we speak today he's he continues to run this\nBack about ... disgraceful excuse me on but I think look at the very least you should have\nJust taken a taking the thing down if you didn't know if it if it was some wild coincidence you should have just taken a down a little bit I think for you for you the best thing to do at this point it's a run on the issues and the issues are facing the country today\nAre are of course the immigration crushed at the border which affects every aspect of our lives from economic to national security and health and and uh all other concerns a sovereignty and so forth\nAnd ... what do you believe should be done with these ah roving hordes of border busters\nWhat they would have listened to me back in two thousand six maybe ... you know we wouldn't have had this problem you know I I I've been standing up against illegal immigration this is an invasion there was no other way\nThere's no other way to put it and it's people like Senator Bob casey who supporter of support catch and release\nA that is really just encouraging people and and you know for all these years of of this week politicians in Washington who who want to talk about a pathway to citizenship basically giving a green light to people all over the world come to America once you get here you can't leave\nThe American people are fed up with this this is why Donald Trump was elected president because they want people up a backbone and save lives and we're the most generous country in the world\nAnd he really as as I write about in boxing the barricades my new paperback\nHe his election really was the bellwether for what what's to come with Donald Trump on feeding the old dinosaur Eric Cantor and ah he won reelection last time and he's got a ... one ... win re election now it's critical absolutely critical for years ago she's ...\nI'm All right let's go to Sylvia in Pennsylvania outline one Sylvia\nHi Laura how you doing I'm great thanks I'm ...\nI'm just calling in support of the old Lou Barletta just sit on your show uh I live in an area that's about halfway between hazel ten in Scranton and it's still all very much for Donald Trump to the polls in twenty sixteen never reflected how much\nSupport there was for Donald Trump and uh\nIt's still that way when I talk to my friends and neighbors nobody has backed off we are still all very much behind Donald Trump is very much for Lou Barletta in\nPhilly Philly some Rob I'm always has been at Philadelphia in the Philadelphia suburbs so it's Bryn Mawr Contra hawk and uh you know it's it's the main line and that's that's always drag the rest of the state down and it's going to continue to do so Philadelphia's a completely different city\nOr it's changed I'm ... and there was a ... I think in the New York times about the demographic changes to\nUh the Philadelphia in a normal Asian population and that little small business owners and great people are but it changed politically as well and we'll see where it all ends up but a pack in Pennsylvania is arriving in this Trump economy why would you vote against\nPositive economic news which is tantamount of what people would do

or one of my favorite places of Minnesota a car in a joins us now the races pretty tight\nUh the latest real poll shows that the Democrats up\nI'm about six percent\nAnd I think that it's within striking distance no doubt about it a car and it's good to have you with us how are things going on the trail\nI it's gone just great Laura thank you so much for having me and yeah we have close the gap in the polls that when you're speaking of was done by our our Minneapolis Star Tribune which we sometimes called the red star\nA and that one had the damage is six and then the one before that another Democrat Paul happy down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting immigrant folks and\nHad a big debate the other night only state wide televised debate and my opponent chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate [noise]\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have\nMade some fairly significant headway in in\nA both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and uh since uh you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive uh uptick in the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against that now\n[noise] or they don't ah we had a or Minnesota is turning Brad across the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going\nAnd I think Tina let's didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answer to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far left and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing\nEverything good that is happening on the ground a and then she's also a for open borders and she wants Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on called for another investigation so Minnesotans are are\nSome of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and\nAnd that we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out in the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina's that didn't want to ... or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of democratic fundraising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of the more vulnerable in our house candidates are But Ryan says there's an enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state\nOf last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates are and they they believe that if they can fully turn Minnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened here so we go for it happened we could have told you what was going to happen\nOn Minnesota is definitely turning red we've slipped our state house in two thousand fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteenth or we've got up on the iron range which had voted\nNow they're lucky if they get the the majority in the house and and let them\nWhat happens is all the momentum of the blue way\nWhy never has been turned away because a human progress never roles in on wheels of inevitability and the reason why it's difficult and I I'm Still very confident that we are going to take the house and I I Believe that uh we're going to surprise a lot of people in the U.S Senate as well\nAnd and the reason why it is hard to win sixty seven eight states and because of the vast majority of states\nThat districts are so heavily and gerrymandered we know when we get a fair shake like in states like Pennsylvania where the districts are fair Democrats are going to do very very well\nWho is that I don't know who that is who is a\nI mean he doesn't exactly have a you know that was a ... or the DNC\nYeah I mean so they're all they're all Navajo I said\n... horrible blue I Would simply ways let me tell you if they don't win like if they don't win some of these key seats that they predicted they were gonna win I don't know what the the left wing activists are going to do I mean I I don't know how they're going to\nI I honestly it's they could they could they could go even more left wing than they are going now\nThey made a big mistake though the Democrats made a huge mistake and how they played this they went for the Alexandria a cost ya Cortez style\nApproach to campaigning and that works in the big cities but most people in the country aren't from Brooklyn or aren't from one of the boroughs of Manhattan\nI Know but most people in Florida Today due to the migration of people from New Jersey New York down to Florida because of the taxes because they can retire there without the personal income taxes in the state\nThere's been a huge migration of people from the northeast that is ... ... and change in the culture of Florida and they did now predominantly people from the northeast and lots of immigrants from Cuba\nFrom a Puerto Rican click thirty thousand Puerto Ricans remember the president had only one or two thousand votes are American\nCitizens are of course in Puerto Rico but they're voting now in Florida the Democrats have done a very good job of recruiting them of getting them registered to vote in Florida as Florida new Florida resident\nAnd this race will tell the tale if a guy like Gillum with his checkered history under an ethics pro and now we have an FBI interesting that he was caught and\nIf this doesn't damage candidates like this an untested guy with a mayor of failing city like Tallahassee if this is what they think it's going to lead the state God Bless them now but this will be this will be the bellwether for the president and

Hitler in ... he got in tight really early\nAnd then they brought in Franco and then they brought into her show and pretty soon you had this access some of these hard right powers and it's starting to look to me like Trump is recreating that\nWith the United states and get into bed with all these autocratic authoritarian regimes and rejecting the norms of democracy and step one is to prepare the people it's the cause of the people to think oh there's an external enemy out there they're coming to get us they're terrible hold changed their among us we have to perjure ourselves of these people this is an\nOld old song\nT I got I got a little I Would thank him for the call can you out and run ... taken out of what's up\n[noise] I just wanted to let you know that in the last\nTwo years time I had been cold and the word a polite to speak\nWith would launch a four times in the last two years prior to that I had not been been called that were directly ah for many many years and in two of those situations uh it actually got to the point where\nThere was some touching a\nAnd I think that uh\nYou have a president to has pardon people like Joe so far ... he's\nGiven all kinds of part and she said that I'll pay your legal fees at his rallies if you beat up somebody got black guy over there or whatever it is a troublemaker I'll pay your legal fees you talking about ... terrorism there were version and civil rights acts laws affirmative action lost all of that stuff's going on right now with Jeff Sessions\nThere's all kinds of stuff going on and you let me tell you something this isn't this isn't a dog whistle anymore it's not just those those are the missiles you talked about there are lots of little hand grenades and people are being embolden by this guy's rhetoric and it's happening at the street level yep\nI I retreated yesterday a a Nineteen thirty eight American documentary on Germany\nUm and uh it's about a Fifteen minute long clip and it's it's a shocking and ah but the main point of it was that the German people were experiencing in Nineteen thirty eight now this was before the invasion of Poland right\nThis was there were already work camps set up around Germany that the Jews and communists and trade union is and what not had been sent to to work but all you know they they went to Berlin and they walked you know all over the city and here's all these prosperous uh you know a white Christians\nUh you know as prosperous city people having nice meals together the media has been shut down the the public dissent has been shut down there are no dissenting voices there's only one party and yet people\nLoving it uh you know from from this American documentary of what was going on in Germany and then of course then chronicled the rise the American born with a half a million members all across the United states wearing swastikas and and taking over like VFW halls and things and doing pile Hitler it it's it's like we forget\nOr you know it's not that we forget we're not old enough to remember the people who actually knew it from first hand experience are dead\nAnd and and we have not been studying our history and in fact since you know bill Bennett with the Reagan Administration said no more civics as a as as you know part of the the guidelines federal guidelines for education\nYou know we've we've now got a very small percentage of our schools in the United states but even teach civics much less history of any consequences people don't realize how fast this stuff's spreads and I think the the word fascism that was used in Europe in the thirties\nIs going to a new word is going to be nationalism and that means the exact same thing and Donald Trump kicked it off yesterday or you can\n... thank you for the call Dana and I point North Carolina ... what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi Tom and I just got to say that decades before ... attacked our election process we were influenced by a foreign power for Twenty years or the Australian Rupert Murdoch\nHas been doing everything he can to be the the author or end the dedicated relentless driver of our descent into fascism I mean they are the original fake news and always have been\nAnd this is Kevin rod wrote this piece for the Sunday Morning Harold ... a few weeks ago called the cancer at the core of Australian democracy\nRupert Murdoch perfect and governor on his foreign prime minister\nYou so he should know yeah yeah and it still can stick terrorism I mean they ... they're the author of that and the dry river there's all the examples you gave shown\nAnd they they literally trained Donald Trump for eight years during the Obama administration to not believe his birth to to hate ... everything you do to the point that Trump is now reversing everything that Obama did where did he learn that from\nFox News Fox propaganda is what's running this country now Trump listens to you know Fox and friends he tweets out any lie that Hannity promotes Hannity is as much running the country is Trump is\nAnd then and then Republicans run around and try to make the law is true you know as somebody on Fox says J there should be a ten percent tax cut from working people that would go over well Trump announces that are at a at a rally in with a tweet\nAnd so then a Republican congressman says okay I got to write a resolution resolution has no legal force whatsoever it's not a lot simply a statement\nI'm going to write a resolution saying that we want to have a ten percent tax cut for the average working person making Trump not a liar anymore I mean it's bizarre what's going on and you're right so much of this starts right there with Fox so-called news\nYeah and Trump doesn't read anything or learn anything or even listen to the information from his intelligence he listens to Fox News he that\nThat's his entire school from which he learns\nYeah and this is a damn scary thing then I Want to get one more call in here before the end of the hour

very concerned about why somebody would send a bomb to Debbie Wasserman Schultz or Andrew Cuomo because\nThose people that are not typical demonized on the right they don't even know who Debbie Wasserman Schultz is probably don't love your bombers from Florida\nWell possibly but Debbie Washington so I mean I just don't\nKnow she was on the way I mean you know typically the people who hey Debbie Wasserman Schultz are the people who are part of the burning campaign if that was your point Anita um but you know I\nDon't think we shouldn't demonize tournament evil character if you don't agree with them that's one thing but she was trying to do some sort of character she was talking oh sure I think it was fine to destroy Bernie Sanders yeah I think we just\nI just want to keep that in mind because we need to be careful before we\nDon't pass a language that was used to describe Debbie Wasserman Schultz I heard language anything I was I did not and I heard about that close to they're

New Mexico I was just in beer a cruise ship for a vacation and I saw\nLike a young fourteen year old ... ill\nDressed enclosed like he was from what the ... he was dead in the side of the road\nAnd unlike the good Samaritan I didn't stop to give him water he was already did I could see but I told the guard at the entrance of the park that I was hiking and so what's going to happen or what are the Democrats planning to do when a when the\nUh the refugees at the border thank you\nYeah Hi Daniel thinks I'm for the question and you know I understand too um at least from listening to the radio this morning I always or when I'm driving and I listen to both Fox I Am and MSNBC radio it's on a and just to see what they're talking about for the day and are you on Fox they're talking about a new caravan from El Salvador right they love the caravan conversation\nI'm for us I mean you know we have to do comprehensive immigration reform short of that we've got to address\nThe issue is issues as they come up by the time that caravan hits that don't forget some people are going to stay in Mexico along the way in won't make it to the border for other reasons\nBut by the time it hits it can be about the time that we're doing a the funding or for the homeland security or and they will I think very likely especially if we take the majority tried to use it to find funding for the wall so we're gonna have to address that we're going to need people to be there to help us on the calls\nAre when that time comes but I'm expecting a very robust\nLame duck period this being one of the main issues in addition to the wall we've been able to hold back funding with Republicans help\nUp to this point 'cause even most of them privately tell you they know it's ridiculous but I'm a fearful that when this gets here there's going to be a real push so I think in the short term that that we've got to deal with the long term we absolutely have to get the comprehensive immigration reform that also provides for a pathway to citizenship\nFor aspiring Americans Thirteen million people here I Need us to address that in a comprehensive way\nHarold in Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the air with Congress and folk and\n\nIs it I'm On the air you are Harold\nYou're oh okay I'm just want to talk about a single payer or insurance I just got a month ago I got back from from a trip to Germany\nAnd unfortunately I forgot that I ran out of a couple of medications and so it took ... went to a pharmacy in Germany and got\nGot the medication and this one I got to take for for diabetes and one for the heart so I Do have some problems but anyway so I purchase those as soon as I Am not insured in Germany so I had to buy\nThe a medication and it was the American medicated American Made a same medication let him go in here so um and they come in pre package or a pre packaged not like any other\nTypically a blister packs in Germany\nWrites correct so\nI got those thirty the supplies so one month supply that one\nA medication that I got for the diabetes was um\nA Cosby forty four euros which is or maybe fifty eight dollars or something like the ... I paid the last time I pick that medication up here it's a four hundred and some dollars\nAnd the other one was for the hearts\nSame thing for thirty days supply\nI paid forty eight dollars so buck sixty or sixty two year rose above sixty or sixty two dollars\nI paid almost eight hundred dollars for that medication here and it's ... it's the same thing it's the same medication and are made in America\nRight it's a horror story or what's your question for congressman poking\nThe question is the question is that we must go to a single payer or\nInsurance that's where the prices come from and give the American company that sold those medications in Europe they did not sell them at a loss\nYou know no they wouldn't be in the marketplace if they had a ... thoughts on this thank\nSo I mean ... I completely agree why we need to move to a single parent but also let me just add\nOn the prescription drug front we also are I think can walk and chew gum at the same time because I think that one we can address hopefully quicker um there's no question that a pharmaceutical companies many of them are ripping off the American public are at an incredible rate\nOr what you just gave her two great examples so we had a press conference when Pfizer was going to buy an Irish company or to through a legal loopholes and not pay us taxes and we put a list of all the drugs a major drugs they have\nA what they charge in Ireland and what they charge us in some cases it was one twentieth\nOf the cost for the same drug or there's no reason we should be ripped off and uh we need\nRob in Phoenix, Arizona you're on their cars and poke him\nYes Congress ... hey I spoke to you last week or a prior above the Social Security income tax deduction\nAnd this is my point when I was trying to point out is is right now it's a [noise] excuse me a hundred and thirty two dollars I think it's like a hundred and Ninety eight I Believe yeah hunter was growing up though I think one thirty two but regardless of like going up to three per se\nSix point three percent the doctrine that one thirty to my point was like if you do hold a cat you wouldn't have the tax we need to go from six point tree down to two or three something if you double it again it would go down to one percent so basically what you you could do if you push the limit or\nYou can lower the tax down to like one percent the government would still be making the same amount of money to fulfill via a Social Security uh requirements\nAnd that would immediately give everyone who makes a hundred and thirty two thousand or a tax break of all you know five percent right off the bat\nI'm it also since corporations are people you know we should say I got a tax on do their uh income taxes well ...\nYeah Rob so the the differences right now we have someone longevity problems with the\nSocial Security because of the population so we're actually trying to bring in revenue to it so I think part of the conversation has been about lifting the cap again rightfully so it's regressive tax when people who make\nI think this year one Twain or maybe last year one twenty nine eight this year might be one thirty two I don't pay another dime into the system but we if we lifted the kept completely you of over Seventy five years of future I into the Social Security fund that is probably the the most ... you know dressing\nA problem we have right now not so much that we're trying to lower that tax for people it's that you want to make sure the fund is available for people and a lot of us would like to talk about you know I'm expanding it and providing a\nMaybe a increase tied to the consumer price index e which addresses with seniors pay twenty five percent of their income on medications and healthcare or rather than the CPI which is you know often focused on things like gasoline and stuff that\nNot all seniors are spending money on so um I don't know if we're looking so much to try to cut the rate of attacks as much as keep the program alive which is the most pressing concerns\nYeah congressman we have a minute and a half before the end of the hour\nI'm not quite enough to get another caller in here although there are people with questions about Social Security and health care I I Know that you've touched on one of those topics but anyhow what what do you think we should be looking at in this next week and how do you think that we should be best reacting to these acts of terrorism that we're experiencing right now as a nation\nYeah I mean I I think\nYou know we're less than two weeks from the election um it's going to get wild and wooly in the next two weeks be ready for it uh but the best way to deal with that while the willingness as to you know put some time in\nA supporting candidates of either party that you support 'em knock on doors or make phone calls use your social media talk to your neighbors and friends because uh the election is really going to matter we saw what happened two years ago elections have consequences we need people to be active and um you know we can do it in a respectful way we don't have to think\nA down to the level that they have to sync too we can be aggressive on the issues\nI and still make our point and I think appeal to a broader a number of people that we need to for the election\nYou know and and are pushing back on the lives how do we push back on their absolutely\nLike you know the good news is the fact that right yeah we have those when the president says he's gonna cut taxes or by ten percent between now and the election you just say to people Congress has even in session like that there's not even not even possible like that is you know just an outright lie there is zero percent truth in it um\nThose kinds of things are fair to point out

engaged because then you don't need to make it worse\nFor the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have ... ... ... ... or ... ad going good and go away and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs\nAbout where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful of everything that's one of the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had\nThe empowerment within me that I could really a strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it's been just wonderful beautiful experience of\nWho's moving the plant you know Iran is that the individual or is there some spirit behind it who's movie\nAs well let me answer that from a few different directions\nOne as many people believe it's an idiot motor effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movement of your muscles are the power suggestion is making the plant shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or ... that the curry through your body and there's some old spots they would go way back to the Eighteen hundreds that's one thought about it to a third one is\nA is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plants at the moving spell out messages\nIn Beijing work where the ...\nThe amazing and I will say this or the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked to him before and I talked about before on your show and work with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say\nWhen you come to the plant chat you set your intention and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combined together ... reaches up to a level of vibration like\nTuning frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows messages to slow the plant you have to move and for that for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half with Karen ... your questions and maybe your review board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you go ... to put somebody down if they don't like the ... board met I appreciate it\nWell I I you know that's that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean one of your earlier guest is talking about the divisiveness and this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness brochure and I'm not for that I'm for having a discussion about it\nI'm for people having different opinions this tool is not for everybody\nI'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use a tool this kind of floor are different one so I think it's great that we come together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group the talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a among stuff with all of us believe it doesn't work\nSome some leaves it works because of the motor and a few of my believe it works because we're actually connect with an energy outside of herself but we can all this together have a love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum\nSo we're we're a group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning each other\nHaunted the board start in in how how long ago\nA will there's there's there's a what\nGenes gene Orlando has term do we just ... he owns the museum of talking boards dot com check it out um heat terms that we just dishes because people say the board started back in ancient China and Greece that it's not true there's a difference to have a nation tool that started back then the first board that we have\nA we have an understanding up because we have history of it we have documents that talk about it is a board it Eighteen eighty six known as the which board\nNow we know this board existed and was made by a company called the ws re toy company and George the cool thing about this is it's really interesting history the people who manufacture the board\nI sent a letter along with the board to president Grover Cleveland forest for his wedding gift and we'll do this I Know and we noticed because they picked up a tendency to send that exact same letter over the Boston Globe forgot published I mean they're matches the PR yup yup what do you think the president Cleveland it [noise]\nWell I Would guess she kept to board [noise] [laughter] well\nListen as we said the letter comes to them and it said honored sir we take the liberty city by express a day an article of her own manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention call though which board president Cleveland kindly wrote back and said I knowledge with thank the which board which you sent me as a wedding present\nI accepted as evidence of kind feeling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I needed to be tested powers to disclose the path in forecast the future\nWhat he did take it or knew he was he took it he took it I Would leave censored back\nOh well there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board it but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years but for for years and the earth now Eighteen Ninety eight and a group\nThis tool to board the device it's spelled out we ...\nThey they decided let's go we job\nSo and so they needed to get it patented\nSo in ... Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies your bond that the attorney for this group\nWent along with miss Helen peers they sat down at the board because they had to prove to the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous\nFinally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know me I don't know you if that thing there could spell out my name or a\nCharge what do you think happened it's bill daughter's name sure enough and the ... came alive you\nKnow didn't spell out his name with somebody on the planet ... where he probably would've accused him of doing something or did it work by itself you\nKnow you got to have you have all the plants and you have to let ... yeah you have\nTo so it started out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman a metallic Peters not for the uh is really critical a crucial to the naming of the board\nAnd also to get a patent Ted and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merged the chairman of the board of the ... dug up an old archives stories and letters about her and so if we were honoring her just last month and as a Denver, Colorado and\nGave her beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that would hurt the editor in buried at her plot their names are on it um\nShe was just on her she was lost to history but we resurrected her at our family was so great for thankful and and now she's got to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage and a group of people who do tours in his grave yard is called a fair amount\nA cemetery and Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nBut how do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of all ... board the proper way he felt and it was to burn it and he said as he was burning it\nOr he could see little sparks come read offered and screams she heard screams coming on to the board you believe up\nThe case so I don't have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how we view the world our own fears or own desires and so I mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we can't even truly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect our worlds to creating their manifest at I'm just gonna say that's the\nMonday's sunshine once again ice climbing to lower sixties loads fall back to forty on Monday and I had a chance for rain developing on Tuesday I ... for news radio ...

was would you do or where the voters Patrick Morrisey\nMore see and I approve this message I may go twenty five now till the top of the hour only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I have flown into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I've been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good vote with the right thing to do um but with that said um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates\nAs you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good now\nWe're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working them the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nYou know it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have you know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut energy in the life of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way I Would have never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened to the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell ya I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one not very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion and Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the use of the second amendment\nThere couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically of help serve as a bridge to President Trump's\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked it up before having you on today are meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when it count so you know I don't like the count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nFor him I Do not have ... well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat healthcare being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains stay Sean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty\nPercent in four years and match and said no to fix and getting rid of Obamacare and I think the west Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left\nTo our state providing economic opportunity better job\nOr Joe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters mansion says no and even on top it off where people say oh he ended up voting for cabin on the reality is\nHe waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast their vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically debt\nIs so so I you know I kind of used a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you don't vote for the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and well she ... she was like tax cuts regulation energy those are three main fundamental issues\nThat that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with a white opioid issues and we got on with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joe Manchin first vote will be for Chuck Schumer and Chuck Schumer has made no bones about the fact that he's going to head out the obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals\nThe folks that really created all the rock destroying the cabin on ... then\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about\nI've been able to get Dr Josh number outlets Seventy in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita he's duplicated in close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines getting first six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge carrier ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor or your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there all the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine concierge\nBlue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states of innovation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient\nSo there are a lot of good ideas and I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against that last minute but does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully thinks of the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days up but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the ... races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it's a chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Santa for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose the Josh Hawley\nA Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada uh we definitely need more than ...
