consciousness and healing as well as a Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\n[noise] [noise] well there's so many stories that um this one had stepped birth march or something like that right\nWell in Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation and he collected about a thousand case study of young children who had had\nA some experience in my past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical report and in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they\nHave some kind of unusual birth mark\n[noise] uh so it's not a typical mall but some kind of unusual birth mark and it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remember\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village or in Asia and\nHe um he in Stevens and then went and investigated a biography of this person that the child remembered me and it turns out that that person was shot\nThrough the chest in the same place entry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely\nEvidence but or evidence ... but it's still compelling in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded\nAnd he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early\nJust about the time he learned to speak remembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad what his dad was changing his diapers or I used to change your diet\nAnd ... and it was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this\nKid's started remembering other things about the kind of car that he

first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them and yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience\nSo it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it ...\nShapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things

bury your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this birds\nMore a wonder and and and and I'm sure you off into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share your experience of mine that I just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about sports or about the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and our our indigenous people are\nVery very very rich culture of a a mysticism and and also a you know being able to travel into you know in three dimensional in ... and um and explored the potential of the mine through ... through the ancient practices\nAnd so it's been building me overtime or the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travel and I was traveling from Nicaragua and then the and the and in Nicaragua there is a a jungle called lock them on negative or roughly child would it'd be a black a jungle and uh this this black jungle is just to the ocean jungle with\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely explored spill still rich with with uh with ... with undiscovered a ... a\nLord knows what's out there but uh when I was in the jungle I sat down to Medicaid and while I was meditating maybe an hour is my meditation I felt what I believed\nTo be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle\nCalling me I mean it was so strong that I had trouble breathing for my meditation and into a certain point I became a little bit tempered a beautiful because I I Will I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it\nSomehow ... and I wanted to share that causes if I Do believe that there's more out there ... and the more we explore the more we'll find just like you said if we put it into our minds that there's something there we will find that as opposed to\nShrug it off and not believing something is there what do you think about\nI Am so grateful for that comment on the question I appreciate ir supportive words and I think that one of the reasons that many traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is that a\nSpiritual leader or you know domestic who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered and that have the capacity to kind of take us\nOut with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey were ah they can help\nCalibrate that in you know keep you grounded in the experience but it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von to ah is no longer in this plane of experience but\nShe left this meditation where she took our identity into a bubble and the bubble left the body and went off somewhere and\nI Know that I got pretty lost in that moment and I thought if\nI didn't have the kind of grounding that I had I could see how some people\nCould be very frightened or destabilized by that\nAnd in fact there was a woman I'm Willoughby Britain who is a psychiatrist and it's really been looking at some of the difficulties surrounding meditation you know we think about it always has\nA really positive thing but it's also important to recognize that sometimes people can get into realms of experience that they have no way to navigate and so I'm very grateful for your question and your comments and\nI keep exploring it's a great adventure\nAnd indeed it is now a blow to school to Alice in wonderland Honolulu\nHello swat them to the show\nYes George farther and

Merrill Lynch loops Maryland where do you think of mediums\nThere's been some very interesting research some of my colleagues are not to lure 'em and others at the Institute of neurotic sciences we're looking at the possibility that when a medium is getting information that is accurate\nAs compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated the statement made by the medium\nAs having been accurate or correct that\nThe ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in I find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's\nThere's all kinds of mysteries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nVery Houdini spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with his mother he was successful\nI think there's been a lot of fraud there's been a lot in this direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so\nYou know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of formulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas was George ...\nHello George either a card or this or I was like a lot

difference a week makes before Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee it looked like a lose lose situation for Republicans abandon judge Kavanaugh and depressed the base ahead of the midterm elections or attack Dr Ford\nAnd read the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle\nOver judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red state that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nAll even though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe or his is accuser over him\nIn the red states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors so Republican voters\nHave seen their enthusiasm for the election go up or in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads and races were pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters\nWho believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly they believe that the media has not covered him a in partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations in and to understand\nWhat really happened thirty six years ago so that has at least for the time being [noise] been a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their\nDesire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous pulling the Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans are Republicans and a lot of cases\nSeem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities will really at risk\n... right so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on Tuesday as\nWell have a big one is we've seen in North Dakota where Heidi Heitkamp one of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Brett Kavanaugh uh her Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nA lawyer now that in the upper single digits in terms of his lead in the polling average is\nA you know that was a race it's been close it's been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot at taking Heitkamp down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely to vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen\nI think we've seen also a service ... has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill a declared fairly early that she was going to vote against Kavanaugh she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch\nA Josh Hawley the her Republican challenger the attorney general state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still there was a recent CNN poll that they'd have her up three but in the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrow lead\nA and this could be a a race to influence to abide by the Supreme Court matter\nA risk being with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boost to Republicans\nIn red state bits probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with the Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a a very political process and it's become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance and the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor a but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections\nWhere Democrats are already pretty energized because they just like President Trump they dislike what Republicans are doing a Washington there seems to them or like another power grab a by now Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote\nOr for Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump as the first place was that he wanted conservative judges they cared about who was controlling the Supreme Court they didn't want Antonin Scalia's seat in particular to go to a liberal ties Anthony Kennedy's seat to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does the river or a pretty big promise to many of the voters\nWho turned out for Trump and twenty sixteen and so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term election so that really is something that energizes both sides to a certain extent\nWith Jim Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner\nForce of the program is run the my recruiter you know was not smart and\nMaking the lottery the centerpiece of your retirement

which really are not part of the original NAFTA went into effect in Nineteen Ninety four\nWhich was before the Internet as we think of it today even existed so and then the agreement has been updated just to take\nAccount of changes in technology so that's a good thing but guess what all of those changes would have been in Trans Pacific partnership deal which also would have included Canada and Mexico which Trump pulled the United states out of\nYour just to Trump hater and like the pedal fake news isn't it [laughter]\nNo it's not true ah I run something called the Trump anonymous report card here at a Yahoo Finance a we're give ... were a setting that Trump's performance on the economy on a monthly basis we're currently give him a B for his handling of the economy uh that's pretty good um and what it would take to get up to an essay\nOr would probably be um better wage growth and better uh exports which are to the six factors we look at the Reagan we are saying what tropic present presiding over a stronger economy\nI I don't get into whether Trump deserves credit for that or not I usually say let the economy kind of does its own thing\nOr a truck but president either get credit or blame for itself yeah Trump is Trump is doing okay and the economy um but some of the things he's doing you have to say what is it really worth\nAll the controversy and disturbing drawn five oh we're going to tear up the north American free trade agreement that might cause a recession apparently we're not we're just gonna make some minor changes and call it a victory\nBig with Yahoo Finance columnist ... knew him and his piece is called Trump's strategy on trade rebranding how much of this bill might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different\nWhy I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution\nOr where he began earlier this year kind of like picking fights with everybody or he's picked by to Iran or he picks fights with everybody who encourage steel and aluminum in the United states that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico\nSo as we progress through these developments it does seem that should that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd and he's actually listening to trade experts who say look I'm we really don't have much trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either\nThe big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China\nYou need to make nice with everybody else these are basically ally so why are you picking fights with allies um when you read there had to put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement or a U.S MCA how how long is worth letting it go and then in analyzing it\nYeah years uh I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay I'm In ... first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries\nAnd that is not a given 'em if a turns out the Democrats take control of the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors they may just not wanting to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible we can be stuck with the old NAFTA for the indefinite future\nIs Rick Yahoo Finance columnist Rick

check out what they requested\nAnd I am ready to the\nOld one hundred US Senators are being given the opportunity to review the FBI supplemental background investigation report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nBut it may come down to what some key senators think of the report is with the Senate now but we feel very confident the White House says review the report and its firmly behind Kavanaugh as the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nAll the facts do not support the allegations levied a judge of character\nAnd so many of the facts actually support judge Kavanaugh's strong unequivocal that oil but\nTop Democrats say the investigation into Kavanaugh's have including sexual assault allegations isn't complete\nThe most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nWe are reiterating or call that the documents with proper rejection be made public but the answer\nHis report if not public and will likely never be and some of those decided Republicans have our regular you know in the report and say it appears there is just being the defendant named forward with a vote on Kavanaugh this weekend I'll be proud to vote or viruses nomination\nTomorrow Comey rubber now Washington it's Twenty one field jumbo Hannah news talking Kavanaugh and midterm elections\nWe're joined by Daniel Lipman the playbook editor at Politico dot com the political website and there's something interesting that has apparently been shown a blade or as a has been reported in a number of of Venus a Republican interest in the mid term election is up\nBut uh still I gather the the generic ballots are still show some edge to Democrats\nYeah there's still a lot of energy and the Democratic side and that's not subsided that's only going to get\nIncreased uh because of the left anger if Kavanaugh is confirmed as it looks like a he may be and so the Democrats are have that anger towards Trump mostly and so\nThis is a carried over to a trying to\nAh really showed trunk that uh he is not the only one who's in charge of the government that they want to have a check and balance a system that's how the competition works and parties traditionally lose many seats in the mid term as well\nAnd ironically I Believe the average in recent years a for a a a party that just taking over the presidency and their first midterm they tend to lose I Believe on average twenty four seats which just happens to be the current margin but I'm not mistaken so uh that's certainly cutting maligned fine\nYeah and uh if you talk to some Republicans I think that they could lose ... and so this is a\nReal a blue wave that seems to be building and even though the a Republican or a little more energetic advocate Kevin ...\nThat may not hold for a whole month or without him in the news and also the uh uh a lot of the Republican easy as it is in red states already so not in the purple or blue\nOr states where are you know say a look at New York where you're expected or welcome party is expected to lose some faith and you know across the country in states that are not just rock or read so in other words or\nRepublican string tends to be in areas where they don't need it as much\nYeah it's like a you know Democrats are getting more ethic and math it's great but uh that doesn't uh really going to move the needle\nYou know and I I look at at the the outcome or let's assume that as we speak or that it does go as it seems to be trending and that is the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nSo Democrats would lose going into the midterm election November sixth and would that make them dispirited and disheartened discouraged or would it make the mad as hell\nI come on the side that as I don't make them more encouraged to go to the poll because er and er they want to get an ethnically and\nIt almost feels like the country is getting into two different countries too partisan countries because of a many different styles trends than even saw Brett\nKavanaugh

have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney gray Jarrett opposite those legal analysts author of the number one\nBestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was done I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant a week with uncommon eloquence and shown reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important that at the outset\nCollins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I that's part of what she is a\nA was re counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion just to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and set in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers no into civil cases is called er preponderance of the evidence and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate pristine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said show under penalty of perjury so she present I\nThat was probably the most impressive I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both tar and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness which I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve\nA serious response from the Republicans and I'm often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did league does that a grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold here now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme\nCourt but certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins each wrote some dignity back to the process it certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know as a student to Senator Bill Cohen from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... thinks in that same vein\nYou're absolutely right what she said was so critically important again it emphasized the language of article ... section to a presidential have the power with the advice and content that's what's been lost in all of this\nAlso critically important that you emphasize the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this debate wall of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial they\nConcept in American law that kind of fundamental at rock American principle that's the way we go about our business\nWe don't assume based on allegations of a man or woman has built up a career is guilty was important for that um I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have seemed to have your by United States senators and has been the on the tail that I never in my wildest perhaps naive\nDreams couldn't imagine with possible people who simply don't know anything about\nProfessor Ford or judge Kavanaugh who ... carved out a position you were a bad guy if you didn't wear black to Columbia Law school during the Kavanaugh hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale he's a future lawyers um so I worry about where we go from here in the last one I Want to make on this is\nThe very same people who are limb fasting the president for daring to criticize\nCrooked FBI agents we've been proven to be ... et cetera those people for whom stroke was a hero or now criticizing the FBI if this wasn't a fairer thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was that he was a sex offender now is not that but they don't like is the meter because he took it personally when\nIt 'cause they don't know they don't like it temperament I was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gang rapist of teenage girls I I don't I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe but uh it looks\nLike this goes forward it looks like capital has the votes that will support his nomination and that this will conclude tomorrow barring any unforeseen last minute you know insanity but\nI Will tell you we one issue we've got to deal with and I'm I'm I got to say goodbye to both of you thank you both for weighing in on this Lindsey Graham is coming up but I Will say one thing that we have got to deal with how they what\nHas now become it is a national disgusting personal blood Jennings a disgrace and they have ruined this man's reputation in Eighteen days with zero corroboration\nIt's a national disgrace\nShe knew that he had a good sense of what if needed or fried yet not a single person has come forward to say that they weren't the one\nWho drove her home or wherever in the car with her that night and professor Ford also indicated that even though he's lab that small Catherine sick to some people are rapidly and\nWithout saying goodbye and straw nine of them call to the next day or ask her dad why she laughed is she okay not even her closest friends ms ...\nMy fervent how is that Brett Kavanaugh well we're\nLess than that division in the Supreme Court so that we had\nFewer five four and says and and so that's how like confidence in our judiciary and our highest\nCourt is read or Mr President I Will vote for judge Kaplan\nAnd with that Susan Collins announcing I think one of the well I'm going to be honest I thought it was the most powerful speech\nIn recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen\nIt was Thoreau it was sober it was smart it was Bob Bullock was comprehensive\nShe went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system how she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I I'm frankly I we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that for you far below the audience because it was something that I wanted everybody to hear\nThis was a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country you cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeon\nYou can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWe're really realize today is I don't know her well\nShe doesn't do a lot of television is not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\n... the the systematic she walking every American through her decision making process and frankly it was ...\nIt was spectacular nothing shorter spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her country on this issue and\nShe had it ... it was obvious she missed nothing she followed every single solitary detail of this process did all the work\nYou would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged as they've been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate all's at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and you'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I better than than radio Thirty years I'm a\nTomorrow I start my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\n[noise] well uh you know I'm I'm In a political\nSystems is deteriorating\nI think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe said at the biggest winner of the speeches to the judiciary because her as a wholesale attack on the independence of the ... one at all costs what you saw that day was a person embracing the rule of law not the rule of the mob what you saw today was a woman\nNot being intimidated what you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being safe a strong woman which you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward\nBut this is as close to McCarthyism as I Hope it never witness in my life and if anybody turned it around it was senator Collins\nOr you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came\nWhen they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh I don't think any of us will forget anytime soon the things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that\nRemember the accusation by Julie sweat neck was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that\nThat judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug in girls lining up in halls gang raping them and it happens frequently\nAnd I know that some people brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night\nHow was one supposed to act if you're innocent to the charge of drugging teenage girls and participating in\nGang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but I Would think if you're innocent it is one of deep anger and and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody thought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\nWell yeah I think I I think most Americans saw a man who was\nFighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this went through a logical explanation based on a calendar that very few people in the world Cape except him and his dad\nAnd just a warning to everybody know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life I'm not evil and I think he reacted consistent would be an innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out\nIt was breaking news allegation number three at a very new and\nEvil level right\nSo I saw it and I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party or where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less ten that\nMade no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah

with him and the Democrats were exposed\nThese voters are now are outraged that the Democrats would put to lead hit on and try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their sons their their their brother\nAnd say this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it and they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans are coming
