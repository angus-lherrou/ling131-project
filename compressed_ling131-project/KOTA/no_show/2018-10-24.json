suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know\nLeading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well somebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt\nI don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan her\nYou know it ought not be prices precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nSo we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home in ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros his home in Westchester New York suspicious packages sent the Debbie Wasserman Schultz was officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus yet in their face holder kick them they go low we checked on\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them once and for us we win you know back then what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know\nKnow first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had a similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda well you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought of the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago\nMaybe people born is alarms there because from the minute the news broke this morning the media's gone wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder's another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's\nDefense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve ... nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such her was it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nIts engine about left or right when when we found out that the that still leaves the shooter happen to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say see I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters you're not responsible for that\nBut the media today in there for their reaction to this is all over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap part isn't\nIt just it they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox News talk radio you got to be the reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of extremist brand new but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio\nYou know there's jackass maybe needs to go back and hear my history because I've got the tapes when Obama was president the you know whenever there was any threat to the president when the guy walked in the White House and we've got to protect our president doesn't matter what their politics are\nWe've gotta protect all our politicians retired politicians\nAnd they purposely do this for cheap political points my answer is I Want everybody say everybody needs to stop and the silence there's been violence it has been from the left\nAs we've watched women repeatedly run out of restaurants and people you know confronted in public or marching orders given by leaders of the Democratic party not the Republican Party\nIs this this is it's so outrageous who is this ban Collins\nIs eat you know I should I feel like suing somebody like him and ramming the tapes that I have defending people and telling people to never act like there's a write up his you know what an a and a quarter off because he's a liar\nAnd listen you know that uh I Love my pillow I fall asleep faster stay asleep longer\nIn the states I'm you know it's a\nOne of the things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable\nAnd that is this rush to judgment now that we have\nThese the what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this was going to be vetted out in the day it's become the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing event at the White House\nAnd he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as media outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians\nThey getting suspicious packages in the mail\nUm we know that it does happen to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to done junior and his family we know that it has happened just writes letters were sent to Trump and Madison ray and has just three weeks ago and\nI frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIs Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere or it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day\nAnd not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen stop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy a room watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD their their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all and we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nThe president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest that absolute priority\nThat the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expands in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his\nStatement condemning they agree just rats butt cetera et cetera and and mores coming\nBut that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously almost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox\nNews for over a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush to joke we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did that\nWhen I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been\nTone deaf and final into what has been unfolding now in this country for a month how many women have been confronted and restaurants movie theaters how many times has this happened with you know the chanting in the restaurants with with politicians in their\nWives even this weekend with McConnell happened twice there Ted Cruz over a conspiracy TV MSNBC there just despicable insinuating that suspicious packages can be tied back to the Trump himself and that the intended recipient of all been criticized by the president\nYou got to be kidding me is this how twisted let's just take the rhetoric of of who they are every day just last night alone I played a bunch of tapes of you know lower thirds of the president he's a liar he says is he's a lawyer fraud this\nI'm Sorry the president flat out lie same Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election you get the life he changes his story again except for going to get for the eventually the president thinks you're stupid the president seems people are stupid were officially in their parents and in fact framed on President Trump tried to play to his base with outright false\nHe's not even trying to hide and twice in the morning just putting all out there he's running a lot of lines about non whites all you hear\nEvery single day from the mainstream media lies about why ... ... look this is every election season you get it\nAnd we did have an incident if you recall when Steve school lease another's the shooting took place on the ball field\nAnd I actually I remember saying and I asked my staff to go back and find out what did I say when we found out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting that nearly killed Steve ... was a Bernie Sanders supporters is what I set\nOut I I I'm not going to do with the left does year\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say because most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill the Republicans and Bernie Sanders was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe there's so much Ryan\nMcCarthy and ... and this individual this the same way that we are now getting the information on that you just shared by his own and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because he was a Sanders supporter supposed but what\nThey want but you know what that may do it I don't blink Bernie Sanders of course not they would they would blame us yes of course I have to do what I Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh and the and Obama's any mommy and you know they got out there where I met him up and around and say\nWell this is because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric\nThat they can get away with it and they get a free pass nobody doesn't matter if they do it so here's what you have today right here in Washington DC\nMeans a packages or at least the people who's a who's packages had been addressed that while they have this in common they are Democrats a for a affiliated with democratic causes\nHurricane wheeler came ashore on Mexico's Pacific coast last night and quickly wound down to a big rainstorm which is now centered over the south central United States stretching from Texas to Nebraska report Adrian bart is more on the storms effects in Mexico\nRepresented as clean up about an hour's drive south of moderate lines that they were glad they heated government warning and ate in sheltered\nWhile hurricane ... It's MORNING local official described the math the storm knocked down ... street and the wall of mine at home that's how far it did not caught casual each according to Mexico's top federal protection essential\nThat caravan of would be migrants from Central America continues the wind its way through southern Mexico correspondent Adriana did\nThey are moving at roughly I pay twenty five mile today an ad that paints that are going to raise the rent for as hell at least made that sound are now the element of of course we have a little faster than the women with children so it's kind of the fact that the flames her in the coming weeks\nWho won that one point five billion dollar mega millions Jack Potter single winning tickets sold in South Carolina where winters can remain anonymous state lottery director Hogan brown are more\nTo stab at that as a policy simply because it's it's very intrusive what happens in someone can be hurt someone can be threaten people come out of the woodwork and they won't help yeah and so yeah [laughter]\nIt's their choice is the winters choice they can decide to expose themselves to publicly they work\nOn Wall street another bloodbath with the dial down six hundred seven points and the NASDAQ all three twenty nine four and a half percent yesterday ... down eighty five ... CBS News\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps and your legs in feet used their works relief fast acting foam get there were released today and the pain relief ... what's your local pharmacy or their works relief dot com\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to manage share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family it's five hundred dollars a month\nTwo days perhaps\nUm but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here I Would predict given that they found these devices and they got that without that they that uh I predict\nThey're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspects with the next two or three days what makes you think that Bernie\nListen when you get nature stuff but you know you blow to pieces gets harder to collect the evidence that you could send screw up who works with a machine right so now you have a package itself\nUh the mail or the stamps writing the device looms side they're going to break this stuff down\nWhere and how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you don't want Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for new mailing system is different areas and and there's so many packages loose who's a nuisance of benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the Amazon gene okay it's going to\nDemocrats it's going to a liberal CNN might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head they're first suspect would be well might be some radical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them and they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is that devices are now we don't want to get a straight face acceptable in polite conversation incentivize is violence on public officials and anyone who does\nUm is a moron in a Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thank you and you're right it it did take them a long time but remember what the Unabomber\nHe was a little more tactically of a strategic re devious he would send those bomb and there'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop a new kind of a you know let's say way to put those in construct those bombs\nTogether was very difficult with then they're basically you know ... nations whoever this was he may have done that so it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me that belief shown that\nThis person or persons wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices to CNN was addressed that John Brennan\nWho doesn't work at the end I mean it's not hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out to John Brennan and that you know it'd be the comedy is not a CNN\nPicture if this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were ... enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility you think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone new or a group of people are caught I Hope they are\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come up in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down slow down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday with Soros right and then you had a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the attraction of ... in New York City\nWhen you got all these rich just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false waters of the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that\nBut um you know I I agree with that I think we can a couple of days or they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here um and that's been captured\nWhat is your first be looking for some radical fringe we often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and I've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians\nOr could it be in ... I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of\nThe school shooting and absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that show on and that is exactly what they discovered\nThat a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically got into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see based\nI going to have an obviously have an adult size these devices but having seen what the press is put out and what's in the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices that the foremost someone either\nDidn't know what they were doing and weren't sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God or\nThey somehow wanted to get caught like we saw on that bombing in in in Austin where did you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they did they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre up this whole cases very bizarre even look John even look at something like the packaging\nI notice the oversight typing and the pictures the media is put out about these device\nI mean you're basically telegraphing to anyone who's done this kind of stuff like me and the commission or we have some experience in the space\nLook this is packages suspicion here's this big oversized hype this something odd about then\nWe're orange commission and where where would you where would you start\nWill listen to this one other thing that that we haven't mentioned and that is or what if it's a hoax I Wonder if not one of these devices are real\nWhat if they're not real at all in this person lunatic to wherever it is I'm just wondering Mr commotion and intimidate a lot is a good possibility given uh what what Dan saying that the the amateur a look of the packages\nI Would ah you know I'd be skeptical and uh I wait on the uh the outcome of the ... and the the the people to see what they fly and in the devices themselves and then when the market\nIs really saying is what we should do in all cases it never rush to judgment and that's what you're saying I agree with what I agree with\nYou let the investigators do their job you you've got the best of the last one in the joy ... force in New York City has been the best in the country all consists of the FBI are a number of federal agencies including the secret service\nATF got the NYPD and the uh in the New York state police can let them do their job and let them do their investigation and they're going to wind down a flight of the ...\nHundreds of thousands of families will be ripped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and wrong and the thousands of American businesses will lose hardworking employees\nAnd the argument them as the president is Americans don't want to do the work wage drug tests\nAmerican workers to do the work was the president not is a crime in many instances that's not\nTrue in my view from the ... the end of the DACA program was some eight hundred thousand\nYoung people in the trailer and most importantly presidential act\nIn the modern history of this country I cannot think of one thing which is ... and more cruel\nIt's amazing by the way to hear the tape the leaders of the Democratic party force that was then and Obama's years what it was politically expedient but what have they evolved into\nThe party of sanctuary city sanctuary states the party of open borders the party of lawlessness the party of oh we've got to show Kamala Harris we've got to show the caravan compassionate ... what what does that mean we're\nJust going to allow Fifteen thousand maybe more people to just walk right across our border totally define the rule of law\nOur sovereignty our constitution no respect for borders and and what we will take on the burden of the the financial burden for health care and education in some cases maybe criminal justice um we're paying billions every year now\nAnd the point at some point you know when you really think about however this ends up\nThis is a group of people that have made a decision to break American laws violate our sovereignty disrespect our constitutional republic if you allow this to stand there is no law and order there's total chaos\nWe're following that story and of course the other top story of the day and that is\nA individuals' CNN and Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and Obama's in Clinton's being targeted with suspicious packages and what is the media is quick response blame Trump Fox News and talk radio\nSo predictable having ignored\nAll of the ... in the area insane rhetoric\nThat has now we've been chronicling for months get in their faces you you create a crowd you didn't you follow them into restaurants and grocery stores in department stores and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nOr just this week at a Boulder sent through the office of Kevin McCarthy the

actually eating ripping food off the table throwing it out the door and creating a hostile environment all one Democrat now one\nHas spoken up as Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders Mitch McConnell had Cruz and his wife and so many others run out of restaurants by their lunatic minion friends\nAre because of the hospital environment that has been created by the rhetoric of people like Maxine\nNo Spartacus Booker Hillary you can't be civil with them Eric Holder kicked them and even Brock Obama back as they are and submit their Burgess out the tears Sean Hannity up getting the debt in their face this\nThis is their rhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field in ... nearly lost his life\nUm and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters it turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that support him you know decided to become violence\nOutrageous what they do they do this every time they've been stairs silence has been definitely\nIn recent months and days\nOr anyway Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action\nAnd also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris Kobach is back with us and uh he has penned a piece on them migraine caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert\nIn immigration and ah by the way it's been very successful and what he's doing and uh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas was a big win that you pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you'd be a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush as across that border as in as one we don't have any problem with a choice we will have to arrest them\nThat will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get her to we had a wall up right now for Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had\nMore states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens or we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens meanwhile you've got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more show you if you took federal and state response or the feds have to build the wall and they have to stop handing out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in but it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSpicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government that they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling aren't capable of doing so uh what should America's response\nWell I think America's response in his act with the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons or to either harm us or that they you know but there's a writing in the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official\nIs to protect his people and the president's made very clear and and the one thing I send to the other day that so much on I Want to be clear your grade with me I Know Christ will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump\nDon't temp temp because he's warned the Mexican government he's warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable and they need to do their job stop this from happening\nUm and I I guess I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action\nIf you don't reverse course\nLet me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I and I really believe\nPresident Trump steam Dorsey CBS News Washington jeopardize reports packages had been sent to at least six different targets\nIsn't something that is quickly

Claire McCaskill the bony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the motors in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project baritone voice is CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [noise] hey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in her Washington DC campaign office\nOr speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in the battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff\nOne thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lied to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people have done it the ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nOr there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... have the same user and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on on the wall this big\nPoster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff say so it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states\nThey have to mislead them toward a moderate voters and play to the progressive base\nWell we just have them on tape saying and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but she's going to be settled liberal once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that you're not going to run again so because as what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again\nSo she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that you can't talk about right now\nSo it's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that our party is older they don't want me to say if they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's good\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that well that's what we do it very tossed we confirms suspicions and we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first and I'm a conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and\nAnd nearing at me I just have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderate they have to woo the moderates and that and they could only make one choice one\nChoice it's line isn't a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there was an open contempt hatred and the feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well even\nThough it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate her on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNo I Know and it it it it her way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nThan how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's for it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to miss represent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week\nKnow I think well it should have happened in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know um\nThe court without really being young we were planning our common humanity being governor\nWhile many Americans like right on me a long line they're going to be true in a while

telling me for\nMonths and months that he was a racist at a bigot and homophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler at that his followers were no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people really making people believe these stories and this narrative that they're trying to push so

you've seen this and what she sat me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking the Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this it's a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign\nTrail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch the compilation\nIs that this is a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he imitating someone who was caught a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now Sean but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really\nRealized
