not that the or is not yours isn't but you know you went through a whole series of things to say basically back in the eighties when the Reagan Administration the Republicans really rewrote the rules of American Capitalism\nI'm into really significant ways stopping in the air force one of the Sherman anti trust act busting up unions you know doing it we were were workers' rights ... starting the right word shift of the of the Supreme Court all these things the basically bay and the billionaires who funded them\nInitiated a multi trillion dollar I think it's for fourteen Fifteen to a trillion dollar transfer of wealth from the middle class and working people in the United states to the top one percent\nAnd in the process used that as a rationalization most was you know the old to Santa Claus theory I'm you know from the seventies so for you know the run up massive debt when you're ... when Republicans were an office in them scream about it when Democrats come into office or they'll cut Social Security and things\nAnd then and then they they use the transfer of wealth and those changes in tax code code to justify the guardian of the social safety net\nAnd now the billionaires who benefited from all those are stepping in and saying we'll be the new social safety net\nIt's ... if that's exactly what you're describing that sounds like be a it it sounds like a virtual the

that was Tom you you've you've decided stolen my uh\nMy book tour stump speech that is exactly right and the reality is you know many of your listeners will will know this expression like a Fox guarding and how the way I often describe the story you just told very well is we're in a hand\nIn this analogy the American people and the the the hen used to have a bar and the guard with the government wasn't perfect but it was you know\nWorked to protect that said it it can always do better and\nIn the Nineteen seventies and then Nineteen eighties as you say of Fox came around and decided that the guard was a threat and that Fox's business interests and decided to the palmetto\nStarting the seventies and all the way that they needed to take the reins got an they needed to fight for their interest and and have the chamber of commerce libertarian view of the world more dominant in political life and they succeeded\nThey got Reagan at them they got ... they got Bill Clinton in Nineteen Ninety six to declare that the era of big government has all but um\nAs the revolution succeeded\n... they basically the Fox that the guard and the leg government had less money less capability fewer people to do things became less capable of solving those social problems meanwhile business flourished because it was not being you know police and then the the hens are unguarded\nBecause the Fox has been banned in the Fox is that the garden like and and the Fox comes around in the hands of what a shame your unguarded what a shame so tragic allow me to step in and

access senior email could put your private information or risk\nStation all basically all the stuff that that keeps America America\nIs being cut back and being cut back radically was a singular exception of of our military\nNumber two in order to fund this tax cut literally every penny of it was borrowed it to six trillion dollar tax cut over a decade the first trillion and a half dollars and the first two years\nWhich we're seeing right now all of that as being funded by buying treasuries it's going to have to be paid back with interest the interest is going to be another trillion dollars and that hurts our country in fact that may provoke a crisis for our country\nOr we're at the point now with over ... trillion dollars in debt where if interest rates go up to point and they certainly have in the past and the seventies you know there are those are the prime was all the way up to around eight or nine percent\nYou know right now it's in the neighborhood of two percent if interest rates go up another two points the interest on the national debt the annual payments in interests will be greater than everything that we pay to fund the Pentagon all of our wars and everything\nAnd that's mind boggling and it's not good and it's not healthy\nAnd the number three because of that massive debt and what I just described\nYou know the the ... when Democrats come into office the Republicans are going to be screaming okay it's time to end Social Security is trying to and long term unemployment benefits of science and food stamps assigned to end any support for college when I went to college you know when I went to and as you briefly a back in the Nineteen sixties and Lansing community colleges well\nEighty percent of the cost of college it cost me but I my recollection is a hundred and fifty dollars a term to go to MSU\nEighty percent of the cost of college in the Nineteen sixties was paid for by state and local governments and the university twenty percent was paid for by tuition\nAs a consequence of Reagan's policy changes particularly those who are championed by bill Bennett is racist secretary of education now eighty percent of the cost of education is paid for with tuition only twenty percent is paid for by government so what we've had is this massive shift away from\nA society a society for all of us were anybody could you know I'm having you know my parents were not wealthy my dad worked in a tool and dye shopping he could not afford to move me through college I but I but I was able to work my way through college the extent that I did I I old I'm only got kicked out but\nYou know having dropped out I suppose is a more technically correct but\nOn the bottom line is I was able to do that because on a minimum wage jobs I worked as a as a as a waiter uh excuse me I I was a waiter for one day when the when the waitresses went on strike but as as a dishwasher and Bob's big boy introvert drove in East Lansing and across the street at the Exxon Mobil station I changed tires and pumped gas\nAnd you know for as I recall two dollars and thirty cents an hour or something like that with a minimum wage part time job uh there was a little more fulltime in the summer I could pay for college\nAnd then it because that's how things were\nThe complete change in all of these things right you know making it impossible to go to college making healthcare massively more expensive shifting everything out of not for profit in the for profit\nAll of that was predicated or a or B that whole that whole horrible you know chain of horrible the Republican Party or in the last year the of the uh the Bush administration\nOr ... you know cutting long term unemployment benefits from three years out of one year and then cutting it again down to six months um all of that was because they're cutting taxes\nOn if you if you were to go as I did live in Germany for a year where a somebody with your level of income you know well over a hundred thousand dollars would be paying as much as forty percent of your income in taxes\nYou would have free healthcare you would have free college in fact your kids would get a stipend when they go to college you'd have one of the best public education systems in the world you would have highway systems in road systems that are so well maintained that you can travel a hundred and thirty miles an hour on the freeway or you would have\nA ... you know I can go on and on right um and and you would have a much higher minimum wage the fact of the matter is the the other the other argument that I Would make Spencer and I've made this before but you know it's worth repeating in fact I've read it written op eds about this you can easily find them\nIs that tax cuts affect there's two different categories of people in the United states in terms of income there's people who have control over their income and there's people who don't have control over their income\nAnd if you got if you're a wage earner if you're getting a salary and you're working for somebody else you don't have control over your income broadly speaking I mean you can petition for a raise or whatever but you basically don't have control over your income\nIf you are an entrepreneur or if you own your own business or if you are a very very wealthy person or I'm a CEO in a large corporation or he basically control your own income you can choose how much money you get\nSo for it when you look at the labor market if you take out of the labor market that top one or two percent maybe as much as three percent of Americans who actually have some control over their income\nFor that group of people when taxes are cut their income actually goes up\nBut your employer and let's say that you're working for acne company 'cause I don't want to ask the on the air who who's paying you a hundred and twenty grand a year but let's say that you're a lawyer\nOr he asked me a knows that you just got a tax cut that you know a thousand dollars is pretty and consequential and it's also it's also temporary so it's probably not going to cause a huge dislocation but let's say that you got a tax cut that was worth twenty thousand dollars a year\nNow before with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income you're probably paying around thirty percent taxes so you're probably taking home at the end of the day around eighty five grand am I Am I right more or less Seventy to eighty grant okay so now you're employed and your employer knows we're willing to work\nFor a take home pay of Seventy five to eighty thousand dollars a year they know that because you're doing it right\nAnd now as a result of a tax cut your taking home Ninety five or a hundred thousand dollars a year now your employer knows your work for Seventy five\nSo over time what's your employer going to do Spencer they're going to do one or two things they're either going to cut your wages directly and but that's sometimes very difficult to do or they're going to make your job unpleasant or uncomfortable or whatever and when you finally quit that job and you get replaced you're gonna get replaced by somebody who's making twenty thousand dollars a year less than you are\nBecause they're than taking the same take home pay and you you have established that the market for your particular job\nIs worth eighty five grand a year take home pay so ... and and you can see this by looking at the tax graphs and versus the wage graphs and I'm Talking wages so we're talking a hundred percent people who don't have control over their income all going all the way back in ...\nTwenty every time because the Nineteen twenty hurting to drop the top tax rate from Ninety One percent or twenty five percent in Nineteen thirty four ah FDR raised a back up to Ninety One percent in\nNineteen sixty seven LBJ dropped down to sixty ... down to Seventy four percent and then in Nineteen eighty three Reagan dropped down to twenty five percent and then it's all the flood of backup\nEvery single time if you look at a three hour window\nEvery single time working people's wages are caught\nOver the next three to five years working people's wages decline for the reason I just described to you\nCivil every time working people's wages go up you know again let's go back to your employers ... taken home eighty five grand and let's say that the Democrats come in and they raise your taxes by twenty thousand dollars a year share now only taking I'm sixty five grand\nAnd you're going to go to your employer and say you know I'm not willing to do this job for sixty five grand to you know and and and nobody else in the labor market is because this is an eighty five grand take home pay job\nI'm a Pompeo that's what I think you have ... he's\n... I mean palm panel has moderated his position somewhat now that he actually has power when he was just a ... you know a Republican congressman and could just basically shoot off his mouth whenever he wanted a you know he was pretty radical but uh you know he's he's starting to behave like you know a reasonable person but\nBut ... not not not a chance you know at all\nAnd then uh the two things also you know a one was the statement about matters\nAnd then he bypassed issue of making fun of Dr Ford and you know of course I didn't do that to you know that's not what I was doing et cetera [noise] to me uh he started to backtrack on ... show gay but then again of course today he quote you know talk to the gang feels assured you know king had nothing\nBehind but the king probably didn't even know I mean the king is in his age he's he's he's half senile he is and this is why NBS is running the country\nHe surrendered his power I mean if you want to ask who did it I mean everybody is saying it was a mama bin ... the guy who's actually running the country\nAre you know why didn't Trump that want to talk to him as a ... to ... talk to him two days before this happened and by the way when you're in Christian talk to NBS two days before this happened did he give him top secret information that allowed him to do this\nIn your in your in Christian or give a MBA stopped is you know the the last time these two guys hung out together about three days later and B.

savings for a family it's five hundred dollars a month I think what you could do that\nI mean this is all part of a wide campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people of Tennessee in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us he's the founder project baritone\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job yeah Sean this is\nPattern and you know we released the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by bumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's officer all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and doing other things afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces when this guy Glenn Winfrey won a McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to have to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it and that's the that's the ... it's that this is the other guy next arose field organizer tells us he says\nA quote people just can't know unquote in the ... have the same views no I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone and I said Nick why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\n... some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposed\nAnd you don't want no one's gonna say agree with that point they don't have to know why they have to lie if they want to win and ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of peace in the honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think that everybody on they're showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat but in the house you're voting for ...\nIt'd be a vote for Claire McCaskill or British than or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's who they're going to vote to be their leader\nWill you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery was the star war when it came to those things but that's a shrinking group of people and\nAnd people like Claire McCaskill have to stay in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead and again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily a villain that's I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but\nThey're just telling the truth so it's going to be very interesting to see is British and after we play those tapes on your radio last week British when I talk to local media to the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well al these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffer said well they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't actually worked for\nAnd the guy ... this guy brown who is the the democratic spokesperson for the British and campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologize\nFor misleading people about our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's going to respond now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded\nHe's tweeted out this video\nUm he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is\nBecause we're going to get him on the program or later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know the one of the questions are going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was gonna say that McCaskill has in this video it's me and she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban and we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he's had semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about in Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed\nWell I again I think that you're rocking the world the big state Senate candidates and exposing them but who they really are look\nI've been saying in explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigation that help them the deep they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to do first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigation impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice they're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes\nI think expose what's going on in every congressional and Senate district except you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've got a couple of big people are already\nWe've got we've got our question to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have gotten more missions advice but there's you know it's people are already early voting and some of these states and they just this is the bigger issue is\nLike I said the last week or the few days ago this is about don't lie to the people I ask this guy next roast when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to lie y y ers are politics so broken but that becomes a tradition you having to win just the honest because voters aren't gonna in Tennessee this guy just lost\nThere's a new poll out New York times poll on these down fourteen points after our video it doesn't help you when people find this stuff out but some of these senators Sean only going to run for one term so they say like Heidi Heitkamp\nWas the name of it I mean yeah they said well I mean that's the point the lie to get the one term and I'd say right there James O'Keefe\nUp project Vera times dot com you can see the videos we've linked it on Hannity dot com\nUm and the big question I'm going to ask him when we get back is is they're going to be more\nUm when we come back to the bottom of the have are we going to compare the Obamacare ACA versus direct primary care and what is the answer to the to the big problem um health care and we're going to look at the the media and corruption as it relates to they don't even want to talk about Stormy Daniels all anymore because stormy lost and has to pay\nThe court costs and the lawyer legal movies of Donald Trump's nobody's reporting it a quick break we'll come back we'll continue with James O'Keefe Maria ...\nGoing to have them building maybe we can\nSmartest thing you can

you like your plan you can keep your plan if you're happy with what you got nobody is changing\nTheir fate because it helps my than\nShaving table and because I'm a woman that's gonna be a seat at that table and that's for me is very important and Hillary Clinton had won and had the shot if they had to the table I I'm not ... I I'm not the only thing that now I Do believe that\nNone of accidents indispensable but I think I'm the best person for the job and I won't let him in public can add which are\nFlooding is each district can I can do whatever you have to just ...\nAnd say whatever you need to say just lie as much as you need to lie and tell her good buddy even though they lost their doctors their plans and they paid a fortune\nIn many cases over a hundred two hundred percent more without their doctor without their protections without their plan but there's always one big pyramid scheme from the get go that's all it was from day one\nLike your doctor you keep your doctor you keep your plane no\nNow the one thing that the Democrats are trying to do and talk about is health care which is somewhat bizarre to me because that is not exactly worked out for anybody\nWhat we have is you know the the the AC a which is the Obamacare what you've lost with the A. C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before many lost the doctors that they loved\nTaxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate would tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect a pain for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution ski\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about outlets MD Dr Josh ...\nAnd Dr Lee as gross is modeled now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all\nIf you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine addict greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nIt's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas empty and Dr Lee as grows president of doctors for patient care I'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean Everytime you talk about it are folks will start bringing and we've got regular patients to failed you don't have a lot of them too right\nWe we have a you know uh our own panel there and yeah we're fulltime families additions but no you nailed it\nWell I mean so and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people like me\nAnd I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well or which has happened it occasionally in my life\nAnd these guys you know I I mean I pay them and they take my insurance is but they do it as a more of a friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah at types plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley styles of\nA Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headache the hassle of the middle man so that now medicines are penny a pill now you can call text email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI told this is now implementing how many places did you get this finally up and running around the country ... I don't think you're explaining it in detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and its a\nFlat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits get free tele medicine's so you can call ...

the wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out there and let their doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist and say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nTo gauge and in the matter pump able to travel to turkey tomorrow to me with officials there to discuss the case we're not much more on the ... disappearance on tonight's CBS

and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress those or group formed by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... but very revealing the Maxine Waters says\nThey keep telling me not to say it I think keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nHiding their agenda we learned that in this project ... tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration at all you know a sanctuary attacked pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it and Democrats and strategist prepared the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their part Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have that's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes these pretty authentic he made promises when he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent an unemployment below four\nPercent rights or something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC it today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate evaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal you just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with capital as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that Nobel rats\nViews when was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you're going to the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive\nHey that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again if Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have\nA if it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like you didn't two thousand sixteen but again a ... till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate but then I have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocked me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now\nHe's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with I'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at these other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this was widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe Manchin in the Senate\nAnd and the Senate and in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red states Texas Red state tendency red standing\nBy the way up I'm going to ease up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember a federal ... more money than any cat on my guys are eight million dollars I mean he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know I I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration as Republicans in Eighteen but\nYeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could of unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house given the history Eighteen or the last twenty midterms\nI have gone against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten so I was thinking you know I ... I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that the Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press\nThat President Trump has received the Republicans I've received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think the fact that you're you've hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality\nAnd we saw that in the capital hearings and we have seen a post Kavanaugh hearings and you know when you say as Maxine Waters it did about cabinet members and and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I spent the\nNight and it for a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some hackers on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nYou're not allowed to stay there ... All right stay right there will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill or will come back and also the stormy stormy networks are a little bit quiet except for the president's tweet we'll get into that when we get back eight hundred nine four one showing your calls in the final half hour\nOf the program we got an awesome Hannity tonight we hope you'll join us nine Easter were going to prove a point to you with all the videotape about how bad\nWe're talking here we are going on\nI feel like I Know you've been in my living room so many times and been run around with me in the car [laughter]\nWell they want to know the truth you really do know me you know the other thing I've always said if you really can't fake it for three our four hours a day I mean he may on TV you hear me on the radio I mean I Can't just\nWe don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain who you really are especially that's why they call radio or warms the media\n... you're exactly right you're exactly right look shutting the reason I called was I was listening on your program yesterday and he played a clip from Hillary Clinton's speech and in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility in this country used to elect Democrats\nAnd then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion she's telling us telling the American people\nThe only way you don't have any these impressed shut up shut up if Democrats\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand\nSince the day Donald Trump\nWon the left in this country doesn't quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob and some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera all of this remember Maxine Waters said if you see them\nGet a crowd get a crowd and you can front and you follow them into department stores the gas station and restaurants and you tell them and I wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen and the fact\nThat the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest why we see it in the project baritone videos of ... we ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters Tet said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the sheet Bernie Sanders the get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian stop the eight to ... and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with\nUnverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThere's just who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said how we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cuts and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad Warren building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nAll the you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when\nMaybe they lose the house you lose the house then all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump Kate and investigations and possible impeachment\nThat the agenda that's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people money you know there's a lot at stake\nFor the Democrats rely on people of of willow information they rely on propaganda and putting things out there and can be using the that's the way it is\nLet me tell you what it is they they've got one play ball they're the party of smear slander discouragement racist sexist massage in is Dina phobic homophobic Islamic phobic dirty air water kill children killed ... it's the same play ball it's never changed on Thirty years in radio it's never\nGoing to change when they did get power for eight years with Obama you saw what they did with it it didn't improve the lives of anybody it left many Americans behind the worst economy in modern times was Brock Obama's so\nYou know I it's amazing that they don't want to talk about while I'm of tax cuts I'm working now they want the crumbs back in ... well healthcare never worked out for anybody but they want to keep me that's just ... but are there focuses the hate Trump investigating from non stop\nAll right um but I looked on the other side I'll be blunt\nYou know if three weeks from tomorrow it come on the air and say well you know we're going to be stuck with Nancy Pelosi you didn't get out you didn't vote you know what\nSurvive it will fight we're not going to stop\nBut it would be so much better and so much easier for all of us and especially the forgotten men and women they just get no foothold now in terms of jobs and opportunities for themselves and their families\nYou know none of it's
