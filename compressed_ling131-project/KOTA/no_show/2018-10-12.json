I was watching the stock market defy called you see all I'm there between bom bah maturity and these tax cuts within five years we are going to be over a trillion dollars that cotton milk budgets and\nAll and of course Donald Trump's blaming the feds today for raising them right in Obama for not paying bills when you guys get the house are you guys ready to tackle this debt because I'll tell you what this is they say inflation is rising and we're going to be in a recession if we don't get all of this what are you guys say about that\nYou know this is so often what happens Democrats get in and we fix the mess that's been created by the Republicans the problem is this time they really created a mess\nBut that tax bill nearly two trillion dollars of additional debt in days after they passed it up Paul Ryan said um we're gonna have to do something the debts increase where you have to go after entitlements which is what they mean when they say Social Security and Medicare so\nYou know uh we need to be there just to make sure that someone doesn't do it in the very wrong way\nBut we have to go back after those big tax cuts for the wealthy and we have to make sure that we're protecting the programs that people actually a plan on in in count on that you've paid into your entire life like Social Security and Medicare so I I think you'll see Democrats very active on this but boy you know it always seems like we clean up the mess\nThat the Republicans crate while they're in government yet their rhetoric doesn't match their actions\nYou know if the Democrats are going to clean up the mess rather than doing it like Clinton did by cutting welfare right I Would much rather see rolling back the rate at all the way back to the Reagan tax cuts that America was working really really well before Reagan but you know Reagan's tax cuts and uh you think there's any chance lesser\nWhat we offer a lot of those ideas in our annual progressive caucus budget the people's budget or we have a new classification for people who are even higher income levels as well as going back to some of the previous rates so you know we're hopefully going to be as we will be advocating for that as things move forward I think you know for us time the big question is do we have the Senate\nAh 'cause we don't we're not going to have the White House and uh you know how what's the majority in the house a lot of that is going to determine how aggressive we can be a we're certainly going to talk about it but the reality is where the votes will be will depend on where the sun it's at and how big of a margin and having a house\nThere you go to Rick in Flint a Texas you're on the air as cars invoke\nGuys hey Rick uh we we need to change the messaging on the way Medicare is explained everybody right now Medicaid is what I'm On handicapping really really poor people and Medicare is for elderly people retired people\nWhat we're not getting out is the fact that medic what we will have will be for everybody from the very first born to people on their deathbed will cover everybody there will be no more out of pocket your gun right\nYou'll be covered and we're missing the point fingers are getting the crap scared out of them that oh God my Medicare will be gone no we won't you won't be enhanced it'll be much better ... Canada has gone we've got to work on the ... and I ...\nI think you know one thing when we say Medicare for all we say the for all part right so we are saying it's for every single person so to exactly to your point that's why we're trying to keep it simple\nAnd talking about it in that way but also I think you know Donald Trump just put this out there that somehow you're going to lose your Medicare but I don't think anyone's buying it no senior group is jumping on it or if he's being called out right and left\nFor his allies that somehow Medicare won't exist and you're right we want to actually expanded and make it better for seniors are including things like negotiating for prescription drug prices so um I I think the message largely is out there they're trying to put this misinformation out there I don't think they're succeeding again not when you have Seventy percent\nSupport Medicare for all and writers polls um but I Do think it's important that we talk about it as you said that it's for everyone it's not taking away anything from any senior in fact the seniors will have a better program they currently have but\nEveryone then we'll have that same good program\n... center in New York you're on the ...\nHi I'm I just wanted to say um when you were commenting that every time a Republican comes in the Democrats have to come in and ...\nI had been saying that for ever I cannot understand how people now see I never followed politics that much but I could see it over and over again now I'm wide awake and I'm In politics but\nIt it's just why are people not seeing that I mean even your Republican seniors should see that they go after our Social Security and Medicaid ... I just don't get it\nYeah kind of you know their hind with putting big lives out there and they put really big money from you know Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers and others behind delivering those messages that run completely counter to their actions I think the good news is people are pretty well right now this election cycle I feel like\nI'm the reason that we are as good as the places we are on the house representatives and I'm picking up a bunch of governorships\nAround the country is because of people realize that in twenty sixteen elections have consequences a lotta people didn't come out and vote people aren't happy with the direction of the country and the tone of the federal government under Donald Trump and certainly a under Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell\nSo this is our opportunity to have some lasting substantive change but um you know\nSo right on this thank you for saying that county and you know we're trying to get that message out to that\nYou know so often what they say doesn't match what they do and that tax bill is like a classic example when eighty three percent of the benefit goes to the top one percent and they increase the debt two trillion and then days later Paul Ryan says we have to go after Social Security and Medicare you shouldn't have to say anything else than just that\nW there in New Hampshire hey W you're on the earth congressman folk him\nYes thank you guys both very much time and ... ... ... all that you guys do I sincerely mean that in the bottom of my heart I think the world would be much better place if we could clone you to\nChange that okay now you're very welcome thank you guys again I'm I'm so I had a couple of things um how can we make election day a national holiday\nYeah so I mean that's something we could legislatively do and I think that's a actually a really great suggestion because\nRobin Bainbridge Island Washington listening KFC are you're on the air with congressman poke him\nUp yeah you're on the Arab\n... ... to both of you who the great work you're doing a regarding forming a larger audience or have a question really for both of you but especially for Mark I'm\nSure you do a good job of detecting a conservative reactionary trolling\nAre usually very obvious\nA portion of that doesn't always work as with the Russians involved in the last election cycle and\nI worked in the area of developing algorithms for various\nPurposes is the government actively tempting to develop algorithm Britain be tacked illegitimate include not just in our elections are just referred to change\nPolicy at all different levels political trolling basically yeah\nYeah ... I mean when it comes to elections there's a lot that the federal government's not doing right now that it shouldn't be doing a we've got plenty of warnings we know two years ago the direct influence that happened we know from bringing Facebook and other social media platforms to Congress\nHow it can be misused and why we need to do more to make sure there's not that undue influence from outside the characters are trying to influence our elections and yet you've seen nothing come out of the Trump Administration using nothing that comes out of the Republicans in Congress to address this\nSo I think there's much more that needs to happen um let's hope in the coming weeks that we don't have the same problems and twenty sixteen because we haven't been more cognizant and to many in many ways those platforms have been more cognizant of watching and in policing themselves\nBut uh there's a whole lot from voting machine security to online social media to uh other advertising\nAnd by the way nobody's brought this up yet but was judge ... related at all to the lead arms dealer a non ...\nYou know I I I I'd have to look that up I'm not sure and I think there's some relationship there

others she has an MBA from Harvard\nWas a consultant for several fortunate one hundred companies wallet painting company in lectures widely across the globe his latest book that came out November of two thousand Seventeen zero hour\nHarry what is going on with the stock market in my friend\nYou know George we've been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we\nSigns of that in the last few days for a week and a whole from just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction hair which hearty close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by sixteen trillion dollars are free money printed since two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion\nRepatriated from overseas this stuff's just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than early two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed or you know a Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years\nLike a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five\nYears to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this\nTime you buy back in when things hit the bottom\nYeah you know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bond and make money which she did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses it'd be preserved your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring in your short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nAnd off because they're going they're going to do is they have in our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world or which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it goes to four thousand instead of two thousand so\nNo that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down ... percent and they don't have any net worth left to buy things\nWhen they're on a trip when what did the indicators I mean the market the last two days since really taking it on the Jim ... what's the cause for that is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to\nThe good old Donald um last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten thirty or bonds shoot\nUp I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this what happened we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks up above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower so\nYou know that that was the first thing to happen but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do and China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh if China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates and um\nAnd and then more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was\nFifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp\nRallied for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat did something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack that these last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump\nIs really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been boosting the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stop and that causes inflation to go up which it has an causes\nGrows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve is going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do if the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking at no this was predictable he's not\nYou know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not happy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what happened like Hillary if we had a couple more days of downturns I meet tomorrow if we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong here\nYes yes we were just at that point where we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year market peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we have a correction a sharp\nGoing very fast according to Tom so a march twenty third that's a Saturday the show was from five to eight the meet and greet is right

and got money in the bank their stocks could still get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that companies going to go out of business right\nRight again well any time you get a major downturn in a recession or stock crap like that some\nCompanies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions as bad thing they're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the companies that survive you know we had the

recently cracked and a lot of companies were not as well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you're a part Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a you know a\nHundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was and ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings up companies if companies\nAre so good that they keep their earnings flat instead of declining the valuations on stock how many times earnings like people will pay thirty\nTimes earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax talk does collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline for that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator for looking at some of these dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know how it it's called the smart money\nYou know if you tell us it's not a secret\nAnd well I Know I Know but I haven't been bullied me Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but but what what happened that there is that the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there that want us to jump in and buy when when when they see all investors are over Bachmann stocks over about they're the ones that short burst\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks they eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action whether there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money reacts in the morning the first thirty minutes\nI mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything and so the market's gonna open down it open down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most the most\nMe or bats when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that's the dumb money the smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit in short it or do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures\nWhat the smart money is doing versus the dumb money and the smart money that has not bought this rally and back they'd been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since it bottom February this year after that crap now they bought in to the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year\nBut once that crash happened they have not bought in this rally and it's been one of the deepest declines and smart money buying and that has been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd in in in in but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's going to\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or the or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got this book is going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year\nAnniversary of the greatest stock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is a one of many of our cycles we covered in zero hour\nAnd in our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom in global his\nLawn you know here we have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy yeah and if I did a it didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we're we're in the same position and we were coming into a two thousand sixteen uh marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom

be\nThe next global boom and then we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war ... what's that going to do to to the economy\nWell you know ... wars are actually stimulate have been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting if people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity products to you know\nA transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that so you know that goes both ways the wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression\nWas followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and make people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we this trade war and we said this and that zero our book you know came out a year ago\nThis trade war with China and it is a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nAnd they need us or our trade has three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much 'cause they see this is a long time\nBattle and they think longer term so so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nTourists on let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with a sigh Peter\nRight hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during this crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think ... yeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and I think that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up the\nTen times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's\nOur money they're pledging are they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise] so so they're they're at risk of two but yes when when you get the problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that and we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour to Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack the head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're going to take your deposit and work in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency bank can do that so\nPeople have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money other than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe back but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about is exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen\nIt started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and and in some countries worse than others\nNext stop we go to Keith in Rochester New York peace they get away\nOr Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricanes struck and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or any not they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work enough tax payers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh and you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people last not happening up here uh in New York the former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people flee to state\nThey insist that taking their short sighted left wing politics with them they go to a place like Texas or formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up\nUh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place or anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are letting\nAnti five run that city I'd like to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I'm saying flat out we're facing truth civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what\nYou're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats and a starting with that Puerto Rican example\nEr and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies are we're having them going to say to slowly than non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them both Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nAnd like hey let let let me are real quickly you're right about the Democratic thing there's no way that that Puerto Rico's going to become a state now with the Republicans in charge\n'em and and and they want to become a state now they didn't before because they didn't get the hell helping Maria\nThey were you see if you go to Orlando I used to be in Tampa right near their Orlando is getting is are the ones getting these high call Antonio in Puerto Rico here there's a shortage of doctors Dennis professionals everything because those are the people most moving so it may not be happening Rochester but you go to Orlando or Texas\nYou're going to see a different story most the Puerto Ricans in the fifties and sixties moved up into the northeast but the\nThey're mainly moving into Florida first than in places like Texas oh it is it is a mixed bag but I agree with you a hundred percent there is this red blue war in it is serious and there is going to be\nA lot of tensions and civil unrest and if there's this much now imagine what it would be like if we had Fifteen Percent unemployment in the U. S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference these Puerto Ricans are not\nUm don't have that sort of tension and not polarity that's the one thing I can tell you 'cause I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the less than a crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans are voting democratic big deal with what what was his point\nWell ... what what are you saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people that are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they ...\nSee Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling ya in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically a reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrat Rick Scott and Bill Nelson the running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans because they're five percent of the boat and that's enough to swing an election and they\nDidn't use into one of our democratic isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is let's

Want to ask you about a particular set or the market at the new year it has to do with the ...\nAnd I happen to get in mid July just before the end you're going to add up the road but the average company which apple it'd be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nFrom about fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is would you um would this kind of made a lot for a little bit particularly until the ah election this November because there are several\nStates that are looking to uh that happened on the ballot they legalize usually when that happened there was a kind of like an upcoming but would you pull out of that than now at this age you're up or what you're talking about taking place\nWell you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency are bought\nAll of these industries above all these these are the hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit\nBut the the the strongest sectors get hit the most 'cause they bubble up the most and people don't understand that\nSame with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so you do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see it as a pop but yes I Do think censure and such a hot sector take your games see what happens the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah it's things crash that is a good sector to get back into this is a long term social political trend it's going to go in that direction although there may be some backlash in the downturn just because\nPeople get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good sector but yes I I don't want to be an actor\nWhen when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because I went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector you know toilet paper um utilities movies you know ... you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse\nAnd valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector\nThat made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games yeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then\nOf the reason why I wanted it as a voucher as opposed to a ... and ... because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being a minute you\nDon't write if they don't spend it or just the uh you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief\nAnd and to have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damp bangs\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron download very good to have you\nKnow well hello there George and mass area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you're making a dentist now bought me taking the money I'm typing in my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or you know what's up\nWith those okay I I

dramatic um and at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going to because it would help other people\nIn the the stem cell transplant so why didn't they let's harvest stem cells from yourself\nWell that's one way of doing it but the the anonymous stem cells donated Holden hallowed Jeanette ... mhm with more effective than they actually found someone on the world by it\nYou can computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\n... and what was what was wrong if you want to get into their oh sure well I had leukemia ... um yeah and I had it for many years\nWell actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital and I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said he can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy\nUm and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that five m's cause they gave me the parents right now is the person who gave them the transplant she lives in an anonymous donor about the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact mhm\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the use of ... he was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the ... center in Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen if you still in touch with them the governor happened\nYes I did actually mathematicians in D.C and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nWhen you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and ... you know he said the way it came about was um they were having a donor drive in one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required his cheeks swab\nNice to meet ya yeah just to try to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor banks and then I'm ...\nYears later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells\nAnd they're given these injection for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live in such a but yes we become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nAnd Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling show heavily into the sidekick Rome has that help or hurt your psyche after\n...\nWell I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients genuinely they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see if Congress\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much psychotic right\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they\nDon't know what it is they think they're losing their minds but in fact these types of experiences are quite common you know for example um if someone is believed that they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post contact with the deceased loved one so\nLet's say you're a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel just touch on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of a loved one will have some type of post deaf contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist agnostic have his experience as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you OK but uh when you said that ... what's the basis for what makes you say\nWell the thing is the word psychic covers a lot of territory\nYou know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pre cognitive beams and other things you've talked about such as visions and voices and so on\nThe bed vicious near death experiences so certain types of searches experiences such as he has the ... the are extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nOf for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be said that was just thinking about you right that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability\nIf they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the tell a path a sense but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had this experience myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick and I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the site to roam out there in the ability to tap into have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nUm yeah that's true someone who say buffet with my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nThat seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nThat's right that's right yeah and in fact I had a great a great aunt who had an experience where she fell asleep\nAnd she woke up and she said her brother had died he was living in another country and tried to afterwards she found out yet to Betty a darn wow well yeah but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do\nBut you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women and I think that's probably true plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these psychic experiences are from the brain or outside of a\n... I Would say both I Would say that they are sort of um cooperation\nBetween what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these I'm experiences that protest in the brain so for example if you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and I was quite young\nI had one at eleven I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little affects I've ever had I mean are there I was bouncing on the ceiling may looking at my body and bad I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother said uh George you don't go very bad\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream than what the at that point it's lamb ... back into my body\nI woke up I was jarred ... eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me\nNow but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later she stumbled into the psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do since at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just find myself voting on the ceiling letting down at my body and that\nBy you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience has there is a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... Penn field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on electrical stimulation on the right time for car taxes they both producing out of body experience\nBut that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the ban that tells me that the that ... had been\nWill protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body experiences we have quite straightforward um they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral\nIt works at San instantly inch less and the idea that we're very quickly I teach at a very small in now and then you pay for you might feel a little bit puffy has just lifting lifting the product can have like a dangerous man and one isn't it something called ... which is kind of a darling internally holiday right now at the ...\nAnd actually relaxing also come a time to relax I felt like you can literally in the ... and\nI think reading is still the case for like a clay minerals and they're making is actually increasing surface tension and that's going to push hanging if had right\nInstantly age let's today go to our exclusive website HP gone dot com H.

Eighteen percent of them had a new report in the near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would've all habits because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain not just as a small percentage so you know that's one thing but\nThen the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S and there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they've been been reported throughout time\nAs superstition is always a fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was above horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently\nReally understood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse spent on something else some loss in ... in the movie screaming you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your permission\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think\nPeople are they don't believe they don't believe and also they are afraid of giving into something which appears irrational tell me a\nLittle bit about blind people in a overseas and things like that\nWell that that's a very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they would have to be able to tell the doctors nurses\nUm what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies with one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his doctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery\nI think no he was a he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac harassed and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered the newsprint and find where she put his dentures\nMaybe wanted his teeth back right\nYou have you back but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nWere they were wild yeah it works it doesn't work yeah more than what have you learned it many above\nAll of what do you think it is\nI think wow I think that it it till component like after\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it made it yeah I think I think it's paranormal enacting virtual I mean the word that are you hearing any nominate some people call them like all the paranormal other virtual when I'm a law\nOr the cold I mean it really is relative or than being used to defend your family then\nBut I think paranormal again\nAnd have a virtual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every parent normally do have partnered depends on the prairie having man how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely I\nThink it improves the quality of life for people to feel like maybe something more out there that we don't have to live in nine to five you know they live that if anything more that we don't really know about and I think it should be but\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make is we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things you were just talking about here on the coast to coast day you\nFind out more about the nights get log on to go to go to a um dot com\nNews radio ...

the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain\nOr a lot of my brain I have been a mistake in had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I've left my body but I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult\nAnd I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front ... that's where I used to go as out of body experience when I was little\nAnd there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in\nSpirit not physical and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be there but you did that it is a remote viewing huh no I was I was out of the body travel\nAnd when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child had still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people ... and we were fighting on the along with with canal with or without the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven sixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad why\nI don't know whether I'm there to help balance\n\nWhat are you where do you think of as many well I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I've been sleeping\nAll the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up\nOkay between sleep and wake but the most interesting experience I think I've ever had\nIs what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed because I'm In physical form and there is no we're on earth for loved ones that you feel when you were in that\nParticular place of knowing what all income fussing love is and when I was during meditation or at least they can and I could see if you knew what glitter looks like in a in a like a\nHelmet for a motorcycle helmet guess how the different angles well this was alive\nLight and the whole screen of my vision was filled with this glittering youthful different colors of orange and yellow\nAnd I could hear the voice saying this is love and I was totally in Gulf\nAnd it was just a beautiful experience but I saw I'm listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't what include just I'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I the last\nTime it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought you were saying I'm back here yeah All right but you know that type of stuff and\nThat's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of vision is because I've been a or I don't know that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life\nOr whether they're able to function or whether there's an illness that's interfering with their life\nSo you can make a diagnosis adjust on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia because someone with a diagnosis gets free didn't have to have a thought disorder as well they\nHave to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions and you know if their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the type of experience as you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations compared to actual psychic thing what's the person\nWell\nThere again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia and they can also be the hallucinations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess the each person has to be a fast you know in terms of\nYou know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting the person's ability to function\nBut I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of pain and other dark places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a virtual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think there must be a reason why she is going to those places\nTo go to Joe in Monterey, California hatred of going\nBack to George a doctor matters a Europe breath of fresh air and let me tell you ...\nI have a a two questions and I have a really interesting experience um do you ever do psychic fans and find that your sessions are better because of the environment as opposed to let's say a one on one\nAnd you know the work of Dr Stan is La Crosse he does or spiritually merchants or altered states he's a psychiatrist by the way\nYes definitely I'm familiar with Dr ... in terms of psychic goes I don't go to such a good but I have attended on international confidence is on science and spirituality and I do find that when I'm with like minded individuals\nWith these types of experiences are more common\nYeah 'cause I I could see that happening\nWell for one thing you feel more accepted and you feel more able to talk about what's going on you know you feel more comfortable right and you know you don't feel like you're going to get ridiculed down and I think it's important to therefore you're not so defensive that's true\nAnd again I'm fascinated with the possibilities of be able to you know like pre she'll perform an extra ... there's something demonic about have you come across anything like that in your studies\nDemonic possession anything like that no I haven't but you know there was a psychiatrist Scott ...\nI don't know if you're

one comment about your previous caller sure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition ... ...\nIf you look at the Bible there's certainly lots of biblical profits like Daniel and is the key all or for example Joseph you know who had the cognitive dreams are prophetic dreams you might say and even the in the history of the church people

oh a somebody that there's something really awful and hair and he said well I mean he ... and uh\nAt that point I had a lot of foreign students I talked my college were recruited all over the middle east and\nUh and and the Pacific region like Indonesia as Japan and I had a lot of foreign students in my physics prices and so I said well you know maybe it's a person from another culture or didn't understand and you know if he thought that would like to go to the bathroom and you know okay so I wake up\nAnd I thought that's a weird dream I'm going to write that down in some detail I woke my cell phone okay so that's like on a Monday\nI'm almost out of time here so I got to push a couple of days later I get a call from an old\nFriend of mine are caused by the river roommates were good friends for four years and it's a very I'm going to be in San Francisco I'm In Monterey I'll be in\nAnd free enterprise Seventy five hundred toys and went to a ... item distributing\nChild had been married for ... an army angel tree for more information on that three point nine\nEighty to ... do you tell them is three Thirteen\nMorning workout you are listening to America's first news this morning with Gordon do\nTend to forget that into an ordeal\nAlone with ... thanks for joining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura could just do the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent of rapes are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty or fix to it's just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger I even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be a deeper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though the fiber than has actually historically pretty normal or it's going to feel like I think a a ... for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's eight pains threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nI'm with that said though I think that we are observing the market is a lot more interest rate a sense that it has been in the past\nUm and I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw a huge run up in prices when rates were low\nAnd ah and so I think a buyer they're already more strength and they all that happened in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura or the high rates of negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe\nAround report and I but anyway a full percentage point at least below a where rates are now I'm so there are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a moral has a strong incentive to refinance\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce their asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally um overall on an annual ah if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing\nUp price growth is slowing and I am definitely share a especially in some of the more expensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York or the\nWe're hearing more and more about price productions\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think it means that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought the biggest jump within and rates in two years um and prices aren't going to\nGo on and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high um but I Do think for a buyer that just got exhausted I'm far from a bidding war as in cash buyers that real friends say that we've had in the market\nThat has really cold and so I think for ... a little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes up for them and uh and maybe adjust our prices down or the bad I think it\nCan be a good time to buy thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal [noise]\nFortunate the

the money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to nail hub of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend Janelle how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we have actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really grown it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know I ... and that that's a really good question and\nWhere I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical\nSituation there where you have [noise] you know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant in rural district and\nUm there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district ... or early spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [noise]\nAnd um so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend this my we're recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYeah and that's it and other unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into the same money are saying well wow you know what it really does a help for the kids get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice in fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with ... to the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know at some of these districts they had already met the minimum\nUh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started out when they are when they were all five days if they were already seat in the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat it each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey when kids have to be in school at certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and\nI noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they\nTypically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals are to those nonprofit certain\nCases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve meals because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during the school day period\nSo a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the district seat that use for day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's\nYou know it's all you know let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to you know get away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um parents start out not liking it but they end up liking it\nTurned out I guess the biggest question that twenty thousand dollar question what kind of been impacted this have on learning do we know yet\nYou know and I've looked at study after study in ...\nFrom what I can see academics just based on these studies academics are not suffering under the four day and there was actually in school districts to say that they've noticed higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school or that's how that's how they feel\nUm but academics we haven't really seen studies that show that\nKids too horrible it just seems to be like you know academic surely just don't

agenda they started selling off I mean it would be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think ah when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigation than impeachment and higher taxes and and you know it then\nThey want to get rid of ice they won't fund a border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands were the election today though it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races\nBut not quite as far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York and I've noticed which is a pretty hard core left wing state even as a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state\nDid you know that I didn't know but if I got\nI got ... no he actually said those conservative\nOr their problems not me and the Democrats they blew themselves are they are they the extreme show voters\nOr write to me it was so whether it is that there are because of that show that they are and they're still at the extreme conservative\nSo they have no place in the state of New York so we noticed that it's not New Yorkers are it's\nSimple no one has tons within a rifle no one me\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment\nUh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm saw but there's no place for me and the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina and South Carolina all calling and invited me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor and everything you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York\nOr to promote Hannity went off is like to run for I think my friend John and I can\nI Johnny Williams we disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office so I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still am when you're working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to a joint 'cause we New York that's our biggest export is it the people on taxpayers of New York state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no\nNo income tax and no state income tax they have jobs\nBut by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a uh the former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg ... hundred it oh yeah yeah I I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him 'cause he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg or get to a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical and that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most is showing said the most important midterms\nIn our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being a put back in this place that that the average person might have something to say about how their wives are going to be garden governed have control of their own healthcare\nFor but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just fighting a frightening Republican Doug shown does not want this do you do\nOh I Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get boats in these marginal rates and I'd like to should go very hostile\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times we've been on the radio as you know you knew what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again once the message of the house Republicans to get reelected this type what should it be on the which should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nWell I think it's got to really want to or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years\nIf you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh over all of those messages I unconstitutional original is on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nYeah but you can put all those issues in one vessel and personalize it because Nancy Pelosi will take away all those things she'll reverse it will have fewer jobs to raise taxes ... you'll have more open borders you won't have security\nYou'll have enlisted investigations and we know Maxine wants to impeach forty five page forty five ... forty five I Will take a break\nVery glad to see a lot of the coverage that I ... and a lot of the help that has been on the way a lot of the capital result right did I even see the putting up you know all the\nAlthough electric power the Saudis you all the different power companies from throughout the south east Texas an old neighboring states they all hands on deck and they're all help everybody out then I'll just hang in there and I know this or any need for some people look\nAt the American people will be there for you were just that's the word family and a lot of people lost\nA lot ... hurricane and our thoughts and prayers go out to you all\nUm have lifted it's friday and a twenty five days now it's all like should they might've put a little bit of your party light on and it's our friday Florida Georgia Line background concerts theories against it [noise]\n...
