about this I Am so tired of the a misuse of the word entitlement and\nI Am so sick of hearing about this whole Social Security thing when Ronald Reagan said he fixed a Social Security what they did was raised the age and change the tax everybody knew this was coming because of the boomers\nBut the thing that they did that was the sneaky stuff all its Social Security had always been lifted not on the budget\nIt had been lifted someplace else because what comes in is what goes out right no tax money income tax let's say let's clarify no not one dime of income tax money covers Social Security\nThat is paid for by you and your employer and it is only do cheese you\nIt is due to you when you retire correct what they and someone they changed where they looked at it now they can call it part of the budget it isn't part of the budget it never was intended to be part of the budget and nobody ever says Social Security which is a program that pays for itself\nAnd Medicare pays for itself Medicaid is an extra for it but they are a small raising those taxes or Medicare for all would completely eliminate the problem\nThat we had just lifted the capital if we just we have to go\nAnd we have awful nasty people in Washington DC who just can't stand anybody to have anything if they're not a millionaire\nIt it seems that that's the case I I think that there's actually a a deeper philosophical argument that the conservatives are making to themselves I don't just think those I mean you can read it and Russell kirks book the conservative mind and in numerous other publications over the years they used to be much more upfront about those William F buckle used to talk about this right out loud\nWhich is that if you have a stable and secure middle class the conservatives feel\nOr or worry that that will lead to social instability it'll do it'll lead to things this is what what Russell Kirk predicted in Nineteen fifty one\nWas as the middle class was starting to emerge as a result of FDR's policies\nThat if the middle class got strong enough you would see women demanding equal place in the workplace you wouldn't see young people refusing to uh to honor their elders\nAnd uh I I forget the list but there was you know there's a ... a couple of things there that you know that he laid out basically and sure enough it happened I mean you know in the sixties they legalize birth control pills and sixty one and boom you have the women's movement\nAnd uh they legalized abortion and Seventy three and and and throughout that uh you know two decade Arab more or less who had young people refusing to go to Vietnam and all all the Republican sat around and go after Ross Russell Kirk was a profit we've got to destroy this middle class and turn these people back into the working poor so they will just shut up and go to work\nAnd you know stop voting so I pass away not stop protesting and stop demanding things and and we can get on the about the business of getting rich\nAnd that's what's going on in my opinion girl\nAnd Enron and and uh the current occupant of the White House is doing that in a different way with all of this craziness I I scream every night at MSNBC for\nTalking as if this is a normal man you know she is not king he will never be he is not going to change his Seventy two years old hits carved in stone what he is made

block he's a ... and his ... and ... is a Canadian immigrants to the United states and he you know he gets he gets all kinds of stuff and he will he will speak the truth\nI'm a you know on occasion and I you know I have a lot of respect for him as a journalist uh although I Would still like to see the so called liberal network actually be liberal and actually have liberals on him\nJust anti Trump Republicans but yeah I'm with the journal any move along but thank you for the call and thanks for listening to us there in St Paul Jesse in Miami a desk and hey Jessie what's up\nPlay hard job so much hay or I Want to do the basics used to be used for miss the boat journey said\nThat you know that God should don't mean not\nYeah ... what was your no matter you know actually has an exact quote was Ronald Reagan taught us the deficits don't matter and what he was saying was Reagan was the first guy to do the to Santa Claus theory triple the national debt while he was an office and then as soon as he left the Republican started screaming that the Democrats needed ...\n...\nThanks for what's behind ... don't mean to these guys know the whole system\nIs a scam so we didn't know much about a [noise] big Ben ... more than ... good high\nThen they start planning Scrooge and all of that so we go on to a song and dance to not do\nWell it's not for nothing I mean Social Security literally has never failed has never missed a check it's never been out since Nineteen thirty six it's never missed a payment and that's a big deal that that's not a scam that actually works and\nNot get to see him go as important\nThings that don't me not to because they printing money they can change that we create realities\nYeah although that was in a different context he was talking about you know we can convince those weapons of mass destruction\nThis bill is saying because everything we see and hear lose what their control yeah they don't even have\nReport you write about the crash a six string happy but was political\nYeah well actually there was an economic downturn in twenty sixteen that that it wasn't only report it after the fact um because it was obscured by the rising stock market at and where I Am more proof at the stock market is not the economy Jesse thank you uh you know I mean good points all Susan Brunswick, Georgia aces and what's up\nHey time I read an article in a in a magazine and I also looked it up on the government website and it seems to be true and I wanted to make everybody aware of this it's called save the American workers act and you can look that up\nAnd what this is it's it's a on it's going to get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and got that and all of that\nBut the but in this bill that they're ready to pass what's also stuffed in there is any corporation and part people where they get their health care sued their jobs companies whatever\nThat if you're working under thirty and thirty nine hours per week which a lot of companies uh people are still getting their benefits with those hours\nBut now if you're going to war only thirty nine or thirty hours a week they are going to be allowed to get rid of your\nHealth insurance through your job\nWhich means that they're only going to get health care to people that are going to be working over forty hours a week\nFor most people don't work forty hours a week but they're still getting their benefits so they're going to get people working at only thirty nine hours and they're not going to get any healthcare whatsoever from their jobs\nAnd I think this is super duper important and people need to be aware of that we are going back to the Nineteen thirties\nAnd one other point real quick time if you would win you know your guest on can you really on go over the on cutting of the Social Security and Medicare\nI Am in my sixties and that's something that's really weighing on me and just what exactly does that mean what age group are they heading and what are the Democrats you know planning on getting that message out or just to be a little\nAt as long as they get a half a crumb more than black people they're satisfied if the rich white stay the whole loaf of bread I Can't understand that and you are historian and I think I read somewhere\nThat\nIn the beginning\nPoor white and black people into marriage live together\nYeah there was a fair amount about up in the earliest decided\nThat they would put a winning edge between those two groups tell the whites that build a lot late with rich fight whoever is the rich I think the same way about\nPaul whites all about black people there and they just can't seem to come together\nIn the technique that the rich white uses very successful and they continue to use it and they should because it's successful all you have to do is give one group\nI have a problem more than the other group or even with a group give some factions within that group a few more crimes than the rest of the group\nAnd you've you've wipe out whatever goal they directed against the\nWealthy white and I don't I mean it's successful\nSo you know and I and conquer John and and and you know this is what Lyndon Johnson pointed out when he said the Republican strategy is essentially if you can convince the poorest white person but he's better than the richest black person he'll let you pick his pocket\nAnd and you know that is where they you know that has been the Republican strategy LBJ called it out and sixty seven and it's been going on ever since\nAnd I was I was going on long before that and and you're on your point about the thin veneer of civilization I think it's a really important one it's like the thin layer of the American middle class and these things are there by virtue of a whole lot of people creating structures\nThat put them in place and hold them in place\nAnd the Republicans are systematically destroying those structures and it's like they're taking the murder beams out of the building\nAnd eventually it's just going to be in the shell and it's going to collapse in on itself\nAnd you know whether you call it civilization or democracy or or you know the America or whatever and then that's one of the things that concerns me so much John thank you and then you really an analysis thank you so much John Edwards in Wisconsin hey John what's on your mind\nLike Tom uh my idea is I've been going door to door for higher gas around here and Randy Bryce humpback\nDo it's a it's the whole thing of um fascism I used to call it corporate system because the we've had a lot of union people around here and we understand that the corporation they don't want to hear from the people the one thing I hate the worst is\nThey have the people tell them how to run their business right and it almost seems like now Trump is using or the Republicans are using the exact same sample like example of a union busters and they want they don't want the people that have a boy\nYeah I\nKnow they're right up front about it right up front about it and then you've got you know big corporations that are right up front about it too I mean even you know Amazon now is this is a you know having their their managers and they took over a whole foods they're they're having their managers sit down and watch the videos about how evil unions are and how these screw things up yeah it's\nBasically an audio right out front and you know it's alive because everybody else worked in the union around here and the other one point I wanted to bring up too as we used to have a ...\nAnd we used to make military shoes you know we had left that than down here as a representative and we used to get a lot of pork barrel it just seems like more than\nJust shipping all overseas yeah well that was you know

that away from us now to where we even have to\nPay copayments now for our ah prescriptions and stuff and that's just another way that the Republicans keep stealing and we paid some pretty hard news

defended this country and you know here's a good example you're giving of of what's happening but you know second it it really opens it up to a bigger broader issue the\nRepublicans in Congress are

been saying when I've been saying for months we will eat compliments if you guys get Congress back\nWe need to put some I'm cloud laws and that would say quite plainly that uh you have to be as clear and transparent as the LA skyline after a Santa Anna's cleared very air and that's that uh\nI don't want Trump to be able to obfuscate and I mean I Know who he was in Nineteen sixty eight when he made it really difficult for uh LA unified to build a badly needed to school on the Ambassador Hotel site so I'm\nI've known each and no good news for forever but I Would like to see some measure saying okay you want to run for president or governor or senator or congressman or you know any other you want to be out in the um a job\nOr you had better be able to produce your tax return your college transcripts\nOr there should be a civil service exam for um\nAnybody who runs for a that title high office I Want to make sure we never get a jerk like Trump anywhere near the White House again not even as a visitor and I'd like to know what are\nThey Democrats assuming you in a nice steak house back in ... not the Senate what you guys can do to make sure that something like this happens and protect their vote yeah\nGreat question Sarah and you know um I I think one of the things I've I've mentioned John Sarbanes from Maryland is leading a taskforce on one of the vice shares\nA lot of a lot of other folks actually are trying to address that it's such a good government taskforce dressing everything from elections reform\nTo campaign finance reform to ethics reform and we want that to be um HR one that means the very first bill that Democrats introduced in the house representatives would be a bill to address all of that\nOr we want to start the hearings on the tax returns and on the monuments clause to get to the bottom of a all the the corruption really that's happening with this current administration so there's a lot that we can do and we are very committed to it because I'm you know I think for many of us\nWe thought there monuments clause was pretty self explanatory took this president to make it\nA somehow confused and now we've got to get there and clear that up on the taxes to every presidents always released them this is the first one not to I guess we have to clear it up but Democrats are committed to do that and again many of us are advocating this to be the very first bill introduced in Congress next session\nCharlotte in Ramona, California here on the air with Congress and poke in\nHigh a permanent congressman I'm calling to ask you a question about um what is the I Am mostly on the progressive side but I'd confused what is the position that the progressive take on the issue of immigration\nSuch as what to do with the children that are coming up on a company's each from the south what to do about the middle east refugees what is your policy if if the progressive could get what they want I'd like to know what that would be\nSure I'm so Charlotte I think what we've been advocating for um is really what work was kind of done two sessions ago and well it wasn't perfect it was a about a hundred percent earth where we're at right now uh which was comprehensive immigration reform that me\nThere's going to be some extra protections at the borders but there's also going to be a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans or we have to recognize we already have um probably about Thirteen million people here\nWho are here undocumented uh it's not realistic to think it's someone who came here when they were two weeks old or two years old is going to be deported at age twenty or forty um to a country they may not speak the language in and they may not know anyone there\nSo we have to have something in place and it's not an automatic ah there's a process to do that a bill went through the Senate with a I think about Seventy votes\nUm two sessions ago and didn't get taken up by the Republican leadership in the house representatives uh it was a bipartisan compromise didn't go as far as I would've liked to go on in some areas but realistically I that is approach we have to do right now family separation um DACA\nI mean all these are separate fights we're having that we shouldn't we should have a comprehensive immigration reform and I think that's the path that we would try to bring forward again should we be in the majority\nBill in ... Arizona you're on the air with Congress in ...\nI'm been congressman good morning ended up to five more real quick question for the first is this right you have these corporate still owns dispensing as well as with George W. Bush and how do you like working with Kristin cinema I'll listen\nThe line thank you\nYeah so I mean ... there's a lot of attacks period right now with this president more so than even in the past but I think you know basically um we we have protections are in this country\nOur problem is when the White House a is doing some of the things that are doing that you know Mali minutes clause actions are not showing tax returns things that we always took his norms\nAre we have to fix some of that so um\nIf we take the majority in the house that's one thing but do we have the majority in the sun it's another thing we still have Donald Trump is president\nI there's gonna be a process to getting us back to where I think many of us would be a comfortable bill a second question I just send them I think as a great chance away in the Senate seat she came in\nIn my class or she is a very a smart person I've known her since before she was in Congress she was a very\nStrong progressive a legislator in Arizona I Know she's moderated a little more when she got to Congress but uh she is a very very um I'd almost use the word whip smart which I don't usually use person yeah she's got a great wit and I think when she gets to the Senate she will be a strong voice\nAnd it'll certainly flipping that seat in Arizona is a really important to everyone in the country\nGreg in Richmond, Kentucky you're on the air with congressman poke him\nGreg yes yes they are calm think your congressman I'm calling today um I make every attempt to speak\nTo my friends who are Republican and have open honest and meaningful conversations with them about issues that affect them\nAnd what I'm learning is they themselves really not are not that well informed about the issues and what's going on in Congress a focus on the three big uses I call them health care Social Security Medicare\nAnd I'm surprised at how little they know but of course the majority of them are listening to Fox News and I'm not saying the corporate corporate media outlets are much better but what I'm calling today is to suggest that the D triple C consider making some changes that may be a new course strategy\nNumber one maybe they could start year round education efforts maybe have TB TV commercials year round even in non federal election years\nVoter registration drives year round focusing on new voters and uh using technology to keep their their the existing Democrats and independents would follow them in the loop on what's going on today or what's coming up next month\nAnd potentially having a ... D triple C national website so if they did have commercials talking about these issues which affect the the voters they would have a source that they could go to and get more information thank you\nYeah Greg I'm so two things first of all I think you make up a a really strong point I think what I Would argue is really that probably is the work of the DNC since they have that connection to the\nDemocratic Party's throughout the country on the D triple C is kind of the arm of the congressional ... a campaign the Democratic congressional\nMembers at the Democratic congressional campaign committee and they are have resources to really spiked bar at election time but the DNC hopefully is that ongoing presence and I think under Tom president Keith Ellison or they've tried to do more of that but I I completely agree with you you can't just to have a conversation before the election you have to have it ongoing\nSecond if I can time because I think this brings up a point that you and I have talked about a lot too and it relates to a question that Jay from Maryland asked before the break um which is Social Security you know if you want to talk to these folks and you're right they're not getting the news from Fox they're not getting it from the president he tells everyone's got fake news you have to\nSeniors who just rely for their life and death on whether or not they have that money I think we can really have a conversation with those who don't have a different reason for wind to vote for Trump and and you know in some cases there's things like racism and others that are just tougher to break through\nRobin Phoenix, Arizona you're on the air with Congress and poke him\nYes oh pleasure to talk to a um wanted to talk about the D D triple C strategy here and I think what what's happening with our our party as we get kind of into the weeds on stuff it only affects the very few people\nAnd I think one thing that we should do is basically promote the idea that the Republicans are the ... by a thousand cuts on the middle class and we need to fight this by tax reform and we just use their philosophy since corporations are people there should only be one tax code income is income which should get rid of the uh you know Fifteen Percent cap\nOn a dividends and just treat all the from the same because corporations are people so therefore people are corporation we should get the same the doctors or you should take the direction of the way from the corporations and move that way or the one thing about the taxes on Social Security\nDoes that's kept on you know at a hundred and thirty two thousand Kay of income that's a hundred percent six point three you want to give most of America a five percent\nA rave right away to cap off and make again Texas Social Security on all income all the way up you don't care if it at one thirty two people will get a five percent or a tax cut right there\nYeah right ... to the first issue um I agree there are many of us who in many I mean a quite a bit in the Democratic party who've advocate for changing that code on the passive income so called passive income\nVersus active income uh there shouldn't be that distinction and I think that's something that we're going to be talking about\n'em to the second point I agree I mean it's really a regressive tax when you have a cap on Social Security a certain point and we're talking about how long does the\nFun to have the only difference I might say Rob is I don't think it's really going to be a cut for people I think if you lifted the cap or adjusted the cap for inflation significantly um you'll just extend the life of Social Security so that we don't have to have an increase I don't think you see an immediate cut but\nThat's actually the reason to do it we have to have Social Security around a because everyone is paid into it they have to be able to get it when they retire and the best way to do that is to really look at that cap\nAnd it just seems kind of bizarre the you know a a high and most of the people I Know are paying\nA you know a a Social Security taxes on all of our income and you know billionaires are paying Social Security taxes on you know one percent of their income I mean it's like they're really they're not paying their their their fair share of for to support Social Security which is a program that keeps his country vital\nYep and and there's a lot of um ideas of how we could exactly do this but I look at the cap is is one of the single easiest ways and that would also argue we should change the index for how we increase what people getting Social Security\nTo a CPI dash eat witches are based on what senior spend their money on for twenty five percent of their income is on medicine and medical care\nUm we should recognize that and that way they would get a little bit more of a boost as well\nCongressman we have forty five seconds to the end of the hour what are your thoughts on the coming week\nYou know I'll tell you were a now less than three weeks to the election I think my thoughts for the next three weeks are going to be on the election as our I think most people um I just really ask people to be active with the candidates you support and the groups\nThat are supporting the candidate to support in the next three weeks it's so vital um every vote we get out of the majority of people agree with us on the issues\nIf they get out to vote we will be very very successful and be able to turn this country and many of our states around so I'm pleased take that that apes that you have right now over what's going on turn it into activism we can build us into a movement and not just have a moment um I I think that's the key for the next few weeks\nAnd share our values as we talk about our issues\nYou know I tell you one of the big things we're doing now is we actually even when we do doors is supposed to talk to people they really do agree with us\nUnder some Hogan thanks so much for

student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy rage uh there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices fruit in lending laws if things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans or and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George\nSo the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections but I just mention\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in his or her chosen major\nUh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available they get that discounted off their student loans or is that you know that novel huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact cabins Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you are making a minimal a annual salary ethics forty thousand dollars or so [noise]\nUm that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there but I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen\nA you know the founding

sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court and there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't\nIf they don't get the ... then they become subject to arrest show in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal districts there people are literally being hauled\nOut of their homes by swat teams and and and forced\nTo uh to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nYou mean if they're not properly served by a process server or the sheriff or a private process serving called company if they're not served ... you're saying that can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWell that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are and just this one federal district or they had plans on a rush gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people\nThe one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan and they hauled this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nThat's included in penalties interest in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera I'm\nBetcha debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson flirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison\nA that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war has arisen army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction and this\nGuy that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans they old fifty thousand or they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do what you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that\nMoney on it [noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy op and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you take it out you bite on line and say you know look\nHas great reviews you go and that you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch and you go back to the dealership you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should or read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans that particularly as you as you rightly say for lower income\nPeople um you know of what\nWe're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night are expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to\nUm you know disadvantaged uh under privileged people ... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible\nSort of a nonsensical education's the joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this ... their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the deck and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody goes to college winds up with student loans but still this was a you know I'm a an economically needy group of people who\nYou know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and how cruelly ironic is it that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help uh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent as\nCrazy crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nOr a it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for ... probably Seventy or Seventy dollars and Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even worse goals by the way um\nBut uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they didn't get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories for\nPeople go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand dollars ... crazy\nSo this has just gotten so unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a\nAnd I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just you provide\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nHi George Tylenol you guys doing good thank you\nI or join and they got good news where he's the man a drop rally over there in a lab but in Iowa the other day yeah and then there was a big fines drop\nAt least according to seal back there he looked right at me hold that thought of\nBut I I Love it load up anyway I I had a I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school or\nA ... a former company I used to work where I got trained on egg while they are they're them when a company went under the under the not the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now I Know that it was a sad time but I'm not really pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd that was one of those people do so I Love the perfect job I hold near there not one but they wouldn't even let me take the wild is with us work because I didn't have that little for them to get visas paper saying that I'm there without a ... big loss for a couple of years you know and\nAnd you probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThey'll and uh I looked at the local school there and they want to ... thousand dollars just to go it for oh I think it was a month or just on paper while you know I was like there is no way\nSo I ended up going out and less than ... dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi Dr ... and then I felt like I got shafted on that as I found out that I thought it was not up for about half the price now they've been talking\nA let's get your reaction to the Delaware you think a trade schools well he\nYou know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge you know almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys\nWant to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out\nOf getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly gallon he's the one who pointed out to me there's a lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook\nOn it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dad okay I already knew the doping and I bought this\nBut now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is that ... I'm a foreigner I served as everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a forty three split decision in the shadow case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a spot right to serve it as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals\nWant a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attack because there's money going to an arm of the state government college\nAnd were being over ... that the liberal as a matter of fact the price of college is about ten times when you adjust for inflation what it was back in the heat\nAnd here's the thing okay we spent a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spent all in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security but we can only got those things a little bit\nThe on the third or fourth thing is probably\nThe tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only that the the tax dollar on the hook and it's gonna crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian and I'm Alan by the way I'm I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and I hope I'm\nA ... he's gotten on any for talking a little too much in and out\nOf it and I all seriousness here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total that his college debt and and it's going to crash the dollar that's the only thing if we get rid of these were the lead and get a credit\nCard not okay with that alone let them get a credit card it'll things the tax dollar and it'll save the stint in college will drop like a rock and the I I Love I Love\nMy rich man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs and hospitals and police book and here it can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look if he can get bankrupt me repeatedly for millions in bailout and hand out and have all these rich banker\nIn these college is going to get rich on the students looking here that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nAnd and okay and they use these are All right we got your point there Gordy Alan\n... you know I'd buy he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq I think we can throw a maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view\nYou know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be\nA good thing it would return prices back down to a rational level\nA and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system the ... but in but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWalk away with all the debt right now Alan would you are just the white pit clean\nWell I Will say that if at a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThan we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a non partisan guy but I Will say that uh\nMiller was not well did that to Americans were injured in the crossfire the Taliban have claimed responsibility it's

one thirty seven\nUm but I think it's also coming to a crisis because Trump shown clearly articulated age a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy but he drives the love crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and indeed and I think they're just further isolates come\nTheir agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna peach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cut history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better\nAnd they've ever done um they also want open borders

to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that\nAnd we hate Trump that\nWell I think that's right in this part of it because I think if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think that I mentioned this on your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind\nAre Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him or the viciousness the smears the character assassination childish behavior by US Senators incentive meetings and all that came together to really re galvanized conservative\nAnd I think this caravan\nComing
