{"month": "10", "state": "SD", "station": "KOTA", "content": "A I'm share with you what I got as a tax cut\nBut both of Bloomberg service the Financial Times half a dozen agencies have now study what corporations did across the board\nWith the tax cut money and their conclusions were very few somewhere between three and five percent of American workers got any\nPortion of that tax cut it was overwhelmingly used\nFor stock buybacks such when companies by back their shares in the market to raise dividends to shareholders and to raise him a pay packages for top executives which corporations are free to do and which is what they in fact did all the talk\nAbout how we would end up helping workers' wages that's just the same old trickled down nonsense that if we give a tax cut the corporations and rich somehow it's going to find its way into average people's\nPockets that is very rarely true and the statistics are now in that it has not been the case or with a tax cut of December twenty Seventy\nYeah and then and he was asserting that his taxes were a thousand dollars lower does he had a thousand dollars a year more in his in his pocket\nBut I've I've also seen numbers that uh is and it's I just I just saw this couple days ago that suggested that while the average income the average wage in the United states is around forty four thousand right now the median wage in the United states and the roots half above half below\nIs only thirty three thousand two hundred dollars and the reason for that difference is that the average includes all these people who are making ... literally millions and millions of dollars at the very very top of the wage scale\nA and but that's not that many people it's just a hell of a lot of money and so the median is actually you know a reflection of what\nMost people in America are earning which is in a low thirties and or is that accurate\nAbsolutely I and and let me quote to you a wonderful piece of a statistical work done by the economic policy Institute in Washington DC they divided wages into high medium and low and they asked the question\nHow have these three parts of the wage distribution done between Nineteen eighty and now and what they show which is starkly is that\nThe lowly of wage people are actually worse off if you adjust for prices as all of these numbers do they are worse off now they can afford to lash out of their weekly wage and then they could Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty roughly\nThe middle group is just slightly above maybe three or four percentages above now what they were back in Nineteen eighty thirty eight years ago only the high wage people saw an appreciable increase in the neighborhood of thirty to forty percent\nWhich means at over the last Thirty years the missile and the bottom which is more than fifty percent went absolutely nowhere or shrank in terms of what they were getting for the labor effort they put out only those at the top\nAnd particularly because of the very top as you just noted were able to do better\nAnd that's a large explanation for the political divide we have for the rage in the population that watches a show called wealth effect or the recovery that seems forever to pass them by\nTheir right it has passed than by but the whole last Thirty years have passed them by they've gotten the wage increases the vast majority meanwhile their productivity what they do for their employer has gone up and they're in lies the explanation for growing inequality\nThe people who do the work are stagnant and the people who get the fruits of the work\nAre are gathering in accumulating wealth producing the kinds of divisions that are roiling our culture and our politics\nYeah and and we talk about average wages instead of median wages because we're just economically either as all of that guy disguises it there you go that's that's that's very well so so we'll see how this all shakes out it's ah it's it's just a remarkable

I think it's twenty six states maybe it's more than ...\nWhere Republicans are in charge of the voting process and according to Greg palace they've purged fourteen million people in the last twelve months in each one of those states need to find one person\nOne person who can who get who is sufficiently articulate intelligent and telegenic you know when we go on TV\nAnd and be very clear and passionate way say this is what happened to me you know I and and yes tried to get veterans as much as possible but I I don't think veterans are quite as iconic as they once were\nBut but uh yeah so this was you know I have been voting in the same place for and you know some states that will be an elderly person and some of that will be younger person or whatever it may be and do that state by state and then build a website That's got all fifty of those are all thirty those state you know a little uh uh the the one one minute an ad in YouTube clips on it\nAnd to promote the hell out of that because you're absolutely right Diane the number one strategy I mean historically Republicans have had strategy is like oh we're gonna\nWe're gonna have anti gay measures on the ballot right I mean that was the big thing back in two thousand or in Ninety eight or or you know a were you know ... back in the Nineteen eighties you know we wanna we wanna bring prayer back into our schools I mean they'll find some things that they put on the ballot to try to mobilize their base\nThey can no longer find anything that mobilize as their base outside of maybe eight of brown people which is you know which immigration is a ... too so instead what they're doing is they're just simply trying to remove\nA young people old people and people of color young white people older ... you know why people Ruth retired people actually of all races um\nAnd and people of color from the voting rolls that you know voter purges now or their main electoral strategy which is just obscene and yes it should be highlighted Diane thank you that was absolutely brilliant I Love it Patricia in College Station Texas have Patricia what's up [noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm well two things I'm Wondering can make a comment about Kevin ... I had been living in this county since the mid eighties I had moved here from overseas and um\nMaybe five years old and I just yeah and I've been registering people to vote for ten years or more and I just called on a whim last week to see if I were still on the voting rose in that county and in my state and I have been purged\nYou're kidding at\nA habit and found out why yet and I'm not sure exactly what to do the ... a voter registration ended Tuesday a week ago\nWell ... yeah I don't know what to do either it's a tie it I Would start by calling the American civil liberties union and the ACLU\nRate OK yeah they're all over those they're doing lawsuits all over the country they're doing a collaborative with great powers I'm a I Would call the ACLU and say what to do there are there are a other are voting projects they can probably direct you to want if there's one that's a little you know more direct to Texas are a little closer to you\nBut uh that's remarkable is your eye you don't need to see her last name on the air but is it a common name in a in the Hispanic or African American or Asian communities\nAnd yeah no you know Karen Michel or in the revolutionary war who jumped ship Ron okay hey Trent\nSo that's that's a trial and you know how you know Oregon do live in a liberal area is that the deal you live in a college town or something\nYeah to a tech in university ah okay so they probably\nDon't want the campus and I do have appealed box are at the campus post office\nSo I don't know so you're probably part of a purge of of campus voters basically\nWell and I have been very active in Democrat socialist in a Democratic Party\nToo and I think we almost turned in the primary for Bernie I think we almost turn our county blue and I've been so proud and up and you know something my chest and going around and saying Texas is not as bad as you think that um [noise]\nThere are power he sent me that just don't want everybody to about ... but they cannot comment I'd like to make 'em\nDuring his hearings he repeatedly said that he would when asked about a lie detector test that he would do anything close to the committee wanted him to do right\nAnd um [noise] but I think that that's all we needed we didn't need another shake investigation we just needed him to take a lie detector test\nWhile he also said that he was fine with him if he would be glad to talk to the FBI if the committee wanted him to ultimately the White House instructed the FBI not to question him so he was never put under under oath essentially or you know it was never facing federal Palin a felony charges for lying to an FBI agent\nIt's it's pretty amazing life Patricia I Need to move along with thank you for the call and they called back and let us know when you find out what the deal is and and if you end up with somebody other than the ACLU and how it works out I can be instructive to all of his own place\nAnd not be the only one yeah\nOkay thank you very much Patricia again good luck with that ah you know the something you want to jump on right now David and Gary Indiana David what's up\n[noise] I ... wish I wish I had better news from Indiana\nBut ah ah you meant a great palaces on a couple of weeks ago and\nShe was on this journey into the first twenty minutes on the list\nAnd yeah it's a very informative but uh you know we have a super majority here in the state of Indiana and it's a it's not just the merciless effectiveness of interstate cross check we also are a secretary of state tiny Lawson as little as six weeks ago\nOr wanted to reach and figure our precincts in Lake County which were somewhat of a suburb of Chicago we're just right over the border wanted to reach and figure our precincts\nWhat's under six hundred people now get Lake County Indiana where I live in areas and that is predominantly over eighty seven percent Democrat so uh makes perfect sense so\nAreas largely black to is it not\nYes yes it is yeah uh where I Lived in Gary is eighty seven percent African American right but there there are certain things we can do if I could give a website that you could actually check and see check your status\nAnd if you're registered Cher it's Indiana voters dot I. N. dot Gov or that and it's very very easy to serve a very basic information\nAnd if I complete you or your listeners\nThat's incredible that right oh the Saudis are protecting Trump now truck Trump is protecting the Saudis and Trump has apparently benefited to the tune of millions of dollars from the Saudis over the years um by tens of millions of dollars and a ... you know now we've got this report from the New York times that he is a fraud and a tax the cheat\nOr that he that he has committed multiple felonies but his entire family has participated in the guys are con artist\nI mean you know the Trump crime family has extensive that his daughter was lying to investors about the the number of apartments that they had sold and buildings and so the investors invested in the buildings and the the the trumps walked away with thirty to fifty million dollars in the investors got screwed\nOn apparently his daughter is a ... as well obviously if you're a Christian or when a jury pushers dad went to prison for being a graft or I mean we've got the entire rest of their family here and there are tied in with the Saudis\nWell you you said it better than I could have a whole list of things\nAnd now there are eleven senators now no none of them are Republican but I Do want to know the two Republicans Senator Rubio and Senator Graham have come out rather aggressively about doing something about Saudi Arabia but ... senators have asked in a letter\nTo the president or they want to know information about the business relationship\nOf the Trump corporation with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and one of the reasons uh of course the president cited that we need to uh you know basically be calm about this because we need to have the Saudis help us with the Iranians how on earth the Saudis can help us with the Iranians\nIs beyond me the Saudis want to go to war with Iran and sort of way they want us they\nWould they want us to do it too of\nCourse to the to the last American soldier or\nRight they don't have a military now this has changed dramatically\nIronically the death of ... a ... and so unfortunate and so horrific how they killed him\nYou know it was not an accidental a situation going wrong from an interrogation they were cutting off finger after finger until they they cut off all his fingers it took seven minutes for him to die and that was not an interrogation gone wrong that was torturing premeditated murder\nAnd also the person who flew from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was the personal head of a security for the crown prince so these this was well planned\nTo the level of the crown prince out Bob what do you think about this guy who died in the car crash here and there's the suspicious car crashes are thirty one year old air force lieutenant in the Saudi air force who are I'm Sorry I lost his name here but uh he apparently was it was either associated with her was part of his Fifteen man hit team\nOr do you think that uh maybe he was just killed off and now they're going to blame it on him\nWell you know that's possible look they are not going to come out and say we you know plan this chick cetera now they will eventually dumped the crown prince if in fact there's enough pressure put on them that's how they'll take care of this to to basically depots him\nAnd then put somebody else in his place because it is a business Cancun they don't care about women's rights they don't care\nAbout it he's going to fight I mean you know he he locked up all his peers in the in the hotel there and and tortured one of them to death and and shook him down for apparently hundreds of billions of dollars I mean he's got to be he's got two of consolidated both his wealth and his power in ways that make it much more difficult to do that than it might have been before he did this\nWell that's true now all the businesses that you read that have pulled out of this by the way now our secretary of treasury after all everybody else pulled out and after a lot of heat has now said he won't go over there but he waited ... that's the whole point of this\nYear I'm files encourage waiting\nAnd waiting and waiting on this\nThis is the fact is a business connections makes us a whole different world and if you didn't have that business connection as president\nBombay thank you\nEyes in the sky famous you will fall whistle blower who claimed that he saw top secret NASA photos showing alien structures on the far side of the moon has died in a horrible bike accident\nFormer U.S air force ...

that day we're talking about friday the twelfth of October ...\nWoman and the mother and wife are in Sims Barry Connecticut got up at six AM she was standing in her bathroom and suddenly realize that there were bright lights being shown on the floor of the bathroom ...\nWhich uh flabbergasted or because uh she lives out in about an aide acres of rural land forested land there shouldn't have been any lights on our bathroom floor\nShe walked in the window and looked up\nAnd to use her term was George tour utter shock and amazement she saw a rectangular craft with eight rows of lights running down the eventual surface of it moving over or how slowly headed for a row of trees and\nWithin thirty seconds or a minute it just disappeared from her site ... or she did hear a home and that\nRaises the specter of a possible blimp\nWe haven't checked on blimps yet but a very interesting report\nPosted to our website and her illustration of what she saw on the bottom of that craft is posted to our home page of UFOs center dot com\nOr four days later a gentleman was leaving work and Madison, Wisconsin and he writes\n... when he was a he looked up in the sky you saw white craft coming at him in a in the sky of course he assumed that it was an aircraft to party in Dane County airport near Madison\n... but the more you look at it the more intriguing became because he couldn't stand the engines you couldn't see any wings couldn't see a tail or windows and he pulled it it was so intriguing and he pulled us car off the roadway and share and looked at it\nAnd it was at that point he realized that it was symmetrical they was tapered both in the front and back that just strict off across as an ad in the northwestern sky and disappeared from from his site\nNext report was from the next day October seventeenth woman was sitting in Nashville, Tennessee eating or lunch sitting in her car on the edge of a park\nAnd she suddenly her attention was suddenly drawn to a very very bright sparkling craft\nA sphere hovering motionless in the sky as she watched this object intrigued by it she realize there was a blue one approaching the silver one from the for writing and the red one from below the silver sheer ascending\nThey all joined up and the shame smaller the sky shop there for thirty seconds or so and then all of them suddenly moved off in the daytime sky this was twelve

somebody cared about\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you receive any kind of messages or you receive anything at all you always have to have a blessing person you

a book companion the phrase probably most of us\nChildhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a big face\nBecoming sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through

you\nThat's invisible companion George was the older brother younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up\nHis younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is we have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odd conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to the youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten that can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that it's one of the things going on in dreams is we traveled beyond our often read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in a lot of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now I'm maybe erotic the ... so\nThat part about dream traveling mainstream ... also means that in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survive physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area uh so\nThe idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as little bubble up from the personal self conscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received as the patients for people to come cooling those people to come calling might be plugged cleared ... family members or ancestors of spiritual guy some kind or another so\nDream travel means we get up that we get beyond the body and the brain we get into the whole field of non local mind the science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey\nI'd also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows that dreams are wild and writes down will notice that they dream of and before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reverse the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we all said travel to the ... from this life and promote the lives who've learned about connections with drama is playing out and other realities another time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to the U.S and understanding\nAbout the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experiences papa dream travel and my story is in the book come absolutely and entirely from my end experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use the story of\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nThink we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of soul and\nSpirit because one of the things that dreams do is they connect this to a deeper source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the oil and remind us is one of the reasons why\nMost human kill human couches across history about dreams and dream if they believe the tree was put you in touch with the guard or because if you like but you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big cells\nAll the highest so so we might be liking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions an attitude trauma death on a more objective perspective then we can manage droughts filled in indigenous people say if you lost your dream\nYou've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities of the one called ... takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience I've lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of water really means to be a human\nA fully alive human I think it's actually it's important that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made a socially rewarding oath on the sheer drapes I mean we have good ways of talking about dreams nice but it's when you're a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell it\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a tree the table I invented a very simple full step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes a bond you can get it done and minutes you get some help with the package your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habit to pot and that is out of the lead also get rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get a job or deal with the family\nWhen we think that we should lie in bed and paying it to eight dollars or whatever that penny attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch a good time to back on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that the just cos team because they're awake in the middle of the night instead of losing that\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams giving us a little ring pictures a possibility that we cannot none of us because we're not young enough but not rich and not whenever find the right below the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't\nThink we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space what we would like to see an are waking life these of some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the the simple just in that I also you can get your dreams back you could stop dreaming again\nIn the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with you might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then the you can

about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and as a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor for England he was complaining of the breakfast table oh Robert why do I keep having the same as seeing dream when I got to do my medical exams\nFor Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is to say ... very close to the same dream it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a tree movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through it and you're trying to get you to understand the situation I'm trying to educate you ought to me you might have some clue about what's going on they've tried to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I might of the stories\nI I picture I sort of dream production movie company

back to coast to coast Robert ... with us his latest work is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the twenty fifth published the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\nOut on a short of that that's still pretty prolific do good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works that\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy and a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams is an\nAbsolutely and you lifted some really interesting areas for example in terms of how\nI think one of the things going on and dreams of that body talk as well as the old joke in other words and dreams we've see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example the front and center the idea is that a dream my gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show a symptom that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms\nBecause I'm from the ... the ... and and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health I'll dreams which shows the things that helped us to get wild him to stay well and and it was acting up on those dreams and try and bring their energy true you mentioned connecting with other people will you know to let the the\nWhich literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact the surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family well by common colds or whatever I'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming\nOr interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream as a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more than look at what's going on\nDon't you have what used to be cold and it's been cold again stupid normal capacity the abnormal\nThey're not super natural but that beyond the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition until after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to able to see things at a distance but I go to connect with other people\nThese are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that you are growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life I in terms of creative solutions for things ... to live with them if you can find a solution for problem ordinary life put the question to your dreams and see what come\nAnd I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for the U.S not just about what happens when you close your eyes and what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the festival this is\nBut the world around you once again we'll speak to you like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people many of my story is done on this\nOn at all and you're living in tents and after that I picked\nThe common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I\nSaid well this is pretty sentiment it's cold and Alice in wonderland the the white queen ... the white clean screams before she ... she doesn't have to screen when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing\nI had a reaction in my high blood pressure to engines that before it took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden phenomena pre sentiment on just the patriots symptom beside but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I said so I think that we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nBut we know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it you know of a sudden medic responses and we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel with that feeling in our body as well so that part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that right\nWell I did dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way you're going to take action that will empower your life and brings them Gaelic energy and guide in July from your tree I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also a method of lose the freebie you call it ... medical dreaming we my favorite way of talking on the loose in treatment that\nIs to start out leads to the state loses what does that need it means that we use shut many from being in the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure steel industry let's go on with the three let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff's going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on his side and grounded might need I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream of spreading marrow someone else so that's an example of traumatic loose a treat me another example is the I encourage people to spend a lot more time than that risky try like states\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely\nYou get into the grid and naturally so I encourage people to buy anything about being awake in the middle of the night relax into that they make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like a ten to the images that ride the ball and see what he wanted to make one of the things will come to you both to lose dreaming and finally\nActive premier the method is all about treating with your eyes wide open we go out and look at but it's the outlook beside the books in the world around you so this is a program on the map but\nAll attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us ... ... basically\nI I don't think the leading I think that you know the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret provided to interpret according to the wrong stand it I think that their dreams and then those ...\nI mean we can pick up the night floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up some of the\nOther entities from whether they're a bit confused or militias that that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any along with that is truly are owed\nCan be worked in the ... the hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible horrible\nBut by learning to go back inside the dream and he's doing it wrong you might find that behind something that ... you and your dream is the power power of understanding of how that might\nGive you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream of nothing but a rush to interpret according to narrow

recruiting dreams versus I'm very and hence the streams um and whether\nThey can either pattern or you just maybe we'll remember them to a curse several times\nSo a in a nutshell um since I was a little kid I was a um\nA something that would be near and dear to your uh uh thought George I'm basically leading a bunch of people across the cornfield after basically I guess in E. M. P. mhm I was a kid so I wouldn't have known anything about that this wouldn't have\nMade any that there are no cars that were if we were watching we were all looking up in the sky and seeing these swarms of a I don't know light basically like a near earth orbit kind of battle for\nUh uh I don't know satellite battle or something like that and ... and we're all kind of downtrodden and I keep having the damn dream\nAnd cognitive ... and you you saw the future\nMaybe I Hope not [laughter] I knew of not as well and then also and and I mean we're going to try to stop all of a cornfield ... and I'm ... and we're we have to make it north and I don't know what else from that I can give you and then also\nUm um uh the one that keeps popping up is basically my own debt which which hopefully not but I'm\nI'm doing some work at my father's place in the north woods and\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone and I sat down with one bag light in the middle for on each corner and I realize that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away um I Know that I'm gonna get hit with either a mess or something\nOr ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality\nWhere they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think ...\nWell I think it's possible that you were dreaming of future development and technology and in other ways that might manifest sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary on at the yet and hopefully you went back to you it's\nPerfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible but the dreams have a symbolic may\nNot be able to me but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of a of a situation with the very serious and dark and threatening going across the corn ... and seeing this may be EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic is something the lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional for ... or something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching the preparing me for an emotional situation\nWhich you're not a literal situation which I Need to be ready for I don't know but that comes to my mind the upside down cell phone you know I just want holding that image I realized that might be something larger more scary than a cell phone but I sort of want to reach into that dream and grabbed a cell phone let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end\nBut this is the way that I Am about treats I probably would I rather liked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary\nBut if it's my dream my actually however many years since the dream\nI didn't want to reach into the dream grab that cell phone hold it to my ear and say who is that joke to me while you and see what I gather it might be that it's the kind of voted which you can talk to someone on the other side of deaf in our dreams where often people are often talking to the debt on phones all receiving phone calls from them I sort of wanted to go that direction with that tree\n... dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in the parables and things like that why isn't that just so obvious\nWell I think that actually took the the dream Solis says the dream sauces I mean many sources of priests to try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily\nBe a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end\nBut this is the way that I Am about treats I probably would I rather liked the idea of the upside down cell

phones are receiving phone calls from them as sort of wanted to go that direction with that tree\n... dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in the parables and things like that why isn't that just so obvious\nWell I think that actually took the the dream ...\nThe dream sources of many sources of freedom to try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily is not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams or experiences of whatever report we we quote to each other from the dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the three I don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the tree take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quick you determine whether the litter little symbolic you can fill in some of the get\nWhen you learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream I I and once we understand\nThat I think one of the songs you are playing though something about living a whole life yeah plus the the in your dreams I mean once they understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes ticked off time we can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back the dreams of only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond our memories of the tree and bring back more in

is that time again flu season and so let's talk a bit about it and just while we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control doctor leads the gross golf a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season what it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October\nUm but right now we just can't predict what the coming season is going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExactly and for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty Thirteen there's somebody may need to realize and that is that a flu virus was the very sneaky thing which keeps changing on his\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and\nThat's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season and to the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be the thing that we are going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nThat look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's have your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um\nThe activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly in his under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could\nHave you know if you take any individual what individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm\nEven previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there are more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available

innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in the like well now they want to Ninety One\nBut the way I did Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nYou want if you want rex Rick Scott has killed himself and on such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all

know one thing I'm a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be honest the talk a good game and just they're lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that is why project parrot talks catching rather than on tape and his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not going to support Kavanaugh he's not going to\nBe I hadn't really thought of it [noise]\n[noise] I just can't believe he even actually\nBut [noise] we're still like I don't understand what you're getting smaller\n\nMeasures again\nGreat [laughter]\nThe people

accused of domestic violence and Missouri candidates a Claire McCaskill has been accused of domestic violence and as one company one victim blamed a woman who sued for sexual misconduct oh I Wonder if

Podesta group saying just don't ever talk about immigration to get off the topic at the end and and talk about anything else because they won't open borders they want sanctuary cities they want amnesty they want to thank jury said they made a political calculation that that's going to benefit them down the road\nTo ... you know literally and other Democrats are now saying they want their crumbs back they want to repeal the tax cuts that set off the booming economy we haven't seen that it's betting records\nFor decades and she wants to stop and you want to replace the tax cuts with cash\nPayout for the poor and working class well fifty percent of taxpayers in America pay nothing we already have redistribution the crumbs go to businesses the middle class Americans one two

Supreme Court\nMan identified as Ronald ... writes the of Smithtown Long Island\nLeft more than ten threatening bows voice mails at the offices of two senators who are not identified according to the U.S attorney's office or the eastern district of New York\nI it's about time we hope people responsible member all the time we have these uprisings looting rioting\nRemember remember what happened and burgers and Baltimore you know we never do we never follow up we have all the videotape\nOf everybody that then they're looting we see them well they don't have a map gone you know we see their faces we know we can find out who they are we never follow up\nI mean if somebody's willing to threatened to kill a politician I don't care if it's a Republican or Democrat they need to be arrested and put in jail you're not allowed to make bread and sold all conservative groups you know good to the conservative movement none\nIf you're on tape acting like a lunatic if you're out there causing violence leave your hands in your pocket keep your hands to yourself you want to win you can go out there and Eighteen days and cast your vote that's our system works\nUnlike Michael Moore ... uh and uh\nWhat's the latest one oh Rosie O'Donnell where Rosie O'Donnell I mean just the just the following in the footsteps of Michael Moore and Alec Baldwin\nCame into other things it on the things that you probably know about him when he was elected what I wrote on Twitter was we should impose martial law actually make sure that the Russians were involved\nIn the final tallies Martin Lawrence indicted Thirteen Russians transcendental and people were like martial law and what's wrong with you here alone and take you know he wants to tend to not turn to the border town I Would have been in the military to the White House to get [laughter]\nWhoa whoa whoa\nWhoa you're getting up there on NBC News Tom Brokaw you're proud of your network\nYou proud of NBC News what has become\nUm extraordinarily dangerous as you can see the violence the mobs ramping up violence was election day near near as we got investors business daily they've noticed the Democratic party\nKeeps ramping up their rhetoric Maxine Waters get a crowd get your friends you follow the follow them into grocery stores department stores gas station and you tell them they don't want it any anywhere anymore\nYou know get in their face Cory Booker says ... Eric Holder says you know I don't want to play ... ... you know we Hillary Clinton dopey civil\nAbsolute environment they're creating and you've got other sort of my favorites is was time magazine New York times or their magazine or just when you thought the left wing nuts couldn't get any ... year magazine reporting a bunch of Trump ... ... jobs in Brooklyn New York or turned the witchcraft and an effort to remove Brett Kavanaugh's\nFrom the Supreme Court what is that what the Democratic Party now which is Washington Examiner pointing out that Christian cinema and Arizona on top of you know her saying it's fine to join the Taliban and and while her opponent was fighting that war\nMartha McSally rightly asking for an apology you know the same woman calling the meth capital of the world the people of Arizona crazy\nThat same woman radical leftists biting the blind shakes radical attorney accused of taking messages from the blind shake just supporters that are also violent I remember that case well Andy McCarthy prosecuted that case anyway a bookstore Brooklyn is holding a public event\nTo put a heck of a huge which crap against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh is happening next Saturday Night\nWhich was in the audience there you go as your opportunity Larry sabotage do House Democrats are close to winning control the house he says but the latest University of Virginia analysis shows the race is\nA done deal this is now I Would take this as you better listen you're going to wake up in Nineteen days were watch TV at Eighteen days in the Nancy Pelosi's your speaker he says the race by race analysis\nOf Democratic House target shows the party's close to winning the majority but they don't have it put away in our judgment\nThat the coyote conduct who's the managing editor of sabotage those crystal ball in fact district by district previews showed that the Democrats in a worst case scenario could be four seats shy of the needed twenty three to install below sea is speaker\nThat's how close it is you can't say you weren't worn\nThat how close these house races are your vote for pillows the you vote for any Democrat you're voting for ... if you don't show up you're given a half a vote to ...\nIt was one day a year if you can't get your ass out of bed take the time and make it better government and keep progress going you will get the government you deserve don't blame me I'll Fight if if she's the speaker I'll be here every day fighting\nTrying to stop whatever sanity they want to pull on the country they're endless investigations their possible impeachment\nNot sure this is so good we go back to Texas for a minute it appears that the ... so I was not a big fight with on Hannity um and he said they're not illegal they are migrants I'm like well you enter the country illegally and you don't respect her laws and sovereignty that illegal or violence\nLaws no they're not offering like yes they are they're illegal anyway it appears that sent the Fox the same guy that famously said the country will not be bleeping pay for President Trump's border wall announced that\nA quote great American fantastic Democratic Senate candidate bad or wrong that nice the guy that doesn't want borders and American borders security is supporting beta\nIn Texas will stay there for a minute no being used in Beaumont tomorrow might as well talk about more of them but there's this caravan as we speak so you know there's a caravan of four thousand migrants from Central America fast approaching our southern border for a showdown\nAll because Democrats refused to secure the border that's why we're in this predicament\nAnd even after the president offered what a deal on dreamers in exchange for the border wall president spent three and a half billion each twenty five billion to secure the border is what the Democratic Party once\nAttempt to joint stare the judge said he is and that they're not sure would would talk to the names of dollars of\nHands on the um the crowd someone when the one million dollar ...\nOr their works relief dodging money doing the math that student word ...\nI think I have to pass through laughing now but it was house\n\nBorder so I Would have been in the military\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between when enda than his Republican opponent of opponent and now it's showing up at the polls are dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America's than John and you were right\nI fortunately I my dad is a seven has moved pretty decisively Republican I don't have a New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite John I think are moving in what I think\nIs the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona with both of those are the terrier rabid above it from my perspective you know last\nWeek I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican is all it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes then and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look I yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers ... or\n... or send an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base\nAnd and the Republicans need to break up because\nA nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually I might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did in its purest of backfired particular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out those Trump voters those independents and Democrats supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats\nAnd it's probably the only shot they have a winning the house that down and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most unpopular\nPart let me tell you what I'm saying on radio and TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five\nCongressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for below sea it'd be a stay at home it's I have a vote ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for a pastor and McCaskill and cinema and again the inhaler and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know bread on the news just a pony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn and you know you'll get the government and you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're going to they're going to tow the line with below sea in the house and told the line\nWith humor in the Senate that you know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations they want to raise taxes they're actually saying that\nThey're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it anymore John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats you're not talking about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary state that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that not\nThat didn't work for eight years dug and the\nWhite white dog when we were told him to a bit of a leading Indiana is saying he buys you say go for the wall and he said you know if each which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you got a libertarian in that range that is polling at nine percent you'd take the libertarian out at the Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we'd be doing a lot better I think you're probably agree with that on\nHow is it possible that Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me\n... all one word answers on those money\nRaising enough money yeah\n... that's what it's all about and and and and he's absolutely right because Shawn that when we asked in September and the national poll that there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want to ask you close your speaker done only twenty three percent of all voters said yes\nFifty six percent said no but then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that they're chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi\nOr a moving older folks to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters some think Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates\nAnd let me tell ya ah for for ... for someone who's involved in your rational races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars to the races right now\nWhat are the patio and he used to have home with his project very toss released to tapes and they are stunningly you know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely\nOrganized a campaign to lie\nTo the people a tendency in the case of bread I said to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of Claire McCaskill just say one thing ... privately another thing publicly\nIt tells me Democrats too when they have to they can expose who they are if they can't talk about impeachment which they want they can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that\nI mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor on us the character and integrity hope\nYou are exempt me from being a person\nDumped you but you know nobody I've been listening to you because they were listening to you we'd have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you I take that as a real from the fact that I mean not on sale radical left oh are you I'm I'm Better right listen I your your style a Democrat listen this is a party that kicked out Joe Lieberman\nLieberman is one of the most these men ever\nYou know it's very very top of his great on on national security issues\nHorrible on social issues nicest person in the world but he's not left enough for the Democrats and they threw him out and he came back and won but I mean\nIt's everything you need to know about the modern radical Democratic Party of ... and they're handling the ... Democrats would be better without their rights they will take a break and we'll come back for a duck shown\nAnd John McLaughlin are pollsters are next half hour we got a lot more to get into later on Michael Dell and Dr Sebastian Gorka will join us up Bill O'Reilly is going to check in with us today is book a skyrocket it right the number one on the New York times list in week one can Raj elites\nThere's another town hall more interviews and a lot of fun it's open to the public and it is free\nSo all the details up on Hannity dot com or we welcome back to the program Bill O'Reilly or with a big congratulations to him as a we had him on a soldier I picked up his new book killing the as the as the hunt for the worst war criminals in history\nAnd it has debuted now number one on the New York times bestseller list the whole killing series that he has put together non fiction by the way\nA when you look at it is is the most successful biggest selling a group of history books that have been written and sold in history as well so\nYou can get it on Bill O'Reilly dot com and Amazon dot com bookstores everywhere and and we have it up on our website Hannity dot com or congratulations to you so that's a that's a testament to how great this book series is done and I told you I couldn't put the book down now finished it it's amazing\nThank you very much for reading it had any I Know how busy you are you have to fight a lots of a bad guys so the fact\nThat you know no drama which is really a compliment to me aren't you know there's there's not a lot like millions of bad guys you know ... I don't know\nI mean how do you know I uh we go way back and ah we started at the Fox news channel it was basically or not this way in America the hate was nearly as intense you'd agree with that right\nUnder present the numbers on this path\nSo ... what happened was that as a Fox News channel became more successful um and the country started to fragment\nUm than individual people like Kennedy and me and Laurie Ingram we became targets and and we our lives changed I mean remember going in there and I'm Sorry I'm telling your audience does but I have to I remember going to see a Tom jones concerts and the United sitting there and the second\nRound that we do know how humiliating as soon as they were\nBoth speaking at a restoration weekend\nOf Atlantic City in Atlantic City and ride it was just in the beginning right hand type jobs it no I Do work and women were throwing stones at him and then when we throw snow cones\nHorrible and I'm like those are the is a great performer but we were like board ah there's nothing to do oh here's free tickets to go see your show we walk in Tom jones\nSays it's not unusual it's not unusual\nThat's right I'll tell you what what motivates me and you know my background I Know your background and in many ways at similar you know a paper boy it ate a dishwasher at twelve a cook it Thirteen\nBus boy bartender then I painted houses framed houses did roofing laid piled up another decade of my life that's two decades in my life doing real work and what this is what's happened\nIs we are now not only not only demonizing people we have differences with Hillary says you can't be civil we are now criminal lightning differences you know the the whole witch hunt issue that the president talks about\nWhere the power of intelligence forces used to stop one candidate that\nThey protected from the last ... rope who committed kept felonies lined up by the courts with an verified information one opponent pays for and that disseminating it with a media strategy to make it look like something happened that didn't and after that you know two years of investigation\nThey want to destroy people they disagree with that is the modern left today I don't want to destroy anybody I don't want to boycott anybody\nI don't want people ... everybody has a choice I Can't make people watch Hannity or listen to this radio show I Do the best program but I can and and people have all the power but that's not enough for these groups\nNo because they can't when they can't they can't win on the electoral basis we saw that with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton that was the last straw for the George Soros is in the far left the media matters all of these people\nOnce they went down in the presidential election that all of them thought they were going to win because they had the media in their pocket and still do then they said you know why we got what band and I'm In the free market place we are now going assassinate people and this is very similar what happened in Germany you know bringing it back to the end\nBy the way you're not saying that you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that people today are like not the killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying propaganda Mitt observation demonization very different from saying that there are camps\nYeah I mean there's there's a lot that can happen in America thank God because our structure you still in place to prevent anything like that happening\nBut I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros behind the scenes with tens of millions of dollars alright funneling into agencies that are\nBent on destroying human beings are we talked about this last time I was on a program what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery American should pay attention to that because of that guy can go down on on Robin are uncorroborated than anybody in this country can and as you rightly pointed out to try to with Trump on Russian collusion that's\nCollapsing all over the place the fusion GPS guy put out dot dot CA taking the Fifth Amendment now won't testify what does that tell you okay so you know we're living in a dangerous time\nLet's let me introduce us to this you're I'm agreeing with you that that what really got exposed\nTo me that scares me a lot and there's two things one is we ever do justice system we don't have equal justice or equal application of our laws needs to be looking at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever\nBut the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh\nAbandon all principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served do so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republicans for the first time in their life that something right they handled it with\nThe serious that is the topic deserves they were thorough they did it right and at the end of the day there was no corroboration to the allegations being made\nAnd now we see people like what Eric Holder kick 'em we can't be civil Hillary Clinton getting their fates Cory Booker or Maxine Waters you see these cabinet people you get a crowd and you follow them into in the grocery stores department stores gas stations and you tell them\nWe don't want to know where any more that's what she said no\nWe're going to use its amusing that you ran down the list and uh we are we could add ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke about the Republican candidate for Senate they're um\nSlam dunk ... a reporter [laughter] you know and it was obviously set in jest and no press goes why all crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over law\nCrisis a record numbers of migrants record a foreign secretary better grand I spoke about the importance of stopping the flow before reaches the U.S

predictions I Want just like the idiots on TV that have been telling us for a year I always believed that the media wants to depress any sense of hope that people won't show up that's not the case we know in twenty sixteen\nUm but I think now Kavanaugh caravan and and the exposed lies in the real agenda or the Democrats are trying to hide they have to lie to win that's that's the saddest part of that\nParty low it is on the ground with the radicals are taking control of the Democratic party when you have people like Maxine Waters thing around members of the Trump Administration than you know that they're that they're just thinking of his father but show let me let me give you a sense of what what do you say the beginning of the shows that you have all the troubles\nOr no no no get let not

we're going to have or we can't allow the state and use the dust complex to get a sound we've got to get out that the vote are going to take off for instance\nIt's going to be really simple but yeah they're going to be happy the night of election night you've got to be sad that night or you it's got to be mixed results and my answer is why don't you go and when it all\nI'm like a wedding uh and the ... think of what Trump can do is if Mueller is leaking that the thing is now coming to an end and there's no Trump Russia collusion which I've been telling everybody for two years\nSo now we're
