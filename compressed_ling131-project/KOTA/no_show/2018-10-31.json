absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table\nThat Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right oh God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the left so want\nThey want they want is kind of take those issues away and I neutralized Trump on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you\nYeah and and that won't work immigration you know he's a Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told\nNot to mention it right by all the head honcho there's an article in this deal yesterday the Democrats are just sarcastically\nCaving on these issues and just saying that well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why starting out there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district\nSo yeah you're right that the kids were loading up what Twenty one trillion in debt and then catch and release you know these are all children of God coming across the quarter right like the Catholics are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill rights and you run those basic issues by that by\nThe taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is

listening to the Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura and just a moment we're going to hit one of the most important congressional races in the United states and this is a district in New Jersey New Jersey's eleventh and just a moment before we do let's go to Barbara in Texas line three Texas has its share of\nBirth motel and birth tourism meaning people from other countries who are not us citizens coming to this country for the sole purpose of having a child and then snagging that a gold standard of all passports a U.S passport meaning US citizenship for a child\nAnd some cases going back home and then later applying for other benefits college or perhaps even avoiding the draft and your own country\nBarbara whole I'm from South Texas in my family is from Switzerland and Norway well my great grandparents were immigrants here will have killed them fourteen children they were farmers they get their work they did their stuff when they didn't cheat\nAnd here we are now I'm really sick and tired I've been working on my lap along as as well as my children and when we do our part but what is the deal that somebody can sneak in\nSit down and pop out a baby and you get everything you watch\nWell I think they are ill yeah they'd cut it down to the issue of basic fairness and there's a clause in the fourteenth amendment of the constitution that our previous guest Mark Krikorian rates the cause is subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre so those were subject to the jurisdiction there or not to get too much in a legal leads but the court has never ruled on what that actually means does that mean\nA ministers of other countries who are here working legally does it mean I'm ... and other countries who are here and then when they have children what is exactly that referring to that the language is not clear cut and so the court has ruled on\nI think trumpet smart the court should rule on this because most people if you put this up to a national referendum not that that's how we do business here it is and but if you put it up to a national referendum this would be an eighty twenty issue by far people will test is ridiculous and\nThat's why a Britain Spain Germany Switzerland Sweden none of them have a birthright citizenship as it's being interpreted by the left in the United states or let's go to Jay Webber Jay ... is a running for Congress lemon district of a New Jersey it's an open seat\nOn the current um incumbent Republican Rodney Franklin send is retiring\nAnd this is critical the races very tight uh he's been subject to a violent threat his family has uh just the mere fact that he's running for office in New Jersey I and we're delighted to talk to him J uh this is a tight race and your opponent making Cheryl\n... is hoping to keep the corruption machine don't I guess in New Jersey just keep that keep the liberal liberal party rule going\nYeah that's their plan certainly I mean anytime you support Bob Menendez for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics so\nTell us what happened ah yeah I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\nYeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn sign stuck in an envelope and then uh enclosed with a a a letter suggesting that um my seven children would be an lucky if I were to win and uh it was you know disturbing\nA law enforcement been fantastic uh they're on the case of making the kids feel really really safe and secure and my wife and I look at each other's or what do we do about it you know we're going to get to make sure the kids are safe and then a bit of pushback and we're just not going to be intimidated by some ... to ah you know jobs things in the mail and hides so we're going to\nKeep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back and stayed up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district you know what you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent of the media and the left the resistance are\nGeared up their jacked up to try to uh run the tables in congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of its economy are incredibly strong ah\nAnd despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all\nOf these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district the wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up but so are we and you'd always jacked up the taxpayers begin screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it and the state has gotten more and more on affordable with every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here jacket up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or much let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes or that people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction we're drawing and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nHike taxes around here and then the blame\nSomebody else in Washington it's\nNot going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and its support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nI ... I just your subject caught my interest today because the my husband just retired rule\nWill be my friend can't hear you very well it's got to speak up\nI either lower and this is Stephanie from Iowa I'm your subject caught my interest in any you know my husband just graduate or just retired from the air force after twenty three years\nAnd we were stationed over in Holland when our child was born in two thousand and three and you know he was out to me than than you know they had the ... the mom and dad had to me it's been it's been in order for the child to have ...\nAnd you know it's like most countries in the world just because you're president in the country and you have a child doesn't mean that child get citizenship of that country it\nMakes cents a can of Texas line three kind of\nYeah first time caller Laura listen this is a question\nWhere is the money that the United states has been sending all these years and now currently and Trump wants to get you know take it away\nWhere is it going why are they feed their people over there so poor no job that that's why they're trying to do this law here to get it to the United states\nSomebody is getting them money and pocketing it after we've always said with my mom and dad gain year\nCame here legally adopted a second war got married and everything and then we came along my older brother my older sister and the baby of the family okay now\nThing is they came here legally lego league okay and now we're here\nI'm living in Texas but that's my question I've been watching all the two things okay and I've been I've been writing down on a book now all these questions as an attorney and a court room to get answers where is just one\nThing or they went the other day that goes to the local um now the the national governments and then they distributed in ways that they think are the best I'm sure there's a lot of corruption I'm sure a lot of it is wasted\nBut they have the Guatemala think got sixty nine million dollars watch or it's slated to get sixty minute sixty nine million dollars this year and a and the scope of what that is it's actually not that much like in in terms of remittances back to home countries back\nTo where the big money is at immigrants here in the United\nStates both legal and illegal sending money back to their countries of birth\nOf apt in the billions twenty billion dollars a year to Mexico alone every year in remittances that means wire transfer money going back home\nA Donald Trump could tax that he could he could push for some type of government fee on that too may help pay for security costs or\nWhatever you want to describe it as the costs of having to deal with this crush at the border there are ways to fund enhanced border security I and I think that the Trump team is smart enough to figure that out but I Would go after those remittances absolutely don't go away\n\n\nAging is inevitable ladies and gentleman in the past it's been the jaw line and

injuring police officers police are responding\nOr yesterday that Molotov cocktails had been thrown by some of these migrants in this a mass deporting people smaller than the current caravan\nOf four thousand but it's still sizeable uh so the president's wrote a whole bunch of different ideas and we'll talk about them now with Katie Waldman from the department of homeland security where she is the

had the president of yesterday saying that they're not coming in\nA but isn't it a fact though that you know asylum still does offer a way in for even people who are part of this large mass of people I mean they know that and that's why they're all they're all reciting the same lines that would allow them to pass an initial credible fear screening\nThat's right the word is definitely out and these migrants know that if you say the magic words I'm scared you have a free ticket to enter our country and in the meantime while you're in Maine here you were also given a work permit\nYou know it's born out in the fact is that before twenty Thirteen one out of every one hundred arriving aliens claimed credible fear today that is one out of every ten ... we're just not seeing that same correlation and both the economic security and or homicide and or violence in Central America but what is out is that there are serious\nWide open loopholes in our immigration law and these aliens are well coached and they know that if you say the magic word you're given a ticket in\n... well the fact of the matter is uh Mexico has confirmed Mexican official speaking to me last week confirmed that there were a Honduran left wing politicians one of them was removed from the caravan along with a couple of other associates a who is an opposition leader\nWas actually working in concert with Venezuelan\nA bullet politicians and getting help and comfort from groups within the United states who also have been aiding uh these masses of people as well so there's a\nComplicated Web of

not give these special rights\nI'm but our message is simple and our message is clear we will not allow a large group an authorized\n... migrants to enter the U.S an unsafe for unlawful manner we've already seen these groups for say break immigration laws and Mexico and Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics as you mentioned\nAgainst both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week that we will ensure that our men and women on the front lines to protect and defend it and the president has done so in calling up\nThe military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to not only secure the border but defend our men and women on the front line\n... have you I'm prepared already oh and homeland security with the\nChance that the president was referencing yesterday that there you're going to announce started housing people intent so they will not be released into society at large does as they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal alien ...\nThroughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit the words out Laura I mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase and family at apprehensions and the last five years\nWhere I record number of family unit apprehensions this year alone what that says if you have a child with you we have to release you went to the interior\nThere's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before we're not able to detain them and immediately return\nWith our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress ... there's\nNot much we can do in the way of deterrence to immediately apprehend and repatriate which ... which is border security\nWhere if there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct correct\nAnd we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a pretty decent percentage\nWell record low a male um of\nAdult apprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one at the last time we were at this low in terms of adult apprehension ... so that's the only and you're able\nTo deliver a consequence

people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing healthcare healthcare other we welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us\nBut they have people that gave us a give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the\nThe deficit and the debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean and what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shock\nAnd correcting the record with these lies in its textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that\nAnd then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections sport layers of it in our Republican health care bill\n... what's in lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats there's always the same I even think it's gotten worse in a look at the this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but out they're blaming Donald Trump for it and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nFor Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable along so well it's interesting I'm so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out spend about four to one from my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast a message over money and results right\nResults look what we have done with this economy on the national international stages well uh with the president and when it comes to sitting down with North Korea\nHeading for denuclearization or we would help or making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from

prosperity and peace um\nYou'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nI think it's not a lot of things to get our voter look I took a vote for any Democrat and any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs it was a vote for below sea because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings\nA look at the the agenda Democrat is it it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of\nMiddle class Americans they want it back they want to eliminate eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on healthcare is just\nThe definition of just that city considering they ... how many there are counties I read in Iowa that had seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider\nThat's it yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high they can't even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we had three opportunity\nJust search herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they can be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp\nFor hopefully not a Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care and of course what they've tried to keep on of the rock shot and you know this and our listeners on this impeachment ...\nKnow that and then once investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses

alternative to government run health care\nAnd um she didn't have\nMany well between his own bringing people out to vote\nAnd the campaign conventions Democrats are so sick of Menendez and they just stay home\nThat many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state or how the singer involving right now because they're very a lot of ... very much in the air\nAnd there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over one of the things stay home and then they view about run out and voted\nAnd if you end up not having one of our election they do not do anything else go day two votes which got serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder in for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans having the majority all of those points up put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as we're pretty frightening thought um\nWhere do you see the house going\nWell unfortunately um I my personal range region a bottom to own one which would mean politically which speaker of hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean Kevin McCarthy like I couldn't get there speaking um\nAnd I can't I mean in all honesty you know I've always been ... about this I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say do you see I\nCan't either I really can't I mean and I think and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea would win the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about the

for Schumer and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nMuch I just tell everybody he wanted to some of these claims or a moderate Democrat hands from the voting for for me to say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of

defeat them who's giving out here\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence because his will change more the radical we have a democratic parties in control of their party leadership\nOr is just utterly

very challenging environment I can be from California and representing California even more important reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out of that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine and ...\nIt is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now\nPossibly Gavin Newsom a it is getting more and more for double to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the ... you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of them a lot of cases Nevada\nOr that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states because if you look at it is becoming unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy our first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you're in one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if

out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this was the headline which I think is pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats than in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending nine million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is was Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for

uh how dirty politics can be fighting for the people of Washington state which is you know fairly liberal and a lot of ways like oh California's its neighbor and Oregon its neighbor\nAnyway he was a certified governor elect twice in two thousand and four than a King County literally discovered brand new balance\nThat broke overwhelmingly for the Democrats\nAnd they counted of despite the fact that it was clear in that case at least my reading of it that some felons and then that will do both people that actually voted in King County the election control systems have been sloppy\nBut you had you know groups like move on and others you know paying for a recount on the ballot and they found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nA well not connected to voters in swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened to you know\nI actually can county had more votes than voters and are they flipped it by a hundred and twenty nine votes at a to point millions eight million votes\nSlow down that how did you have more votes than voters and it'd be counted\nThat's what we questioned as well and the the the Democrat appoint a judge this year that decided that we were gonna have to prove how those votes were actually cast\nWell why wouldn't you just use the calculators we had this number of voters and the number of votes and they don't add up and that that would be well election fraud\n[noise] yeah well he called a floppy is what he called and wrote against us\nLet's talk about the eighth district out there in Washington state and uh you know how do you view the race that you're in because you're on our list of toss ups and that will tip the balance of power in six days\nWell this is one of those twenty three seats that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen that are Republican currently holds for Nancy Pelosi thinks that they're half way back to the speakership and this has been the most the most expensive race house race in America at this point I think she spent more money against me than any other person in America\nAt Bloomberg weighing in with another two or three million dollars and this last week as well um you don't many cultures you know mayor additive very Sean and I'm proud of mine\nWell you know I mean the same thing we were talking earlier maybe water or Walter season California's forty fifth district but I think there's that Michael Bloomberg is the former mayor of New Yorkers spending some nine million dollars alone in Southern California and how much of they poured into the race of negative ads against you\nIt's been it's been ... about two to one at this point not being outspent ... to wander the good news is people know me that health and so\nYou know their lives as they tell really are putting the narrative but we're all male in states every all ballots have been out for a cup\nFor a week and a half now and so every day's election day\nEvery day as election day I got the most left wing opponent I have ever had a you know she she woke up a day after Hillary lost and decided that you need to be a member of Congress and this march and more angry protests in Seattle the increase in the district\nNow thinks it hating the president and somehow a qualification to be a member of Congress Sean I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo you get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled as quick as any politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happen\n[noise] yeah it's it's it's just ridiculous that's essentially what she's running on and uh and so we're we've been doing everything from\nGoing door to door I think over eight thousand houses personally I'm a second pair of shoes or we need people to come make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come hell\nYeah what uh what do you think do you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there and\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and are in our people are voting whatsoever there's clearly asking a master so we really got to get people to Maryland I doubt anybody listening to us right now if you have senator about do it now get your family to do it all your friends get it in because\nOf the sooner comes in the same work take after list a heartless and get to the heart cases who may or may not vote unless we talk to him\nWell she's just writing it running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess he wants to impeach the president he wants to open borders she wants to crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running\nWell that is a checklist we have a few other things that are ... they were in the ad obviously we we ... we don't have a state income tax or state she favorite that that's been turned down nine times by the public a year but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nOr you know and she attack now it's time for a for not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in I lost their health care myself my wife and my my four children and I ended up with a lousy plan that cost two and a half times as much\nDidn't cover things I Want coverage covers I didn't want covered twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business we could possibly get so you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician decided for you it's called freedom\nListen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference between Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep her\nPeople will vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because the electorate speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for Schumer so I Hope the people in Washington state eighth district get out there for Dino
