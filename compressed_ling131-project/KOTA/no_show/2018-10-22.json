go\nTo the times on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big but does it feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] and it's a it's kind of odd just in like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nOr you'd never stopped working on the news you know what I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I committed much energy to it\nIn the last say seven eight years are focused on this thing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people's I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these uh these\nStories about you know something that looked like ... when you read the articles on but when you read the title of the Nineteen Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them mental folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt convincing that something over the years\nHas been around us and it's been documented in and it shows the historical aspect of most people don't understand ...\n... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big book Wildman and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year can you recap of hoop a project how you got started on that what you learn\nAnd how it kind of got its ... into you know all these years\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with the worst super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the Sierra\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they start talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter\nAnd they said you know ... we had Twenty years of police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance or you go about it at your own pace me no your kids to raise that help us out with this really we really want to find out\nAnd initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I and what about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I Want an Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history when the topic that Randy ... and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\n... ... and I coordinate on the area to her about which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was they sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some on top of graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring us together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police ...\nBackground I approached them and they said hey maybe you could break out from doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness to come forward or they're going to have to write an after David to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that there would be no question about what was stated because they cited and there'd be no question about the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there are new many of The Elders and this was so helpful and break it down the doors these guys were introduced me and say hey can trust this guy\nHe's a friend who's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard\nMaybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe a one was a store manager that ran the big story in Hooper that live miles away who saw one coming into town\nAnd starting to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness to be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements and the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something in a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native American\nAnd I found a diamond unbelievable luck and individual name Harvey ... who\nWas his sister director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and a harvest not only a world famous artists fees outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met him right away we just cook like brothers and when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery\nAnd fraud the sketch the suspect in the suspect was later caught\nI Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and a harbinger of the schedule the suspect that is how accurate the spin it and so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nYou did two books theloop a project and then we did a follow up book called tribal big where he went outside of hoop and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm\nKind of how it started\nAnd you say you don't have a dog in the fight meaty you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big one world\nOh bingo a certain I started the most vocal the most audacious\nThe most vulgar are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push back cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well you must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of background\nBut I still kept that open mind and when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who drew the sketches Harvey myself in Harvey's like Gina proud also an agent in Oklahoma\nThe Nineteen twenty two there are hundreds and hundreds of credible stories about the different creatures that sort of like an animal and what sort of like a man and close up encounters including some famous people\nAnd we're going to hear some of those stories are in a moment we're going to continue our

giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty describing these creatures people's\nWhatever you want to call them and before the break David Was explaining how easy and some colleagues had collected up a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to a very a very precise DNA kind of testing\nThe paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um observations that didn't belong in the paper but the ...\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand how it uh this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to force certified lab so ... to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same result or it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nThey went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back and there's the cetera\nAnd one of the things that no but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know about the ... well six foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs\nHair and fiber experts have a raffle all the different mammal hairs in North America and when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSoap if it if they didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using inherent fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with that is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that number did to extract this DNA and to get the result in and you\nKnow there's a lot of there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results are\nWell it's kinda like the you up a world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very turf

I don't remember where\nAnd ... in the book but there was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited lurk in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just playing with fire\nSo think about it um\nSay a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he can figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the uh it's not unusual the hunters and campers and other things in the woods of seeing these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water\nAnd um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot they think we're all must be kept\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to are generally not hostile shy when they get away from people when they encountered what they can be pretty nasty when provoke a there's a phenomenon it was reported in several these labs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder chased him off\nAnd there's one report I think it's ... I forget where it is in the book ... a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because\nWho saw how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but in the near term I've never found a big flood nowadays that conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big with missing for ... I never I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved with these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was when I get these once a year or say every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet\nThe mess keep perpetuating on the Internet and they are not true and some people believe all you know it's a cover up but as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies ...\nMost people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen\nThey will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep them clamped up so when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious ever was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them um just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't the latest news by hadn't admitted big kidnapping\nAnd I I Would have to say there's a day there are some account in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children\nYou know there are never any names attached to it though\nAnd that's that's the tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried out who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it ... ... ...\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they describe them as you know I think it's it's gay they described ms gay and I hope they get in the context of gate as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it'd look too humid\nIt defined I I have never heard of a hunter\nSaid oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot at the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman policeman incredible credible sources\nThat continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history\n... or so there's something to this\nThe ... got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know George there's this segment of the big for the world that wants to go out and kill and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality we're never going to kill him it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one way or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n... yeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man that has a lot of injury to because I've seen pictures\nAnd I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just to go through it and say oh you know it was that was a fake meant for the circuit the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\n... well I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major\nThese are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times and the and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt somebody wasn't just bone and get in or when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas ...\nUp that's not where we associate big butt sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio and Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was a center of American civilization and ...

listening to everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most annoying thing that I've heard in a long time\nSo good job on your mind and um I wanted to talk about this thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying how related wild man\nI I'm I feel like Rome are also a way that we find out more about wild land because there are Amazonian tribe that were just covered for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour ideas revolutionary and I feel like within the un years will definitely have an answer from ... and like ...\n... you're going to use drones and your race at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on this and people\nAre has worked real well and and you can't use a drone international park it's against the law there is a huge fine so probably won't happen is\nThat George Bush wanted to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should kind of touch on it for the people here your work of skin walk a ranch the researchers there I saw something very similar to a big details about that\nActually multiple times uh it's more of the tribe that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there and there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation in\nUh the dogs alerted or the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and in this thing look the officers and showing the light on it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you could hear it I mean it was just taking these giant strides in October garbage cans you had alarms going off in the police officers tasted\nAnd uh I think they they bouncer tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or are they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nHum I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we describe on the program more where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker ribs and seeing\nWhat looked like a dirty snowball light that that was voted just off the off the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it through infrared you can see the the bowl of white started stretching into what looked like a tunnel and through this tunnel this ...\nYou're started crawling they could see it and you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through a struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the at the entrance to this this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike a head with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards skin Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there and they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs are\nThe the tribe has the best a\nHandle on it and and I have seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nI Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the Patterson film is real\nOr why haven't we caught despite that on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about out of that that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this when did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching them something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back to the skin Walker day but it the the comparison is pretty clear is that that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nIf you uh had activity in one area and set a camera that would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question and one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes that you mentioned in your books suggested thing has camouflage abilities that ... I Hope it changes shapes and he can hide\nA correct that is a again one of the reasons that makes this entire different topic difficult to research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess yeah I\nTry to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big country Hey Tom how're you doing\nNow is Tom on the ... ...\nI think Tom has gone ah okay so we're about out of time to have

a re Debbie here in New York in ...\nThere I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen\nA posts are teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb in stock and\nI had to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library imagined that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything by our someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I you know I started out what I could but I thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd you know flash forward I graduated from college and\nThen will no one told the story and you know the right way and so I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet the man who survived Indianapolis and I mean I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had to spend time with them and visit them at their house they asked me to be their story teller and that's kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd when for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions and strike a blow for justice for the or some of the key characters would be an amazing draw\nFor a while it was a very exciting new project from either way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work and I had been trained to have an opportunity to work on an\nIconic for working story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis west that I'm In being Indianapolis storyteller she wanted to render the story has been replaced and she actually did that she\nWrote a an eight part miniseries and she said she had two major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we can stand up rather ... but we only big many series on foot\nSo you're going to need to write a book or I'll shoot\nA screenwriter I don't know how do I have a very family and friends she reached out and and make contact with me\nAnd I'm and she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran you didn't know that I had been trying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one I'm ... and\n... my only problem was is that all she was wanting was by a ... and I wanted to help her write the book a bell ah my joke is that I had to figure\nOut how to manipulate or into letting me help her by the eventually over the course of several months we finally met and then\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and so forth in time and then when we did a project pick on me and a half year\nSarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the people had were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you START I\nDidn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nA part of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of the ship you know she'd been reduced to a sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprint commanded most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that have participated in from her desk\nOr that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nUs acting president ever left the country on and so\nThere was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift is less than what she did a besides being stuck in a\nWhile I'll tell you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing a craft from those ships took us troops on to the shore so of course you know that the ... the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... version of what the world knows about the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that you guys have helped uncover\nA ... okay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the late ... and\nA small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle with us from our where your father drove the ranting crap and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up than the actual invasion she was getting in the shore of environment and during that time and march thing first Nineteen forty five she typed kamikaze\nNine men work still twenty six injured and that was what really center on the whole journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of them were working at a theater um victorious at open now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July ... he's Nineteen forty five\nWhen General Electric grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project looting President Truman\nDecided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb a little boy which would later ... ... ... a head to the forward area and trim and did that\nA lot of uh a lot of people don't know that for him and did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be an invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was elected to transport these as noble components of the bomb or she did that I made a record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on to play an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eight Nineteen forty five ... she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those he's he's from Guam for the Philippine an almost three west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the car seat in the middle of the Philippines the on July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight\nAnd she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called I think the a mandated by lieutenant commander Moshe ... to ... fired the

Sarah I Want to get to the moments right after these torpedoes slam into the side of the Indianapolis chaos breaks out um\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a note distress signal not exactly true but you sort of true why don't you pick up a story there are no one was described those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes yet\nMm sure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds it had been an intermittent cloudy night and a and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for ... the clouds just part of the moon came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nThe power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first time in the you know the ... the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship\nOver the speakers there was no one to help people to report to battle station they had to pass that from now about well this is six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship\nSo with the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minute we have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to help first\nThe star bird and then it goes down by the bell so men are being trapped inside the ship unable to fix it from their compartments and you know Lynn and mentioned before they believe about three hundred and then when the ship\nAnd even further this because there wasn't any direct command able to broadcast for the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way in hell ... ... ... men went down with her and were able to escape so he's been we're spread out for over a mile and a half\nOf what they believe and you know those who went down on a went off on the cyber side the low side and they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve rough that they believe got off the ship\nAnd um but no standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side ... well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in raft they were\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday that guy\nThat there were others who although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nBecause some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nOr a while the other one pour the water through it into the into his mouth\nAnd thinking that that would drain the salt out well of course that didn't ... and then others would take a mall heard is that the the water I'm hoping that no one would feed them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just began gulping it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nA blood vessels her blood cells ...\nFrom the brain on brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage lines and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water you\nYou have the the Japanese commander of who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself someone else has to be around either that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or I couldn't imagine I guess ...\nImmediately that it it sunk quickly so he leaves\nI'm ... which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off you have a somewhere I was I Would too winds up testifying in court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about if nobody paid attention we got to go to a break in about a minute\nMaybe ... or or you want to talk about that\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him in the late night troll you know just after midnight and are they the the kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is thrilled or something of that nature but ... ... ...

inevitable it let him slide given that no more it's just that did or did they have to pursue this\nReally there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is a tremendous loss for the ...\nAnd uh so many people and it was very public you know\nLike when you said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan\nWas announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets for their family is now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so you know it was obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation and started you know revealing things and who was involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the thinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\n... someone needed to be to blame a\nAnd a lot of people got wind right there were there were a lot of people who are brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that these are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation and so\nReally you know at the time these names you know admiral king and ruined the limits and all these news men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\n... and the American public who holds the men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify and tarnished our names like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially the captain is responsible for the vessel for the moment that he was\nBrought to court martial ... there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA limb let's talk about the court martial of or mentioned earlier or the unusual step of bringing to the Japanese commander in testified that has ever happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain is that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the charges um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in command her how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all for having his shit sunk\nIn World War two there were hundreds of books on cap and Charles McVeigh was the only happened here was court martialed ... scares me and I'm so he did have to charges against him one was and by the way in\nThe navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college uh and so forth and we found these records where ... navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would pick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lied to the Pacific war who were involved in the you know\nThe the commander of specific forces the commander at Guam and these were ... men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power and admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admirals are\nTheory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into open court and so that's why they were casting about for something\nThat would stick with McVeigh and to what they charged him with was\nA failure to call abandoned ship in a timely manner which was quickly just proven because there were a lot of witnesses who um I heard him call abandoned ship and then her to pass than demand the second ship as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned what's failure to think that ...\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactics whereas ship which here back and forth across the scores\nWere hoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese commander and indeed happened McVeigh kids these big has the tea bagging at evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk\nA standing orders as the military put that in her view that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have stuck day\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but\nHe was testifying in Japanese through a translator and the translator I did not translate exactly what he said it correctly and ... you could understand enough English to know that but not enough to\nReally repair the damage and also he was you know in\nThis very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either\nSide I'm ... and later interviews there I found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted with that and um he had been translated incorrectly and that I had and that had in part had been kept in fact\nHe was angry years later Sarah right at the ... the retiring of the USS Indianapolis the submarine the

five right after the court marshal so they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships namesake city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it but when he got

Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as did the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor\nSo it's an unusual race there in that um it hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty type rates well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with uh the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet so this is probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of\nEnergy and enthusiasm from voters especially females letters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women are\nShow more of a preference for a democratic controlled house and are also more energized vote this year so you know it's a truism of terms that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like a women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers\nAnd in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blowout for hitting their draw to\nSpeak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter for peace was called house races tighten as mid term elections near our data about down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman Rob Woodall\nYes so this is an interesting race I'm competing with all its definitely being outraged by Carolyn up or do who is also a professor she's at Georgia State university and um he's in the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost\nFurther down in the ticket and that I'm Mr do could benefit from that\nSo and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats\nAnd uh so does you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hearty uh and then the second ... Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jacky Rosen who's a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter] I'm at this is a little bit [noise]\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be um

said but part of this is also laying the groundwork are to blame the fad or if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets\nAnd you know even though there's some fluctuation there about why he's doing this\nIf you look at the leverage that the president has influenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people that are sit on the board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA boat every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's into doing this just to kind of up and running public criticism of the central bank\nAnd the you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the fed says presidents or criticism isn't going to change how they operate it does um you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else or as per usual when the president does something like that he started the discussion right through is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too soon or too frequent\n[noise] for exactly right people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is doing but rather than Trump\nIs um probably elevating that debate and saying look the unemployment rate slow [noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates are ... you know as as a slack disappears in the economy because you don't want to have inflation but would what President Trump is saying here as well world the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates\nThat we're not seeing an acceleration and inflation\nWas speaking with Tim arose Wall Street journal economics reporter who's ... presidents that sustains criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates the tricky balancing act there was one person who said in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be catering to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what you want\n[noise] that's right the question isn't very ah difficult right now the fed you know most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates\nSo the decisions they have to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case that you're from now let's say you're from now you have the unemployment rate continuing to fall but inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do\nAnd so the question is on a coach or you don't have as much conviction\nAbout the policy pass through the president's criticisms you get in your head at all and there are some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you are done a fire as the other side which says look if markets begin to question the feds credibility\nThan that's even worse and so it might actually stiffen their backs a little bit [noise] um but the fed so far as saying we're going to ignore this\nOr we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and if people criticize it you know then we'll deal with that\nThat

for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants you know\nBehind a chain link fence at the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nOr this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen and we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping\nThe caravan ers make their way to our southern border resident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally and he is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nOr the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want or lemonade ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary state sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into the country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there well you know it just I mean\nIt's basically a national emergency\nIf you look at it you have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks imbedded with the migrant caravan of North Port friday said that they had met people from ... dash\nThat are joining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating Wal Mart I follow Marla in Mexico the bridge has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to process easily\nA said Anna on Univision they profit from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday there were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nAnd you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to\nCross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly um so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback votes all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there sorting entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me\nUh I've been to the drug warehouses huge I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that are that have been done\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is gonna win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care of the Gavin Newsom as promising every Californian legal ... legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nLuck for the people of California when that disaster happens but you know you you watch this and is not one Democrat thing one thing about this because they've always supported open borders\nNow do they not know that by priests precipitating this confrontation\nThat there could be innocent people that end up getting hurt here\nI guess for them they would use that as just another reason to hate and blamed Donald Trump\nYou know or maybe they're hoping the Trump won't do anything and that was all talk no action they don't have any legitimate plane for asylum in America because you that would be the first country they go to the way they have so we can send them back immediately if we have to\nBut if you have five seven fourteen thousand people in front of our troops along the border what good is going to come out of this\nYou know if some you know while they're breaking the law they're criminals there not respecting our laws and our sovereignty\nAnd at the end of the day\nYour lead in ten fourteen thousand what's gonna happen next week and what's going to happen in the week after\nI think you know the Democrats have always believed that change in in in you know allowing illegal immigrants in the country of somehow helps them politically in the long term\nBut I don't think the American people won't open borders the American people fundamentally believe in the rule of law the American people believe in immigration but they weren't legal immigration\nAnd when they see the magnitude in just one processing and then recognize that this is happening every single day at our borders to me this is going to energize the more you want to go out and elect Republicans that will fund fully the wall\nPresidents only had three and a half billion dollars so far to build the wall he's trying to get Congress to give them twenty five billion for twenty five billion enough to fully completely secure our southern border\nThat me nobody ever gets in not at all we just want legal immigration want to make sure who you are when you come here can you take care of yourself and do you come here and share our values and do you want your piece of the American dream then fine\nSo you got a Democratic Party now that is ... ... believes in nothing as it relates to due process Kavanaugh no presumption of innocence Kavanaugh\nSupporting lawlessness mobs all over the place now they're not speaking out against the confrontation your leaders in the Democratic party encouraging the kicker we can't be sociable with people we disagree with unless we win the election\nYou know get a crowd in front to tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Maxine Waters follow them into a department store the gas stations in grocery stores and you see what's happening it happened again even this weekend\nAnd the other issue that should be on everybody's mind Fifteen days is after eight

animation fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more and if that happens what's gonna happen after that\nIt's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law and constitution and the values that have served do so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme position however you got home with his comment you got a former Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil again once we have our that's not really supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you get\nThe Caribbean merging north thousands and thousands of people um I think the president is right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid is that this is going to continue and talking about putting folks on the border putting troops on the border putting National Guard on the border to make sure there's\nNo telling what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now it's almost like we're headed towards a major human confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and the president of the saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty\nUm no I I think Democrats are like ... in the back of their heads hoping this happens all maybe something bad will happen in Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I'm not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady coming is that a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm and I'm sick of this kind of stuff\nShe gives it the right way you came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted a choice for goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happen and the and the possible politically application\nAnd and motivations behind these things\nThat's what bothers me the most and I think again\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming asylum aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have the issue of the mob doesn't know Democrat seems willing to confront and either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nOr we saw Mitch McConnell go through those are the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media\nYou know literally and then we have now Henry Kissinger was shouted downloads in some of those [noise]\n\n\nThings [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries and you know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... uh what's her name Maxine Waters you you create a crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell leads to a country you\nKnow then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil would somebody do agree with\nNo this is this is is wrong and they get this is not how not on a decent people are supposed to behave and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean it did is to send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far as I Am\nNot is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the idea you'll show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left\nThis is a New Year's Christmas is the way liberals and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and still so wrong and just\nNot going to win this great nation off or how does the president and this will be my goal a president obviously is is gonna pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing that there's this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know getting where we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that nickname with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that it's safe for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't see people the president does want to see that\nBut I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nNo I write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats won't support it because I think deep down they want the politics of this you see they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more beloved you when people get their hold them not to catch and release policy hold them\nOut there have their case is due to cater to we can find out or they legitimate\nOr they're really fleeing something are or are they coming here to do harm are they part of the game what's their background if it takes some time to do that but it takes resources it takes people\nBut if the Democrats won't allow it to pass the legislation that would put all that in place so we can get a answers quickly are much much more at a much more credit or better than we do today\nThat's the problem so quit playing politics let's solve problems and let's do it in a way that's consistent with the rule of law\nOr we'll talk more about the election Jim Jordan is with us from Ohio he'd like to be the next speaker of the house also or we'll get to that we do have some deep

disabled that's helping them in their family\nAll never let Washington bring their promises you\nI approve this message\nRight congressman Scott Perry he is up for reelection this is a really important or do you want to look at the balance of power in Congress or in sixteen days this is ed team days to election day\nOr a newly redistricted congressional district can in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sixty three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for the newly drawn district and\nVery won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nOr they decided read the draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was read redrawn it was heartbreaking\nThat's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us he's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have a I'll just read the book they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can and they drew the district and make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member\nA to win and not just the you know you kind of highlighted some of the things er during the course of the big thing they're doing which but we're not just doing it to me you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim Martin Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it and that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare\nA show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system\nAnd and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right and now they're blaming us\nFor messing it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put with thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement bill for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original build that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew you know what to talk to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the buildup we finally passed yet they're running his playbook all across the country because they don't have anything else\nThat we broke healthcare well let's all hardly ... tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support bring existing conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house on top of that the individual mandate is gone I mean it's all all Obama Care was was one huge redistribution ski where are you going to have the young and healthy literally\nBuying plans that they don't need or want to be enforced by law to have it or penalized if they don't get it financially and then literally\nRedistribute that money to the ... the elderly and disabled the redistribution skin\nAnd meanwhile they're young to get off a lot better by paying for one doctor's visit here to make sure they're healthy and buying at their age you know catastrophic insurance which you know is going to be like fifty bucks a

well\nThat's exactly right we try to repair it a bitter and then of course we repeal that voted to repeal it and replace it with a much better program\nAnd then of course it failed in the Senate but that doesn't stop them from only telling half the story which is that somehow we voted to repeal Obamacare and in doing so uh and the coverage for pre existing conditions like the only way to have coverage for preexisting conditions\nIs Obamacare which is on its face absurd but that's what they're doing everywhere now normally because people know me and the district because I grew up here like

the typical savings for a family it's five hundred dollars a month\nThinking blame the Democrats are not giving us the boats to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic as they want but you know who might mixed in with the people that maybe just one job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but she was the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary overtreatment once\nThat any country if you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your border because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border to participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get ... you know I'm I'm I'm On promoting my my uh my book get today in the last couple of days model a lotta left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\nResponse so you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws have everybody so upset John ... will cut their answer by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more bottom\nThe bottom ten percent of the society showing the wages what five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last ... Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donny\nDonny Donny called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind went to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was gay he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background is similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in our country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years have us a scenario that has not\nUnfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I started the dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular\nAt the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans\nThat can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and but you have to have the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies on because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes it never happens black markets crop up and then there was a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela was like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making get an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat\nTelling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this\nYou know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honoring distinction is that it seems like there's no limit here but there's no moderation let either ... and the Democratic party ... used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society or even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they need contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling I'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it about the you know what you know what's great about the people just want you to think about this Ninety five percent obese professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the malarkey yeah\nStay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is one of those Trump the blue collar president\nUp you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs and factory jobs are we bringing industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nAdditional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs than eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps as dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also responsible gun owners that's why we're friends with the USCC a they're giving away free gun every day twenty four days out you'll get all the official rules when you go to defend family dot com\nOr if you prefer you can pick up your cell phone right now and ... the word protect\nP R O T E C T\nThe number eight seven to two to tax the word protect\nTo eight seven to two to twenty more chances to win and remember there's not a lot of time this offer ... and and\nSince you're since I was in the middle east\nMartha McSally and I approve this message are we have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now or whether it's twenty five to the top of the hour that was put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experience is pretty unbelievable here also watching in Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border has become well they they big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back from\nPerson to them I was calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake your that blind shake involved in the ... the bombings in America\nUm she had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest developments cinema once attack be a stay at home moms for reaching off their husbands\nThese women who act like being at home we go up their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing checks of some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha McSally is with us or more of a hurry you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven when you apply to a but uh I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about ... I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nSon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and their extremism on so many issues is being on earth but the Arizona local media is protecting her a\nAnd making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are turning it into a TV ad ah the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compare to be serving twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms and our way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know why you served abroad post nine eleven\nCorrect Yes sir I was a a ten pilot I was fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet and combat\nUh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan three hundred and twenty five combat hours in a pan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was absolutely honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse and send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Columbine I nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans sense then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know troops will I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a command or are we would you know we would get\nOut there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our a ten but oftentimes ah you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as they had the flag draped casket would come through and there was ... it was a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's okay within American going to join the Taliban to fight against us\nI mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nAnd Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said that this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans parish over this\n... you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more uh both on the ground in the air and on the the I mean this is this is you know why we fight\nOr to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties and at this and as you know in addition to this a comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and\nShe also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to a flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east\nSo this isn't just a one off or her uh this is the pattern she advocated a shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot literally coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like the you know a\nA deep dive dump has been made but I I Would think that this was common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in the race to people\nAbsolutely look at you know we we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in our internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer top recruit for them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical cats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks\nRight some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independents\nOr an Republicans who are not tuning in unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played it costs us about seven hundred thousand dollars to make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now\nAnd she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to mix Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need the help or to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf the mantle of Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten too good to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you
