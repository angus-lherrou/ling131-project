New Jersey I'm sixty years old and over the past two and a half years or so I've watched by PSA bottle around and ended up going from around five and a half to around six and a half in two and a half years\nAt my urologist urging I got a four K. score test done as purporting to be a more accurate measure fraction aiding the TSA kind of like they do now with cholesterol yesterday I got the results which indicate a thirty seven percent probability that if biopsy they find a cancer with a Gleason score greater than seven\nI'm concerned that the tissue might be better off left alone than disturb can you just comment on prostate biopsies for cats are generally and distraction aided PSA test in particular thanks\nOkay well thanks for that question David and by the way you have a a really promising career ahead of you in broadcasting because you've got a really a sterling voice\nUh but so David ah predicament really illustrates what men are up against because uh the PSA test\nA is sometimes um you know can be misleading er an elevated PSA or can point to cancer but I have many men who have high pie essays who don't have cancer and the reason they have elevated the essays is because their prostate is either enlarged or or it's inflamed with chronic cross the targets\nAnd so you know you follow the pie essays and if the pie essays are trending upwards that's a concern and then you can do some other tests you can do a what's called the ah percentage free PSA that to some extent has been a supplanted with other more sophisticated tests like the four K. test\nA and then there's the uh imaging and you know you start with ultrasound and then you can go to a MRI imaging\nAnd are these tests are better ways of discerning or whether you need a biopsy no the ultimate test as a biopsy uh but that's not exactly pleasant because you get a needle although it's a very fine needle stuck into your prostate it's done under anesthesia but it can lead to complications like bleeding and pain and inflammation\nA and yes theoretically there's the risk of spreading the cancer if cancers president of but it's really the gold standard for finding out if you have areas in your prostate which are\nUm you know the malignant and then uh\nYou have the choice if you have a low grade prostate cancer especially if you're an older man of doing what's called a active holistic Surveillance Act of almost like surveillance feeds watching waiting a while you modify your lifestyle take certain supplements and as often as not\nA the status of the prostate doesn't change because not all prostate cancer is aggressive the problem is we have\nA few ways of discerning whether prostate cancer is a slow indolent condition you know it was a good amount to a high risk of dying of prostate cancer versus a very aggressive form of prostate cancer that those tests are in the works\nA but it it sounds to me you know if I were your position I don't know all the facts are that I Would urge you to get some expert or imaging a from a urologist and ultimately you know that may or may need reassurance that there's nothing there and we don't need to do a biopsy or that yeah something suspicious and we got to put in a needle in\nThe of cancers present that would be my take on your situation David so all the best he and uh yeah I feel your pain it's a subpoena guy these

medicine to grow up in here and a series of nutrition stories here\nWhat surprised you if I told you that eating a lot of junk food\nIncreases your risk of cancer well that would seem to be the does story of the months if not of the year but this was proven in a large study how large\nBorn in Seventy one thousand four Ninety five adults from a steady called the European perspective investigation to the cancer nutrition\nLasting from Nineteen Ninety two to twenty fourteen with average follow up of Fifteen Years\nAnd they looked at the relationship between diet quality and the risk of cancer and the headline here is eating foods with low nutritional quality ratings linked to cancer risk\nAnd so it would seem to me that's kind of into it if they had to be too big study to prove this or what they found was that the overall risk of cancer was seven\nPercent higher in people who ate a poor quality diet I'm kind of surprised that the small magnitude of increased risk right who think that oh it might be doubled tripled no only seven percent increased risk\nSpecifically Kansas of the coal and the rectum\nOr the stomach in the south I guess lung cancer for men and liver and post menopausal breast cancer for women were all associated with poor quality diet so they're having something that's kind of we know this one\nEating processed meats tied to breast cancer risk now you notice\nWe're not talking about meat consumption actually many people who invaded against animal protein\nOr had been disappointed by studies that show that there is not necessarily a risk associated with eating non processed meat\nOf some of the previous studies of aggregated processed meats heat of the equation when we look at meat consumption but when we separate out processed meats for me it's just not meat per se that's causing the higher risk of breast cancer it's processed meats like hotdogs bacon and ham\nWomen who ate the most processed meats hunting nine percent increased risk of breast cancer compared with those when frequently aid such\nFoods so\nThat's the breast cancer linked to meet but specifically process made and this one controversial\nRecommendation in pregnancy is

that those with the family history of psychotic disorders or more likely to develop them when they use marijuana or with marijuana and the steady use mice as\nTheir test subject I think that's funny like you know you don't you're kinda like think you know then you're which might get to smoke pot right there [laughter] and then one other groups including my\nWorst adoptable that schizophrenia and these mice after being exposed to th they were more likely to develop the shorter than those abnormal risk\nAnd always you know be honest with your doctor if you if you use marijuana even if it's illegal in your state if you're using marijuana and you're having other issues talk to your doctor about it they need to know if you're using it no one's going to like call the cops on you\nBut it's

we have some some usual like that call every week and we're going to put them in the show down because of that it's kind of fun to have like a couple of we got like a lady out to a Michigan and we got a guy out of Dallas and they play every single week in a really good at it\nAnd they were talking with Michael pitch and he's the author of owning bipolar how patients families can take control of bipolar disorder and Larry you had a good question for him\nYeah I just Michael we talked about it in the last segment where people do throw the term around loosely or just people sort of in anger will say yeah my ex was bipolar about stay away from that guy he's bipolar\nIt is very serious and how do you determine if someone's depressed or someone really is bipolar what are some of the things that you look for to be able to determine if they are\nWell there are several factors relate to look for um I always like to begin part of the conversation with somebody\nTo let them know that bipolar is mostly a genetic neurologically they used\nA disorder so it's hereditary it's passed through family lines so if somebody has a family member of parents grandparent or extended family member\nWho they know at a bipolar disorder or some serious mental illness that made it in some way seen similar to it that might put them at risk of developing that disorder as well and then from there are there specific symptoms that developed and that can develop any time of life\nBut we see it quite frequently get adolescence particularly because um\nThey ... it is their permit skew is when they become a adolescent\nWell that certainly could be a part of it but I think because of moral changes pressures that\nMost of us have gone through an adolescent son and sort of the approach of adulthood various pressures can really become catalyst for an underlying genetic type of foundation for bipolar disorder and then from there\nYou can expect mood swings that are pretty severe and more severe than we would expect people who don't have bipolar disorder so Larry when you brought up\nAbout depression um\nIt can be very much a part of bipolar of course it tends to be very deep and and a profound type of of experience for an individual but they also will very very often experienced the offset of what we called manic episodes that was marked by high excited ability\nTo when they get everything done right\nYeah there you got to be very pressured um and most people really uh experience\nOut as as a very euphoric a joyful kind of experience that they feel very creative very energetic on top of the world it can also turned very sour and very irritable\nAnd and angry at some point in that episode but that's one of the reasons why lots of people don't want to give up their bipolar disorder because they miss those\nDon't mind doing them mania yeah exactly\nAnd I'm going to ask you a question about ... genetic because you you mentioned that is genetic and\nJust for our listeners I Know we talked about this on the show before so happy genetics means you could actually have the genetic predisposition to have bipolar disorder\nBut there are certain things that may trigger it to turn on or certain things you can do that may help it to not turn on\nSo are you familiar Michael with some of the things like I mean I'll just give an example if somebody has the the genetic profile to be a bipolar but then they become a smoker and drinker and they have a sedentary lifestyle aren't they more likely to turn that on\nYes absolutely and that's a very important of feature\nTo understand when when you look at the whole profile of what bipolar disorder is and what it can do to a person's life and in in owning bipolar I Do talk about uh the two basic causes of the disorder and and talk about that as we go forward in in in the book and that is you have the predisposition\nUm which is the genetic peace and then you have catalyst but\nSometimes people called triggers and\nSubstance use is a big trigger and um then very often substance abuse in particular and bipolar are very highly uh I'm co occurring\nDisorders but other changes to like I mentioned hormonal changes are and that adolescence a Wi Fi on sets very frequently in postpartum women uh during a pregnancy and after childbirth I can be very much at risk if they have that\nGenetic foundation and they may not know it\nUntil those experiences a PR but again a lot of people in those circumstances are very much at risk\nSo you're three phase approaching you can't talk about in the book can you walk us through quickly those three phases\nYes the three phases of bipolar therapy center around the medical stabilization of those symptoms are bipolar and that is to say a medications or used to stabilize lewd\nSo the first phase is the pre stabilization phase that's before medications or tried and that's really the crisis time I'm usually um when I see patients\nAre in the pre stabilization phase or in some sort of crisis either because of bipolar directly or some way it's being exacerbated by it like relationship issues substance use like we talked about the ... and that's the time with people tend to be in denial um and and and we work through that piece of it along with\nA family member to you know if that's available because that's how many support is going to be so critical going forward and that's really focused on treating bipolar symptoms and we talked about how mania can be enjoyable\nSee you've got to break it down and the things that are not so enjoyable so that people can start to think and conceptualize test this may in fact be a problem and that you go through the introduction of medications to stabilize mood that can be very ...\nSo that's the second he might not get it right\nRight and a lot of these people I notice of bipolar they go they go to a physician who's not familiar with bipolar and they get put on antidepressants and then they get worse\nBecause they're not on the the right or they're on that they're wrong medication let me just say and it because they were on the wrong combination of manager or whatever they go they go down the wrong road but it's it's kind of a trial and error with some patients wouldn't you say\nOh absolutely trial and error in it part estate location a few people will get it right the first time so to speak but\nVery often a it's a struggle um act which actually win\nOr haven't been identified and like you said it may receive a way to cooking alone which can engaged and sometimes it is not a happy kinda maybe I can write very irritable a agitated and ultra will often by polish loved identified\nAnd they get more of the anti depression medication that can hold back and not getting\nAny better let me double it react that way and then in the real problem yeah and there are no go ahead\nIt when we get the medications correct so short a complete that have and then you can move at the third and hopefully very long cages stabilization and that's really when you treat the person the on the bipolar cells\nAnd integrate family work as well\nOne thing that ... that we found it you know executive medicine in Texas where people flying from all over the the globe to see it through the half day physical ... sometimes we find people\nThat um it it really they're doing a little bit better or somewhat better and they're seeing a therapist or psychiatrist and and then we find out that they have some micro nutrient deficiency is maybe their hormones are out of whack and\nAnd it's really looking at all of that together you know how do you get this patient to the to the optimal\nA health all the way around because it's real easy when you see somebody with a diagnosis says severe depression or bipolar or something that has to do with you know from the neck up\nAnd you think they don't need anything else and the rest of their body\nAnd I think that's a big mistake to make up a little bit silly you know I just want to thank you Michael for coming on the show I Want to give everybody a website it's bipolar network dot com it's bipolar network dot com and then on Facebook bipolar network\nAnd um they you know thanks again this is a great book owning bipolar and the subtitle here is how patients and families can take control of bipolar disorder and I do I know we have a lot of professionals that

dementia defender sure I Know how you brought up I'm bipolar and sometimes it's easy to label but do you ever feel like sometimes you can tell who's bipolar on social media\nGreat on social media yeah I think you can yeah you know social media is a lot of times people use it as a platform to complain or really get angry ...\nVictimization yeah and and or where there that you can't really tell where they're coming from because some of the postal be uplifting some will be really morose yeah so I better all over the place would be what a great question for the doctors if if he rolls through social media\nI think innately we store to know some of the people in our lives we suspect right or for sure\nYeah I I agree but I think there should be a study that I'm gonna call I'm going to call us Dr ... ... and I'm going to tell us when you didn't do a study it would\nBe interesting if it was kept you know obviously very very secretive where they could take the patience to look at their social

I mean I told myself I was like look you know you've got to have already several sources of income coming in to supplement the one you're about to lose and that's what our prayers ship in multiple different avenues of income that essentially if one business fails you can still pay the bills and the other three that you got going on\nBut I developed a plan I looked at it from a common sense approach and I did not\nAssume anything I did not assume that would be hired on the spot and me it's like you know what I'm going to plan for the waste worst case scenario um get a plan like I'm not going to have a job with the first six months\nSo I save every penny man I had at least ten thousand dollars in like they've saved up or even got out I use my Ga on getting my degree I was going to go back to college but then I launched the business and then I delved into a new realm of social media it's like the next ... space in a weird\nWay without aliens and the ... the Balkans and stuff like that it's actually just trolls and bought stuff like that anyway but it was a whole new world man it was I I'm like I'm like the Latin and your Jasmine\nAnd I'm sitting there saying like oh and we're on the carpet or paying for ads and we're close to the the ... it's crazy stuff so I went down that avenue I've been\nDoing it ever since then it's just it's it's um\nI'm not even gonna sit here and lie to you and tell you I have a plan\nIt's one of the things that I've just found this journey and see where it goes man I'm just doing multiple different things multiple different businesses multiple different endeavors and applying myself in every way that I can hopefully make something successful and then I'll just standing at some times you know things just aren't going to go right things won't be successful you just got to walk away and let die\nBut those who don't know ... he's got\nWhat six hundred and thirty two thousand four hundred and Ninety five hours on Facebook alone give or take him out [laughter] he was featured on American great with John ... has it been odd being someone who went from being an army drill sergeant and and doing everything that you didn't the army to being on TV and having\nOver half a million people on Facebook alone checking out your each and every move\n[noise] middle is weird at times ah yeah I'm not gonna lie there are times like when they think that the guy from the ... and the guy TV is who I Am in real life like that was that was the trainer role I had to be you know that I wasn't the protesting that would be being the drill sergeant get\nBut no one is like that twenty four seven if they are well then I feel sorry for you that's not what about a light that's got to be very happy like just you know going home at night hanging upside down and December when you're forty five ... nobody thought\nOh no I don't know but for me it it's just a like the thing that I've been blessed to do is being able to show the entire world or the international stage my transition of leaving the military and they're doing what I Am doing now and it's been it's been difficult times there are times that I'm a\nI don't feel motivated I don't feel like I Want to share a part of my life but that's what social media has turned into that with people you know the measures that gets\nYou if you looked at my message box it's insane there's you know your negative messages and then a positive message to and you get guys in there like I I I had a guy like three nights ago a navy veteran suicide a survivor\nTalked about you know watching the gaming stop watching this stuff that we do has been somewhat tackle that have given him something to look forward to and\nThat right there is what makes it all work but that's what makes the drive worth you know because there are times that like I just want to give it up as a you know the stupid you know but then you get that message of empowerment and it's like damn that's that's amazing that's incredible\nAnd it just it feels you want to do more goodness because to be perfectly open met up these last three years two years ... there's been a lot of anger a lot of anger inside of me and I didn't know where to cure towards\nAnd I didn't know what the cause of it was it was just anger of having been through four and a half years of Iraq and Afghanistan from solution to the ... river valleys and stuff like that but the worst fighting out there and there's just a lot of internalized anger and I could figure out why and maybe it's because\nYou come back to America as you see it and the state of affairs that it is and now it's like this is not what we fought for we fought for America be America be United in a sense but we're not\nWhich you know and if that is the Democratic process democracy you know we don't we don't have\nWe we are able to disagree and stuff but\nOver the last two years it's been trying to find that anger and channel in a positive direction\nAnd kind of go through this transition on the stage and let other people see into my life that people that are following me for years now it's only that you know I remember when you were pursuing this number when you were doing this to see where you are now and it's nice to see you're actually blindly tried to come up through that that whole in the ground and\nUnderstand that life is worth living and it's worth living happy don't be open to all at the end consumer you inside it for the longest time\nIt's just very easy to like that that that the inner demon control your mind how you look at then had to talk to people I Do various things now I still\nGet on YouTube and do my my funny comedic thing sometimes those are the drill sorts of something to do the comedic thing it's all about playing around it will work but the biggest device I could give anyone transitioning out of the military man it's fine something's going to make you happy keep your hands busy\nOh typically time man I'm I've got about Fifteen people\nI'm coming from out of state they're crashing in my house I Know a lot more people coming to it's just we're we're having a made up man it's a meet up to go do this Comic Con together\nOr to go to work out together it's a lot of fun you know we'll probably have some drinks play some games just hanging out be a good cool community and it's not like I said it's not just for veterans it's for everyone and uh we have Christie Swanson the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer she's going to be there she's a friend she wants to get involved somehow she loves helping its for veterans\nUm it it's just been it's growing it's a growing community it's been insane to see the amount of river almost at ten thousand numbers on Facebook\nI'm and I'm just trying to get my falling on Facebook cushion of that group to contribute to help out to have some fun but the meat up it's literally a we've only had one meet up in Dallas like maybe about seven months ago about twenty people show up and we literally met for breakfast what does the con we all kind of hung out a few people crashed my place next they woke up again\nAnd we just we have a lot of fun it's like\nPeople getting to be kids again man people getting to be kids dark out over the comic books meet their favorite characters and we'll get to meet data from Star Trek enjoyable forwards from Star Trek it was so much fun man it's a\nIt's just it gives some it gives people some purpose it gives them something to look forward to and maybe sometimes that's really all someone needs to keep them alive is to give them something to look forward to\nHas there been any surprise for people who know John Burns more from the outrageous humor and the uh the loud fat shaming videos from here there are people surprise that hey maybe he's actually a nice guy tried to do nice things for people to\nOh yeah yeah well you know a lot of it is people don't understand the delivery is the key ingredient to

uh America is also\nUh\nNow with CBS I on veterans powered by connecting vets dot com I navy vet Eric day back to our conversation with saving our world renowned sculptor who was chosen to go the monument to the men and women who served in world\nWar one in our nation's capital [noise]\nWhat's it surprising to you when you first learned that there was no World War one memorial a true World War memorial in our nation's capital considering the importance of that period of time\nYes yes and no it was surprising that such a war that was so large and change the world is such a dramatic level that was that was\nThat was odd to me that the thing is I'm I'm bi cultural so I grew up in Europe\nSo I Would have expected something like that but uh America is also a very modern and\nForward thinking country so I think one of the reasons that it was not in place was because we don't look at history and the same way as Europeans do and I think that's something that's something that's actually changing now is our our country and the rest of the world becomes more global an inter digitized um\nI I don't think that it's something that you can bypass and I think it was bypassed by other events in the United states such as the great depression and so\nIf you if you do\nLook at history World War one is where\nYou move into maternity where the United states changes the way that a human being solved themselves into you know how they relate to\nThe greater universe or ... or where they alone and World War one did something that really began my maternity and it's this um the beginning of where man sees himself more alone I mean you have to think twenty two million people died in this global\nEthics war it's ... it's a comprehensible those numbers today\nIt certainly is a the birth of modern warfare but modern warfare as a has changed quite a bit since World War one I really just when you go back and learn about it read about it look at a pieces of art about it a a terrifying horrifying time for anyone who was involved in World War one of\nCourse the lack of a memorial there and say were you surprised of course you've still got to be surprised because it's not in place yes so same and I wanted to ask you where does that still now at what point in the process are we in how close are we seeing your sculpture in purchasing park\nIn some communities where people live with the members of those communities and drawing on the veterans as well to help create that bridge\nWhere some of the specialties are blue star families as far as the programs and services that you're able to provide to males or\nYeah the way they go about doing is we we listen to the problems we I'm a ... ... ... finding out what's going on today what are the biggest challenges today we make\nSolutions through partnerships I'm with corporations with a government with other non profits and we drive those solutions in the community we signed to our\nNational survey which gets released in Congress every year which I reached the texture of the fence on we find out that the big issues facing military families today are economic insecurity and social isolation\nAnd so we address those who are chapters which are in thirty two um states and for um overseas countries and then we have really robust programs in a spouse employment and also in areas that brings people together we work with folks like Disney like Facebook\nA like a a Microsoft to create programs that really\nConnect people within their communities\nWhat do we need to do to helping military families Dr after they leave the military or while they're gr reserve\nYeah you know one thing is we find we need to help them while they're currently serving because you know you\nYou probably know from your own service today's military don't live on base anymore eighty percent are off base there in communities and fewer and fewer are able to access um installation resources weren't because they're um you know millennials they don't necessarily want to\nShow their community Seventy five percent of them have been better less than two years\nMost of them are experiencing really high levels of separation almost half of our families who had over six months of separation last year and a half so this is making life really tough for families think part of one of our chapters joining one of our chapters so you can connect to the military folks in your community especially\nFor your listeners who are veterans who can really understand their lives and and be a support for them that's a really meaningful thing so we find that our chapters are\nExcellent support for folks another thing that we find is that spouse employment is really crippling today's military 'cause today's families need two incomes a military salary is just not enough to provide the American dream for a household without support and although most of our spouses are educating credential we have\nIncredibly high unemployment and under employment rights more than twenty percent unemployment when the overall society is three point nine percent to boost our family has a really robust programs to not only um identify the spouses and employers but to actually play spoke into employment that works for them\nAnd why do you think it is important that those of us who have a better understanding of that reach back to help go we're going to be in our situation in the coming years that are currently serving on our duty now\nYeah you know the the veterans today can really extend their mission to to the country by by helping to be that\nUnderstanding support to the people who are currently serving because without her you know one percent of people serving it's very easy to feel isolated in your community it's easy to feel like the people around you don't understand and I'm with the families being so uh just connected right now we're finding that the number one reason that otherwise promote double service people\nLeave service just because they're concerned about their family's well being\nUm they leave because their spouses have careers\nAnd they don't want to disrupt them or because their kids have just gone to too many schools my daughter when she was tenth grade was starting to attend school but we also see at the same time that a\nMilitary people loved the mission and if they can feel their families are okay\nThen they can keep doing it so when we look at our surveys and we say do you feel connected in your community more than half say no we don't\nWe ask them have you spoken to someone who's not currently connected to the military and the last month thirty percent say they haven't even had that conversation and those people who are disconnected are the ones who are doing the least well so by\nBeing that veteran who is that you know that bridge to the civilian community you can say hey not only do I understand you but I'm also a part of the largest decided to support you and we we can help you get through this\nOf course you don't need to be a veteran voted support military families or even veterans and we've and there's actually a new program as I understand it through blue star families called the neighbors program can be told me a little bit about that what you were to accomplish group of liberal route\nYeah we're so excited about the blue star neighbors program cause for us it really is\nThe solution to the problem most people solve problems with people they know right and when the military becomes a cul de sac when we just know each other that we don't have access to all the ideas are connections when you retire and if you want to start a business you don't have necessarily access to the\nYou know sort of investment income or some of the other ideas so if we can connect the neighbors who have this feeling of goodwill towards the military but they don't know what to do if we can make it easy and fun for them to connect to them that currently serving in transitioning military and their community then not only do we have the military but we really help\nThe neighbor to what we find for the people who participate with us as blue star neighbors is that they feel they get much more out of the program they give just from\nGetting to be part of the mission of serving the country that they feel they're part of one day connect through our community so that's the boost our neighbor program and it's on our website anyone veteran or non veteran can participate in it\nSounds like something that we need more of you know building these bridges of understanding between the military veteran communities and the civilian community is that a big part of what blue star families in particular we was neighbors program of about kind of\nNormalizing military families and ordering people realize they were just like you and I just happened to do with why we're different job than we do\nThat is exactly right you know it it it is normalizing and I love that word it's saying this is this is a normal part of our country and we need to be connected into it um both for their sake and for our sake so that we understand that this is what we do as a country is\nYou know the missions that we send folks on not only will it help our community and not only will help the\nIndividual families who are doing better but it'll help the country as a whole because we'll make people smarter about this work that we do that after all civilians need to control the military and they can't control something they don't know or understand\nYou you mentioned your a chapter based organization if people are hearing this and they're interested in it and their their families\nI Want to find one of these blue star families chapter where do they go to find out that information and find the closest one to the\n... come to our website blister Pham that or or just do a little blue star families and you can see on our website where all of our chapters are we're always creating new ones we have a wonderful help from a terrific sponsors such as a\nBoeing and Macy's and when you were a project you are helping us built those chapters we also have what we call a virtual chapter where you could interact with people across the country so we have\nA mentorship platform or you can venture military spouses are transitioning veterans who are trying to find jobs taking them once a week or once a month that some people with that connection share your insights and other\nTerrific opportunities to um participate wherever you are and whether there's a chapter on\nExactly who should be reaching out to their local blue star families after\nWhat we have anything you have to give it a military family who can receive it we have a wonderful program where we have celebrity kept cooking with military chefs at one of our neighbor celebration show if you're a great cook\nSaying it is one thing actually doing it is another in your talk with a Jesse Colvin I mean did did he come up is believable to you that he will in fact be able to work with those people across the aisle\nYeah I mean aside from the pledges that they make as you know with honor kinda demands um aside from their shared experiences that they've had with their fellow veterans I think their ability to explain\nWhat's really going on to their voters is what separates them and I think that that is going to yield I think a little bit more transparency and a little more cooperation because they've all been there done that\nIdeological or my way or the highway type leaders in Iraq and Afghanistan they got people killed they got fired or both or why one of the reasons I think there are so many veterans running as we volunteer to Iraq and Afghanistan\nWith no exit strategy their own and many of us lost friends and colleagues many of us are lost friends and colleagues since we got home things like post traumatic stress but you come home and it hit of Congress' full of\nCareer politician who not only okay with it for a a ... hour cable news but they actually want that status quo because they benefit from that status quo\nSo there's there's a I'm I'm really excited they are young wave a veteran candidate who wants to ... country over partly because I think we need a new generation of leadership\nThere are different styles of leadership as he pointed out some of them work in certain situations don't work in other situations\nWhat do you think the veterans are bringing in general not just with a Jesse but with everybody that's running for office a man there are quite a few of them and you can go with honor to check out the Republican and democratic candidates that they're supporting of course they just got a huge ten million dollar influx of cash from Amazon's Jeff Bezos the founder of\nOf that company what do you think it is a you know based on what you've read what you've heard what Jessie told you what do you think it is the ties these veterans together and makes them kind of custom made for this is what he said that ability to have been there and done that or is or even more too I think\nMy biggest takeaway hearing how he's going to approach this and how all the veterans that are running for office are going to approach their freshman\nYear is the thing they didn't say and you didn't hear them say the word Democrat or Republican as much as you hear these incumbents\nTalk about it it's almost straight out of their mouth right away when they refer to somebody and all that Democrat so and so is that Republicans so and so\nThis guy Jesse Colvin kept referring to his fellow veteran candidate he also used on line we're not going to be afraid to speak truth to power they're not going to be afraid to get up there and talk to each other rather than speak to the power elite that run the parties\nAnd it's on that note that will end to this week's edition of CBS eye on veterans powered by connecting that's dot com\nThanks for joining us and

I Love will if we need a trademark that that's great\nI Know right I should have went over there and check out the domain hurry up get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right off of it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to me he got the old TV background and the passion to know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it all together so when I\nYou know found you I was like oh my gosh she's like you like me this is great so now how have you been able to go all across the planet I mean you've been everywhere this and this is this is good\nWell there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there is a novel and money and very dry bankrolled by some sort of X. files department but I'm not simply you know I I\nWork for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry basically buffalo [noise] um and for them I'm a ... of uh magazines could require new things like that but I'm even aside from that I just love mysteries\nUm and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to Glen towards an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a critical thinking folklore point of view and so one such party the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere you\nLie for them if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all friends\nLook in the goats again All right you know\nIt's like they're like we're gonna we're going to go to the beach and like that's really cool I suppose the monster affair so yes wandering over they're interviewing\nPeople taking photos and so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere or you know I I haven't either anyway so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean\nIt just kids what it is you just can't help but it's it's in your mind me that's what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be just dying to\nLose weight Iran [laughter] I can relax a little bit the despite you know just by one of my friends will tell you I can relax biking trail\nBut you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago and I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking ice birds and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are they wash up there but I also wanted to go investigate some of that\nAnd the local Spring Hill jak fighting up there but I thought it was up there I came across um a place called lake crush and um and it's this little you know ... it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have\nA like a twenty foot\nA metal sculptor thing for the same as you enter the town and the counting of the population like three or four or something\n[laughter] I rented a car I'm like I put on the break but I got to the I I Can't pass a lake monitor come on by and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\nWell it's better than stopping for the biggest you know world begets a ball of yarn or something like that great that's all right I'm with you [laughter]\nThat's great stuff okay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I I Google that ... them found your article that you've written 'cause you you do a lot of writing you're an author of course\nBut you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine\nAnd um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article for Neal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and so it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody his was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're already we're just now learning the Oregon will it's wean the galaxy origins of Halloween\nSee this or that I I I Want two hundred years from now when people are

about\nAbout you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the on the holidays mean your Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists because all the the the conservative sometimes get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the ... which is not but it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nHey it's Chris Rock and Shannon from the under

with Ben Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panic in gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great ... and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just the regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year do you know I don't\nSee any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mass can we make make something out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do it you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused\nOn kids until about Nineteen fifty before that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids' kid centered as it is today\nA it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to win and the the the hurry a Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the the\nChanging of the season and darkness and snow and all that\nUm but you know so you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know look obviously the next day which was to honor that the church a church members will lead to have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the folding purgatory and so there was this there was it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nHum a ritual which died out long before you know that the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things in a whole day\nAnd and again they were bringing a bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away or demons and scary things could loud noise we're such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that's where it transforms little later on into the modern costumes because what\nWould happen is\nUm uh you know 'cause we were talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins\nI'm there and sometimes the animal heads like gamblers and whatnot during the ceremonies and they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen leap from hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food\nUm to the poor during Halloween the praying for the dead\nAnd this again the ties back into all full day because the idea was that um that on that they are the ... the word purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthier members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... they were subcontracted prayers if you will\nBand that's coming together to make a kids' costumes\nUm and what you find is that uh the the first um the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks are really emerging about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't a course you know as as foreign aid in your plastic molded and stuff but what happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing is turned Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse um and this is when you started getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the the sexy police officer\nCostumes or the drag yes\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that are really creative and not just you know there's something with a mask slapped on it and\nYeah it's fine for sure I'm Still you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well like a an essay question you know I think that um you know the\nThe Halloween as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and your ... with each generation with each you know a couple of generations he changed his bed\nI'm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far or in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed\nHum ... who does like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid up just eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years\nOr you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... bill will be sort of you know virtual\nA ghost you know where you got like holographic do you get to that you got to six years later this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what it's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask him about that the panic part of it when we come back stay with it you are listening to cook because I Am I'm tiny will

you know and the Frankenstein and the Dracula kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like 'em but then there's this deep dark notes and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nYeah I mean one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know from\nCreep in some you know mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab their crops somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always going to some of that but but you know that's your for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with\nWith with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient uh because I mean they they they they didn't worship anything resembling the Christian devil at all I mean they\n... if you if you if during summer when if you ask them you know when you if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the fans paid hear what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of their world view\nUm and uh and again you know as the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a seed and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is twenty two Eighteen\nYou know shock not suffer which to live\nOn and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned\nRightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is why a ... and this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up every every year so it is in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a weed you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using a what'd you board will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners\nWere so so concerned but using a word you board was going to open up you know didn't want to ... or whatever I I I agree with that one but it I'm not saying what was interesting was that was that it was it was codified on a wall\nAnd it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rules you know sign this don't use it and so you\nKnow typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a body for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat's when because it was centered on kids that it's worth the concern came from and so it was ... that a kid the dresses up as a witch or goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party\nSo that they the the the they make a case to distinguish it from Holly and this is our way into the harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know the parents were concerned about that bill have the kids dressing up as princesses or something and said anything that might be you know darker\nScary\nIt's really interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid levine at that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights in the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local\nRadio stations at W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house in it was it was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and\nEverybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all it's one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down\nThe marathon bars mine either right away I buy them down those\n[laughter] each freeze those have you ever had um frozen\nThey were great oh under your just taken the backyard love is\nSomebody needs to a grad that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written or something\nYeah and the ... on the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here that that and uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face it last year six McGregor so I I learned that night like if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go is gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nEver on all the producers were were watching that and say hey you guys are going on the air now are still well\nKnowing the origin of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the Titanic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't pass the trick or treating stage there pass doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into\nYou know the um um\nHouses down the street that nobody's ... the abandoned homes or the ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the ... the board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different\nDevices to call upon spirits and goes now you have you have written quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I despise writing that's why I like to talk [laughter]\nThat much of a social life I'll just say that all all admit that\nIf I Do like your but your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences of now I ... I found it interesting that you had said to me\nOr that people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask you to talk to spirit where years back people would go why why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know it's true like oh no no\nNo that was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those it's basically a survey of\nOf the scientific attempts to to contact the dead of ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the er the Victorian era upper upper today's\nYou know goes hunters and all that and what you find is that the\nThe idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the which of end or in the Bible and Shakespeare you know you have lead to Macbeth banquet so there's\nThere's there's there there's no shortage of go in in literature in history but you know typically go to war\nOr if it's typically if people wanted to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to 'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently\nUm and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house where the Somerville plantation or are you there Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us a fire and you don't know me but tell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena um and it's it's faster you you you go back to look at the the\nThe ... that were held in in the Victorian era and often upper class\nUh places and they would have you know a lady's day and they were Crumpet the tea and and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then you had the the spiritual era um and you had people like Harry Houdini printed research that Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is that you know came to the states and\nKate Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so and then you're Harry uprising has researching all that and then use or a fast forward to\nCoast to coast am now here's your guest host ...\n\nCranberries and zombies on the coast to coast am county will appear on wheel of saline

of us call it a U.S oh underground or underwater emerged object right um but they would describe it as\nCandles in the water because light to them was with candles right so uh you describe it as how you know things and I'm\nNot correct the what using the terminology and the ... right out of the time\nThat they had at the time and when I got to say you know when I looked at some of the stuff that you have the videos of the light so I've never seen lights like that okay you know I I saw the light from the sky and ... and things that you've seen but you had like ... it almost was like an orange

old system you were moving a vacuum pod it would change of of a vacuum source and I\nBelieve mine is a cable like 'cause you know there's no vacuum noise I've asked other cars\nExactly exactly so you need to find a different heater control and that can be a challenge because your car's getting old enough [noise]\nKnow that it's it's may not even be available new anymore and that's where one of our partners come into play a car crash part they would have probably\nI could help me out I greatly appreciate it\nWe have had a a friend of ours that we buy palettes from and he had a continuing issues with a a ram and that same era with the air conditioning and\nI'm not the one that manages a shop like rush those when he's here but I Know that in that particular instance they\nDid some battle with the fact that some of the control for that air conditioning system in that vehicle runs back through the power train control module through the engine computer\nAnd so it is it is possible now having said this this is a possibility that with something being shortage in the ... in the clutch or something like that that it could be turning on and and uh causing a drain on the on the battery because of that short in the air conditioning compressor\nSo the first thing a person is going to do is give it a physical analysis to see All right\nDo we have refrigerated the system let's just start with the low hanging fruit as the system charged up is the clutch free or or is the clutch itself you know seized up are locked up words it's constantly engaged\nAnd then you have to start working your way way back to the electrical system but I Know that was a a challenge for them on that one and so many of the trucks that go down the road\nPulling things or work trucks the the cooling system in the front gets just compromise considerably and if it needs to be considered every time we're going to work on the air conditioning system to make sure I'm covered a lot of bases here to make sure that you always have\nAs good of air flow as possible through the front of that vehicle\nBecause that air through the air flow that comes through the air conditioning condense or is what takes that extremely\nHigh temperature compress liquid and brings the temperature back down again to bring it through the process and so you know after it's been through the compressor had there's a lot of heat generated and you need to bring that cooling back down again so\nUh bent over fins we're we're a good chunk of the front of that thing is is is restricted from air bugs or you know huge amounts to ... if you've been in a really dirty climate these are all things that have to be considered\nAs you inspect that system so if it is electrical and you get to work because of the the inspection process and the you know maybe you have to replace the cultural compressor whatever might happen to be\nFind out what caused the stress on the system to make it\nAs well or just about two weeks I thought to heal up or do something different but no it's just been they in the same\nAnd I got to start with the the the first steps a check to the break fluid levels at all where it's supposed to be\nYup there's no lakes or anything around\nBut that's always the first step when you're having what feels like a hydraulic or mechanical issue on your breaks I mean even with the analog breaks even with the the newest the systems he's still got to make sure that level to make sure something hasn't happened where you've\nHad a fluid law so having that set aside um I'm trying to think on that one time that you\nScott there is that have\nThe the hydraulic braking system on it or is it a vacuum assist you happen to know\nThough it's a vacuum a shift okay it's got a vacuum can or\nIt's got a vacuum break booster up on the fire wall that Europe is that that's going to give you that vacuum insist that makes the pedal not seem so hard this\nAs ... as the vacuum come into it through the holes that are hook up and for that yeah there's plenty of vacuum there that should work\nWhen you step on the brakes and bottoms out where we're stopping the vehicle you ever get nervous that it's not going to stop the vehicle\nWell yes just about because there is just a little bit down there but uh boy you're just ... for a foot to the floor\nBut uh what do I ... I don't want to stop\nAll right well my my first my first instinct is that you may have a master's filling they're starting to fail that is not\nWhat you're describing typically an indication of a problem with like you know people getting deeper with some of the calls we get where they're having pesky intermittent problems or breaks that are fading away and different things that we've gotten into some of these newer systems with the analog breaks you got to be concerned about but this sounds to me like a more traditional\nHydraulic bypass where it's worst bypassing that hydraulic pressure\nIn the in the master sooner itself possibly you got you know California on the front wheels and I think that oh three you've got you should've by now have ... on the back we'll also not drum breaks you can see everything so you know I haven't lost fluids even suspected the lines you are not see anything wrong there if you've got plenty of material\nOn your pads because that will happen to sometimes when the ... the brakes gets so worn down you can you can get some\nPretty unusual pedal feel it but they've got to be pretty well worn down for that and I'm going to assume just by how reasonable you talk about your problem that you've you've probably inspected that also so my my first one which would be that you've got a\nFailure going on are starting to come out with your break master cylinder which is kind of an old school problem and it's by passing up\nBy ... on a real hard you know I can stand on the pedal it doesn't go down after that you know like it's slipping by either cups or something\nYeah so you're you're that makes you wonder about whether that's what it is [noise]\nWell we are we on hooked by anti\nLock brakes just on plug 'em all that make a difference\nWhy do when we were out at the I talk about the few times but we go out to the driving school we've done a couple of times they disconnect or power down the breaks it seems that some of their cars just to show what it's like to do an emergency braking situation without intellect breaks and a ... yes the hydraulic should work just the same\nOr a minus the assist of that feature so he pulled the fuse on that it'd be a good way to you could eliminate that from the system but I I really don't think that's where your problems going to be at I think you're still going to find that problem is somewhere in your\nBreak booster masters cylinder area um you know you could even have a a a booster that is by passing on the inside where on quick hammer it's able to hold but then once you get to a certain point it just it's bleeding by the vacuum inside the you know the big diaphragm inside that booster that could also be it\nUm and so I I still think you're probably going to be at the head of the unit\nUp near the the ... where everything starts not downstream I ... I really do Gary thanks very much for the call good luck and\nMaybe stop driving it till you're ... I mean they're well and he says he's getting to the end of the pedal yeah I I forgot to ask him but he does he have a red warning light on a cause for other listeners out there\nYou're yellow lights are telling you have a ... especially in the newer cars with the modern braking systems with analog brakes traction control and dynamics has mentioned control all these different things a yellow light can be an indication of a system trouble\nThat something is out of parameters we can't read us a we'll censor you know it's it's it's a code but a red light still indicates potential hydraulic failure okay or emergency break is on you know something that is immediate so when you see a red brake light ever\nTake heat or don't think you can drive another\nHour or to the services that are having check it out if you see a red light you should you should find out what's going on 'cause you may be losing hydraulic pressure and you may not be able to stop so that's always something to be concerned about\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Steve Steve you're on the end of ... what can we do for you\nI'm calling about my six set out a few years back a uh a poor motor have a heater went out I didn't work on on any level audit replace it with an after market\nUh but now it works on uh the first three levels but not for him a little apprehensive of replacing the poor motor not faking it may be in the square what's your ours\nWell most of the systems have a a control of some sort between the switch and the motor and what will always tell people if you've had a motor failure\nIt's always good to look at an apparent you didn't have this problem I I should back up the the the blower motor control oftentimes get burned out when a motor goes bad because it builds up resistance from the circuit it builds up heating circuit and\nIt'll feed back to the to the next device which is usually this this control what a lot of times they'll amount\nIn the heater box or on the X it's on the exterior but it's in there for for air to blow through it and keep it cool and and the old cars they used to be kind of like a thermostat spring coil that would hang down in there the resistor and it kind of an old school thing that you see and then they've gotten\nMore advanced with the technology now it's a solid state device that will sit in a similar area a lot of times it's melted under the under the dashing ... on the heater boxer near the hitter box but\nIf you can follow that wiring back\nFrom the blower motor you typically find this this next piece and my hunch is that you may have weakened that when you're blower motor went out the first time and it may have just decided to to give up and that may not be giving you your full range of control because you need a full twelve vote to run that isn't the high speed you don't have direct\nWhich is kind of weird a lot of times they fail out where they they failed and it's worked out and stay on Heidi and not the ...\nCountry we've we've put ourselves in such a hurry all the time we got to be here I got to be there I've I've got to make it here a little pause and think about it and you're stuck in your vehicle and you're here in the middle of an intersection that's growing with water coming up real fast\nYou didn't you don't have time to be stuck there either or and and plus the the dollars of damage that can be done can be budget changing in a hurry because a few sucking water into an engine in it and it comes in fast enough and enough of it what happens inside there is the\nIs the pistons are moving up and down and that water comes they create the hydro lock and that hydro lock is either going to bend down or break a connecting rod or a valve 'em and these are all deep internal problems in the engine that are in most cases\nThey're repair all that you're going to replace the new ... right and I I haven't\nI haven't talked to any insurance can be yet\nThat have it but I I wouldn't be surprised at some point\nIf an insurance company were to come back to people and saying their policy that if you chose to drive into a flooded road mhm we may not cover you I'm not saying they've ever done that but I Would not be surprised at some point if that came up\nYou know it's something they would say if you're driving on a perfectly good road and chose to drive into a flooded intersection and killed your car\nWhether they knew you wouldn't want to offer like an extra protection either because you wouldn't want to encourage encourage it so I'm just I really want people to be wise about it\nThen we get into the subject of okay we've got this flooded car what what happens with it or\nThe vehicle\nHas just had bad happened where it sucks the water in killed the

waterproof and water you get what yeah yeah it it knows it's going to drive down the road and have rainwater snow slush all these things coming up against it\nBut once that level of rainwater\nOr floodwater caused by rainwater or push can search for the old right or whatever might happen to be a gets high enough where it is starting to intrude into the passenger compartment\nThat's when you start getting more nervous about that car in what's going to happen with it and so people talk about what you know fixing flood cars new sort of things I've been around a lot of that too and\nMy advice is typically\nA salt water\nIf it's if you're on the coasts listening to us and you've got the the truth the salt water coming from the ocean it gets up inside the vehicle\nMove on insurance can be there to begin to move on mhm I I Would not\nI Would fix I've just seen the the only the ugliness for mess with even if you get a really good deal it it's probably not worth it because that salt water just is so corrosive I mean if you did take the car part in in in and threw away whatever wiring harnesses the salt water got into it put new ones in\nYeah the the body of the cars going to be fine but it's any of the electronics or any of the wiring any of the systems or any of the unprotected metal for that matter up under the dash under the seats are just be very very cautious with the stuff that salt water has gotten into freshwater\nLot of that if you clean it will take things apart well drive them out well and follow a good process it can be done but it's not a quick fix it's still a time consuming tedious process that has to be followed all the way down where the water wasn't before you're going to have a proper repair on that'd be\nThat'll do it for another hour of the

T. one version they call it again that seem to fourteen a newer Silverado versus the older Ellis version that they had in there\nThey engineer it and it systems with the highest grade petroleum products that are available also\nAnd so they went to a a a higher court system they wanted more capacity and they went to that zero twenty oil so they can have you know the immediate flow that they needed and and plus the synthetic for the long range protection with that ... that they use\nThe earlier truck the oh wait I got the hunch that he was saying that he had an oil consumption issue which was it unusual because some of those would have problems with the with the uh displacement of demand system that\nThe none firing cylinders and the ... we're not getting lubricate it properly and it would cause\nWhere prematurely and they would start burning some oil in certain cylinders and there was a fix that they put out there eventually to swing that oil a little bit differently\nBut not all of them made it that far [laughter] so I was a little confused about the about the subject on that who the heartland call but he's exactly right they are allowing you to get more range because they're going to hire capacity systems and of course their engineering that newer engine with a highly engineered oil\nThat is what you have to using that engine though so I don't think he was asking about using a different oil but definitely use the recommended oil that has the the the qualifications of what that factory said you're supposed to happen that's what they engineered that engine with\nI Want to come back to the automated die in a minute let's talk to Patrick in Oregon Patrick you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nA question about my court called Honda Odyssey and unqualified whether I have a warm front desk on my breaks or that I have a bad tire and how do I ... the two\nTypically if it's a break disc that's worked\nYour only get typically only get a feel that on a a light normal breaking situation where you're just\nSlightly riding the break you'll get you'll you'll feel that pole station under late breaking because you're rolling to the ... the last few yeah you you just kind of can feel it then that's when a a a desk workers typically going to show up if they are bad enough I've seen them affect the vehicle as his running down the road for sure but they've got to be pretty bad\nA tire out of alignment will be something that you can have happened at a certain speed or certain road driving situation regardless of your of your break pressure or any of that attire situation can also be changed by rotating the tires and moving the problem around\nIs is a nice way to do it rotating tires is it or wait as easy as it used to be because you have to most vehicles you have to re sequence the tire pressure monitoring monitoring systems\nSome vehicles have a way if you read the owners made all that you can do it by yourself on board some vehicle do require you to to have someone with a tool that can recalibrate the tired the correct position of the vehicle but to\nIf you've already been ignoring your tire pressure sensitive center it's no big deal not as soon as I was in fourteen an oddity I'm going to guess he's concerned about ... to get it right\nBut does that help that is that I Will go ahead bill or two is that I have all\nThe steering is great I I it on brand new ... feel just a slight it's kind of hope on bump up as soon as I hit the brakes they won't actually ... the the direction that the game will shake them violently\nThat that makes me think you've got you've got work front brake rotors they got overheated and and uh the the material on it was a lot sooner than it used to be if a if you had one heavy breaking situation or one time where the brakes really hot and then they might have got wet super quick that can can cause that it's not\nIt's not normal you don't have to go round dodging water put right but it can't happen if they if they're really warm and then they get cool down quick\nOr that can happen but what you're describing I Would I Would lean towards the front brake rotors\nSure All right so one other question I have going on a different yeah all\nI have a friend of mine who has a couple of sheep dogs that don't like to get warm for what she gets out of the car she likes to leave it running but her\nNew or let's say six pull out that shuts off after I think ten or ... or ... that is there a remote start option is there a you know we reprogramming option that would show that on that day at a\n... I'm thinking about this the the easiest solution would be to teach the dogs out to dry right that's always the easiest to be a lot better\nYeah if the dogs would just know how to drive we'd have the song or maybe they could learn how to start the car back up right where the shorter than the dog I don't know how to do that what I'm trying to think on that car if you had if you had another\nAnother key fob or could you just on some cars that they won't let you lock the vehicle while the ... in it but could you could you leave the father in the car and and just simply you know leave it running like idling describe\nThis and I tried to tried using the remote start out there just aren't\nLeader when he was a key national it's actually able to mechanically lock the door walks away ten minutes later the cars ... sets off kind of a initial feeling banquet shut that fell off after idling or someone in that ...\nWell a lot of that they do to for safety if people would have to do that by accident in their garage right like that they'll have a a shut off on it\nBut you know on a super I'd have to think about that for a bit I'm not I can't give you a I Can't give you a direct answer maybe there's another who the out there listening that had the situation\nOr maybe you might consider installing a custom remote start ... that would give a little more functionality 'cause I Know like on some of the factory Mozart's in numerous vehicles they have a timer on them that only allows them to go\nFifteen minutes for twelve edits or whatever might have to be and the remote start you can program to run for a half hour you know\nWell and on some ... you can program them to run for a certain amount of time every certain inter mandolin it out of every half hour hour\nCrashed we should be holding off on that in order to just minor it's not it's very hard to hear what it's like [noise]\nI remember the great question mommy to take a swing at this one sure I can have your feeling Pepe a change\nThat that it eighty seven thousand miles is I Would say a hundred ... this is Vince and Vince I'm winging that's I'm making a hundred thousand it's probably about the the uh interval on that and sent that squeaking it's telling you maybe there's I mean I Would go ahead and change ... nothing bad will happen I'm worried about\nThe eleven years yeah there you go it's the time and the elements of eleven years is a is a long time\nMost recommendations are going to be half of that to replace the main accessory built on a lot of these vehicles now having said that I've had numerous ones that I've taken past the five to say I really wouldn't do that but but if you're certainly if it's starting to talk to you and they believe it's coming from the belt\nOr you want to look at the belt and there are some of the ... and things like that that they make\nIf you look into it in in the parts catalog and they have a\nCommon sold part it's a ... for that vehicle that can sometimes be an indication that get the kitten replace all the push replaced the rollers and everything like that but if it's just a tiny trip I Would start with the low hanging fruit put the belt on it while the belt is off having just inspect all the idol or pulleys and different things to make sure nothing is\nExceptionally loose and you should be just fine so I'm more concerned about the fact that it's got eleven years on it almost twelve than I Am about eighty seven thousand miles\nIf he called and said the exact same thing it was this vehicle and it had it worked fine Rand fine he wants to buy it and it has never had the serpentine belt change\nYou would say just about change about you know I I definitely don't change the belt and so that things that people forget\nQuite a bit is that it's not always the miles at the time and in the time that something's been in service has to do with the elements if if that had been in a climate controlled storage and never been out in the elements you get the\nAdvantage of making that stuff last longer but the the rubbers in in the tires or the belt the hoses all these different things they do degrade overtime just from the from the elements of the of the of the earth or\nWorking on it speaking of the same thing we had a call I was listening to a recent pod cast and we had a call from a guy who had an oath to tourists and we were talking about higher where and whether the tires need to re replaced and date codes on tires and I got to thinking about an oath to tourists and he said it was he didn't drive and it was in great condition\nIs that a classic that's something you ensure as a classic not quite right how did how did we had our friends at Berkeley classics\nOr how they would take that and that's a process that or else seriousness if you had a car like that and you thought it was getting to be a classic\nUh and you're keeping it for that reason I Would definitely reach out to Berkeley classics dot com and ask

that Ninety crown Victoria that we had earlier today and and now the fact that he uses that as the daily driver would probably disqualify it\nOr can you drive your vehicle you around with a classic car insurance like our friends at Berkeley plastics most definitely but there are parameters that they need to talk about so I think that the two tourists would be it's working its way into that window for sure and then you just go back by degree\nAnd it becomes a planet what a window\nI'm starting to see things now people are put up as classics that are kind of making me smile like oh I'm

I'm ... oh my gosh the the uh ... ... ... ... ... ...\nThat used to clean water heaters what is it contains a [noise] a\nActually a what is ... contain it contains food grade citric acid ... so yeah this new cartridge system\nUtilizes hey citric acid based [noise]\nMeans a\n... of ... conditioning the water because we know that citric acid works great for cleaning up calcium and lying on heard have you heard how that\nIs kept how would that maintained as a cartridges cartridge every six months and are the kinds of you know the prices\nOf I don't but I Know that they're growing in popularity and I also know that I don't think there's anything as effective as the salt system I think if you really want soft water that\nThis whole system is still the best ... I didn't say that it was the most ... ecological or green or whatever but I think it's still the best in my experience based on having\nHad that system well near adults have had the cartridge I have the Carter chair do have a a citric acid cartridge I Do have a sister cast a car and how's that working for you\nUm [noise]\nI still have spot but they don't claim that they'll eliminate all the spots uh-huh or don't have calcium build up but still have spot it seems like\nThe ... detergent the shampoo this so we can use less\nThat that will go farther ha ha ha no build up of calcium on faucets and that sort of thing so it for my money it's a great alternative\nAre certainly a lot less well this fighting you say you still have spots to have as many as with the conventional you know [noise]\nSame

stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles ended up contract and and everyone feels that in their in their upper ... right as a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries\nOh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive\nDifficulties and I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen health and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting on life you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest\nWow all due to a simple lack of these new tests\nThe calcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon

stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say\nI'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drifts little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nKnock your biggest you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because\nThe calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the transmitters and the nerve and when you take this ... formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back mhm and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour\nI was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nOr heart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary early and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't it amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from five ...\nWhere she was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw or the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer may turn out to her friends\nAnd that's amazing and when I use this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles Oregon real relax shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication so many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and ...\nThese things also blocked the absorption of calcium needs them in the system well so the very drugs that are training the conditions that your body is experiencing because that's deficient in cows they many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nSomething so it's really it's really a rat race\nIt sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have

school of thought among rabbis before Jesus and during his time on earth a man could divorce\nHis wife for certain the for serving him something which had too much seasoning or the wrong seasoning about it or if it was her and so I'm right by taught that demand could divorce his wife if he found another that he liked better was more beautiful\n\nIf she may ... but did not keep her about if she went out in the street with her hair lose if she were to converse with any man if she were a noisy woman who spoke so lovely do that in her own how the neighbors will be able to hear that speaking\nWere other reasons for which a man could divorce has what it was all a part of that not finding favor not pleasing her husband\nAs David ... twenty four\nWhich is where that business of allowing the risk of divorce comes from\nThis is a bit of the law which Jesus gifts he was here in Mark Penn\nState's very clearly the wrongness of divorced and remarried and it isn't a sharp work it's a hard word because yeah it's a word of the law and one of the basic teachings of those early Lutheran the illusion is that the law always accuses\nAnd the statement from Jesus certainly does that\nThe law accuses and more often than not we are guilty when the law starts to accuse\nAnd this is one of those really hard passages isn't it because divorce is something with which we are all too familiar we know and love people who are divorced some of them are remarried and they stand by stand accused by\nThis law which Jesus said\nSo the temptation of course is well how do you often at work or changes or maybe try to make\nIt see something that it doesn't say\nThat are all the preacher could bail to the first lesson her second lesson or maybe preach on that great song he just the change of pace\n[noise] really avoid the text but this has been read and it has been hurt\nSo we will deal with it\nThe other temptation is to ask so what do you do with this text instead of that writes better question what does this text to do with us\nAs I read this tax I remember some of those readings from a couple of weeks before\nThat we've had in the gospel\nThere is travel between last week's reading and this week's first ten chapter one tells us that Jesus has gone from ... in galley down to Judy across the Jordan is now on the east side of the Jordan River\nBut the subject is still the same last week it was about that may mean if we send better to enter heaven maimed the to enter hell\nHole\nBit extreme\nAnd last week I was up at St Matthew than your time Lutheran and I'm just to let you know there was no one at St Matthew's her way of time that had any missing\nParts either so I'm not sure what that says\nSo is this talk about divorce Jesus just kind of doing the same thing this extreme language I mean you remember the punishment for adultery after all\nThey drag the woman caught in adultery to Jesus stones ready\nAnd yeah if you don't have the thin you can go ahead and cast a\n\nSo wouldn't it be nice to say yeah this is Jesus just be an extreme but\n\nThat would let us off the hook maybe but no not really because even if Jesus is being extreme what he is saying is that divorce is bad\nAnd it should not be happening that's the law that as being laid down the divorce the remarriage and again it's not that rules that we want to see Jesus in again we know\nPeople who are divorced\nWe we know\nDivorce and I think it's fair to say that it is not a pleasant experience and that's probably a very large understatement it's not something you want to do but\nIt's made as a choice because sometimes it's the only choice of left to be made the least of the bad options might be one way of describing\nIt\nAnd Jesus is laying down the law here and and I think we should not\nAvoid acknowledging that because the law is given by God for the sake of community it has given so that the people of Israel can live well with each other and with God in this new land that they are about to inherit\nIt is given\nSo that the community is can be healthy so that there can be healthy relationship with God and especially with each other\nAnd with what has been all over the news in recent days regarding Supreme Court\nWould seem to be a good example of community and relationships which really seem to have broken down a whole bunch\nDo you believe in God the Holy Spirit\nI

sergeant harmful to spend until the charges arms or store order and the gallery Collins said she'd vote to confirm Kavanaugh\nThe allegation fails to me the more likely than not standard there before I Do not believe that he charges had barely heard bad\nJudge cabin up credit surfing on the court\nCorrespondent Allison Keyes has been covering Kavanaugh's confirmation Alison how do you think this is politicized the Supreme Court a body that as opposed to be independent and fair\nI think that there are a lot of questions about that many Democrats in their testimony brought up the fact that he attach the Democratic party\nAnd since the Supreme Court is supposed to be the quarter of the country that is completely nonpartisan there are a lot of people that are concerned about that Republicans of course say that everything's fine he's just going to vote along constitutional lines but there are concerns both from Democrats and from some Supreme Court experts that I've heard over the past couple of days\nThat saved this as a man that became angry in public this was a man that brought up all sorts of conspiracy theories involving Democrats at that Senate hearing last week so it's a question as to what would happen if he if he is confirmed to the court\nWe've been hearing stories for more women coming forward to share their own accounts for sexual assault what effect do you think Christine Blasey Ford's allegation against Kavanaugh has\nI think the effect of her allegation for one thing it galvanized a lot of women who had not had anything to say about what happened to them to come forward there were people all over Twitter at all over social media who said yes has happened to me too but it's a little bit beyond the me too movement because\nThese are women who are professional women who are afraid of losing their jobs who are afraid of their of the people they say attack them coming after them but when this woman that in that Senate hearing room\nWith her blonde hair looking terrified a lot of people thought wow this means that I should come forward and share my story and maybe I should filed charges against my accuser I I think a galvanized a whole movement but I think it also set up a counter movement because as President Trump said the other day\nNow what happens if you are a boy edge but boy child or a man who is accused of sexual assault right so what does that mean for you there's been a lot of debate about that on both sides if you didn't do it and someone says you did do it than what your defense does that mean that your career should be destroyed and we should note of course that they are victims of sexual abuse of both sexes what\nDo you think about gender lines when it comes down to a reaction to that testimony from blogs before to and from Kavanaugh some woman were saying it was before and went in there and testified with the same kind of emotion perhaps your reaction that the cabin all had that will be a different story for her\nI think it's interesting that you said that because there were a lot of people comparing her testimony to Anita Hill obviously who testified against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill went in with this very professional very calm demeanor and people felt that if she had been more emotional states that\nThat that outcome would have been different but I think that\nBy my watching it and from what I fear from some other journalists that I've spoken to people think that Ford was trying to walk a very difficult line as a woman who's been assaulted of course your emotional about what happened to you but\nOn the other hand you can't be hot crying mess because you are in a room where all the Republicans on that committee were men and older men who\nTend not to believe accusations of that sort\nI spoke to people of both sexes who watched that hearing and the thing that struck me was more women were angry about the way cabinet responded with anger the way that the\nAttacks some senators so the women I spoke to were kind of offended by that but the men I spoke to were like well heck yeah this is true that he should have responded with that kind of fury because that's what I Would have done if someone said that I had a track someone when I did not attack them\nHow much of an impact on do you think this vote has on the elections next\nI think
