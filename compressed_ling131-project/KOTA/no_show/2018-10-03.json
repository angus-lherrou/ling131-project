everything I don't remember the people after what happened last Wednesday I I couldn't tell I don't have a we had on the show\nIf you asked me who was on the segment before me on the angle on friday aren't I literally could not to remember that I don't either people say oh I Love your show last week I said who was on I don't I I I I just put when it's over it's over I just put it out of my head

everybody as or do you create you create different fact\nIn your mind to justify your current action or a and you and it it it's ... it's a\nBut and then when you enter the hero hypnosis psychotherapy which some I'm kind of fascinated by I read this I've read about this in passing but this is an area that touches on this Christine forthright and\nChristine forward herself um what is the co author of study citing the use of hypnosis to retrieve memory very interesting the federalist had a really good piece about this yesterday Shawn Davis um the academic paper entitled meditation with yoga\nGroup therapy with hypnosis and psycho education\nFor a long term depressed mood a randomized pilot trial described the results of a study on that tested the efficacy of certain treatments of forty six depressed individuals\nI felt the paper was by Ford in in other co authors and it focused on whether various therapeutic techniques including hypnosis alleviate depression also discuss the therapeutic use of hypnosis to assist in the retrieval of important memories and to create artificial situations\nTo assist in treatment\nUm that's kind of interesting and when she when she was asked about remembering some details and not remembering others\nRemember she went it it's it into its indelible it's indelible in the hippocampus\nRemember she responded with that very sort of technical like ooh were impressed but you but your handwriting is like a fourth grader and you say me and my husband\nHoward ones so sure that it was the same way that I'm sure that I'm Talking to you right now it's just basic memory functions on and as\nAlso at the level of nor epinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that sort of as you know in codes that nerve transfer includes memories and to they had the campus and stuff that trauma related experience then it's kind of locked there where it either he has kind of dress\nWell actually there's a lot of information about trauma and false memories syndrome and false identification in particularly stressful environment I treated some of that out last week so\nAs you can remember a certain situations and details you also can falsely retrieve information again for a variety of reasons what your mind want you to know what your mind wants you to think\nWhen you're you you can also supplant memories and Ripley certain memories so if I'm traumatized someone walks up to me in an alley and I catch a glimpse of them\nIf you go into a certain hypnotic state if you go into certain psychotherapy and you go to a tree those memories at times your mind whether consciously or unconsciously switches faces moments memories\nAnd leaves them over others so that you begin to think no that was Laura in that out she was in the corner that alley she witnessed it\nI saw her there well no that was a year later that was a different events but the mind starts to conflate these things and trauma and I I don't that's why I'm looking forward to hearing from the trauma ally\n... well sure it's an end to other things that we find self reference effect we remember things better when they're related to ourselves\nAnd so you know Detroit to the U.S with a more attention to it and so we we hold back and then we also have a confirmation bias where we got to see the world through the lens that we want to see it and so those two things can kind of create a dynamic where if somebody is is a\nA as a motivation to remember something a certain way I could certainly them end up with a false member and outcome that goes with that\nSo when you when you try to then dig down and determine\nThe truth of what happens let's say in a legal context how have you seen or experience expert witness testimony to ... to convince jurors jurors or maybe it's impossible that that's not the only thing to weigh\nRight well I mean you're an attorney so you know that you've got to have other evidence we've got to be corroborating evidence and it's much I'm hard evidence that you can find a support something if you're if you're going to to pursue that\nBecause otherwise any allegation that has any allegation made against anyone or any of us are uncorroborated any contemporaneous ah substantiate and that that if\nIf the person who was alleging it is really passionate said my God this and in a sympathetic figure and that's all it is not a good luck anyone getting a job anywhere it's pretty harshly well\nThat and that's one of the problems here that we see is that this is not a legal process that we're seeing a cabinet case if the court of public opinion so the rules of fair play and and the judicial system seemed to be out the window\nAnd Dr Robert Mather what are you working on now what what are you doing now that's fun freer researched\nAh well I Do some research on a I'm a multi level marketing and so I'm different ah aspects of of the um [noise] you know behavior and and the testimonials that people can provide that that may make others more or less susceptible to a multi level marketing\nWow Mm okay that's a really interesting how people think oh you can make the money here you can do this you can do it\nAgain you want the outcome you believe you believe the set of facts that will get you to the outcome that you desire\nSure what the the most persuasive factor that I keep finding is that it's the the person's testimonial is the most so it's worked for me in the past and and hearing somebody say that makes them more likely to to to go in and listen to the\nSame thing when you're buying a pair of

this thing oh yeah the new news on the midterms is terrible for the Democrats I mean\nHere's some of the stories that we're seeing Heidi Heitkamp Democrat in North Dakota it's now under water with the G O P uh or Kevin Cramer is a congressman from North Dakota challenging the incumbent Democrat and of course the are likely voters that's the key measure we want to always in a poll likely voters\nUm they were contact between September seventeenth and just last week September twenty seven and\nIt allows a U.S to examine at least partially how some of this Kavanaugh effect might be percolating into the mid term calculus\nA high camp is one of two Democratic senators who has not yet announced how they will vote on the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court the full Senate of course expected voted that set on friday\nThe poll also shows that likely voters in North Dakota are overwhelmingly in support of confirming Kavanaugh to the court\nOr sixty percent of likely voters in North Dakota support the nomination of Kavanaugh keep in mind the poll was conducted before the disclosure that the judge may have engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school or before last week the

said\nWell David socks and the old ahead of on\nThe during the Reagan Administration was considered a young of budget guru economical room was pulling the idea of a re doing now so that was going to help a well guess what the president announced yesterday that they had a\nWell to put it in the I'll put it in a way that our next guest will not\nUltimately candidate came to censor it didn't want to be odd man out and came into the deal with Mexico and the United states and the new deal is called the U.S Mexico Canada agreement or otherwise known as us and the CIA joining us now the man that was

podium which was you know several cabinet members but also the great members of professional staff at us today are are just terrific people have been working around the clock for months on this there everybody has sort of walks in their knees and kind of stumbled off and the\nAnd I'm just one other funny thing the people on the president's left\nUp in the corner we're all sort of sunburned on one side of their face those of us in the shade it wasn't a problem but it was it was it was wild it was fun it was a it was a fun time and kind of a reward for my people working so hard to get some are important tree done\nSo it probably doesn't surprise you that the wall Street Journal today is like on cue\nTheir lead editorial a a new NAFTA relief is the title and the new deal is worse than the status quo but disaster was avoided um and it's very specific criticisms but\nI hear your reaction to the naysayers who are out there saying that well you stripping protections against predatory government behavior promotes foreign investors\nOr the new deal also take the giant step toward politically managed trade by imposing new rules of origin labor wreck I let you take off on a couple of those\nWell I mean I don't want to specifically focus on the wall Street Journal they've been sort of against the idea of changing after from the beginning you have to start with the with the the\nPosition was NAFTA in its current state good or bad well we have large deficits\nEvery everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgrade it is a crazy and then in addition to changes in the economy we had very large deficits and\nWe were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parks and companies are to Mexico and other places so the people who say we shouldn't have to have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just to you know engaging in self deception and I might I might know that both\nThe secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nThat would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned gotten so what the president did which I which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trade bloc in in history at one point\nTrillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who have to pay my bills and do I care about and better in a whole variety of ways\nIt's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America\nThe there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis we call it a review provision their labor rights which had never been like this ever in an agreement before there's\nAccess on agriculture there's there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital pray middle actual property protection financial services all these\nThese ah twenty first century economy kinds of things there were no adequate rules and now we have on there is even very good rules\nAre on the environment which are beyond anything we've negotiated before which I'm I'm proud of there's there's very\nStrong enforceable rules on currency which we've never had an a trade agreement before there there are limitations on data local is Asian which is an important thing for the digital trade people we have limitations on how state owned enterprises\nWhich is you think China Ken subsidize so there's\nThere's a whole variety of things in various pockets to extremely important to Graham it better than than anything in the states as ever to go she had it before it's going to make a real

one of the things that were wondering how this works in a still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing where there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly that there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because\nLet's go to a Brenda in Ohio not enough again but Brenda\nFlorida um my parents have a for their entire life worked in

staged and\nAstro turf a and Republicans are you like you know three or four of them end up holding up a confirmation of an unsubstantiated with an unsubstantiated claims ... what are your thoughts and we'll get into the specifics about the accuser\nWell I think this was a feminist Warren culture I think that's the bigger picture that's going on here and it is definitely based on the premise of presumed guilt before in a sense that men are found guilty because they are part of a group\nIt's you know no individual guilt on anymore it's collective guilt and this is very dangerous for our society it's dangerous for men obviously but for all of that because if we start going down this road even in the public sphere even the public arena um it's going to enter into our court system\nWe have enough security and our democracy if\nWe allow this to happen and people are saying is that he he doesn't have a right to the Supreme Court well\nAnd accuser does not have the right to be believed\nThey just simply don't this message about women's within ... worth that we are to believe them simply because they're women simply because there are many of them are victims that there have been abuses in the past but this isn't that the standard by which we judge people we judge people on stock rationality and the judge people\nBased on what can we present the evidence and not feeling and this attack on Kavanaugh's grilling how about you know do you remember blacking out the remember getting drunk how you behave in college and just\nThe presumption of guilt going forward and in every way that they have questioned him and it's it's completely dangerous inappropriate\nNow describe if you don't mind your thoughts on ah Christine forward given your a knowledge of her as an undergraduate\nRight I I was a classmate of hers I wasn't in her ... friendship here but I was in her circles and\nI Know the environment that she was on that we were all in especially our freshman and sophomore year we were partying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture at what point and bringing it up as not to blame her\nFor her you know if she were if she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way deserve to get raped but my point is is if you only have said she said if you don't have any corroborating evidence then you need to look at the character of both people need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing at college\nAnd you know we should be if you're going to grill Brett Kavanaugh adopted she also needs to be looked at as well because she's bringing these accusations without any kind of corroborating evidence and you can't forget that weight\nAnd she also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that yes she did well in high school you know really what was going on during that period shops that changed the timeframe from being\nIn the mid eighties or early eighties she kept pushing it back and forth but did it happen in college or that happened in high school you know really flush out exactly what her story is next year on the stand the lawyer would grill or about that they would grow about the details of her comment on how we have to hold her with kid gloves\nRight then again feminists are supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own they're not a bunch of damsel in distress and yet\nI you're exactly right on the ... last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to the a credibility gap ah for moves forward a in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who was a sex crime prosecutor who not political figure who said look changing narratives changing story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change\nOr is unclear a not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a\nI'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard so no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of corroborating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nWell that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because I didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest\nI'm and she didn't she didn't vote like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing but so Trump\nTraumatized her for four years thirty six years

the only one that had real long term potential he bought it\nNow in France and South Korea and Japan in the way most European countries\nIf say for example Comcast to use the example I mean you know I don't know that they're operating in those countries but if they were operating in France\nAnd and you got your Internet firm Comcast\nYou could say well you know I really don't like Comcast Internet\nService it's a particularly don't like the fact that they're reading my emails and tracking everything I Do so I'm going to go with the acme secure Internet service I'm going to have them as my Internet service provider 'cause they don't tracked me and they provide better security\nWhere they're faster or they're cheaper I mean there's all kinds of different ways it in a service providers can compete\nAnd to compete which is why typically you know high speed Internet and I'm Talking high high speed hundred mess up and down high speed Internet in Europe is you know twenty to fifty bucks a month depending on where you live here in the United states has fifty two hundred dollars him\nThese companies are getting mind boggling Lee Rich I mean Comcast made so much money in this business that they were able to buy NBC\nI mean just breathtakingly rich\nAnd T. by CNN I mean it's just it's wow how'd you get all that money oh because we're essentially allowing these monopolies\nAnd if this is our new infrastructure if these are our our rivers and fields and then and plans and if that's what this is\nWe are shooting ourselves in the foot hugely number one by killing a net neutrality so that these companies not only can lock down you know can lock us into to their Internet services which they can do before you know before the death and ...\nBut also by allowing them to extract from us all this information without our um\nYou know those he asked a consent anyway and then sell that information or market that information or use that information to market things to us\nYou know everybody understands that Facebook is march ... he became a a hyper billionaire\nBased on his ability to know everything about everybody so that advertisers could say you know I only want women between the ages of twenty five and thirty five who live in a in a house worth Seventy Seventy two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a suburban area in the state of Ohio right and and uh they can say okay here you go\nAnd pretty soon Comcast will be able to do the same thing and all the other Internet service providers here in the United states\nYou know which is going to make them even richer but what does it do to us as a country it makes it harder for start ups and get into the Internet particularly if you have to pay extra fees they have high speed transmission it it makes all of us a little dumber I\nMean and then on top of that you've got the algorithms you know Chris Hedges was here talking about this yesterday the Google algorithm that has said that alter net and a truth dig in

for good information that might have a progressive ... to it you won't find it on Google\nAnd many of the other search services basically use Google as their ... so you're not going to find it on them either although there's really no consequential competition\nSo what does this mean for the United states it seems to me that in the interests of monopoly and ... and short term profits\n\nThese companies are buying off legislators particularly the Republican Party but I'm sure that they own a a you know their own little portfolio and Democrats or they wouldn't have been able to get a lot you know away with this this long\nAnd\nThe politicians having sold out to these Internet service providers are now destroying essentially or that a walking up I mean it's as if to say okay the ... one of the reasons Germany is a prosperous is because they have lots and lots of fertile farmland and they've got the Rhine River running right through the middle of the country\nOr one of one company or I had five giant companies came along and said we now own all the farmland and we now on the river and anybody who does anything on either one has to do it through us\nHow would that and say that

figure out why the Democratic party doesn't bring criminal charges against him in state court are they not allowed to bring charges against him in state court\nOr why aren't they doing anything about the perjury right\nYeah and I would add Bill Clinton was can was impeached for perjury and was just barred he lost his law license for perjury yeah I was in\nSome of this on the most recent you know perjury is around like\nYou know what the yearbook sudden things I you know people would argue whether or not their material there are strong enough that you could get to that level I Would argue with people have kind of forgot about 'em because of the very serious allegations by Dr Ford\nOr that we're forgetting that he probably committed perjury for or maybe five times in some previous testimony that I actually I think is more substantial right that he lied bay previously when he was before the Senate for confirmation according to center a former senator Russ Feingold from Wisconsin so\nUm I I think what people have been saying and I think this is probably the most relevant to offer Marcia is that you know I'm we're going to do everything we can to stop this nomination for a lot of very valid reasons but should he get through and should we win the majority we can do hearings on this\nAnd we can really get to the bottom of this and you know there is a process to impeach I'm not saying

after a Kevin I was I just I've been hearing a lot about um you know especially\nWith Senator Flake was was confronted by victims of sexual assault\nYou know I'm a victim of a false fabricated sexual assault allegation that's a place that I could tell you that the Nineteen months to that that I went through before that was resolved and I was exonerated was the most painful most depressing and the most embarrassing time in my life and I almost lost everything that I worked hard for all those years\nYou know you just said that you just said you didn't appreciate the way the terminal\nReacted to the senator's well I'll tell ya I felt his anger because that's how I Know\nYou know and I feel it's not fair for somebody to judge somebody else in that situation unless you walk mine when their shirts and the other issue that I have is your process here you know if by the standards that you know some people are advocating for where you know accusations are treated as fact\nI today would be considered a sexual offender or violence sexual offender for an active I absolutely did not commit and I would not have any opportunity to be in the points that I Am right now\nAnd it hurts me to see that I see that within the bill of rights of the ... rights you process you can't ... personal life liberty without due process\nI don't see anything in there where there's a right for a person to be able to have to have justice on every instance it happens but it's it to me it's a bigger deal and it should be a bigger deal for many Americans if you deprive person I've been in the early ... right\nOver over you know\nThe fact that you're a victim of any crime may not get the justice that they deserve it's an imperfect system which the system that we have and what differentiates us from oppressive regimes and others dictatorship\nSpecially since Labor Day so that is true but we have to get all of them out to vote because they may be with us now but we've got to make sure they're with us in a few weeks to get out to vote which is why all the activities that everyone's doing across the country right now campaigning are really are going to be the determining factor whether or not people come out and vote\nTravel is listening to am Thirteen fifty in Albuquerque New Mexico you're I think it was ...\nHello I'm a business travel is a talking I'd have to know\nOkay thank you I'm

uh I just actually ... ah last week\nWednesday or Thursday sat down with John Sarbanes from Maryland is kind of leading are a good government efforts I'm On a task force with him he's leading it\nAnd one of the vice chairs and we've got probably a we're advocating for each are one the first bill we introduced to be a bill that deals with a electoral reform campaign finance reform and ethics reform on one bill and I am advocating very strongly to get something added about paper ballots 'cause uh I already have legislation\nThat does just that but I think you know if people want that a confidence that their ballot or should there be a recount we actually have a physical specimen that we can take a look at and count so I'm hoping that that will get added I'm Still advocating for that but you make a great point um that will add a lot to the confidence in our elections\nJohn in Auburn, Washington will set came UCS you're on the air with cars invoking\nHi this is John thank you Tom for taking my call and I'm good to hear your again I'm\nI'm a little I'm impressed by how vociferous and angry we've become over the possible sexual assault of a joke\nBut\nYou know it seems like the Democrats have dropped the ball on the Ninety percent of the materials that his government service while he was working for George W ...\nI'm a Republican is where he we just did not get to find out almost anything about his record of service and what he was actually doing during that time\nDuring the time he worked for ... you know I'm Sorry\nI hear your call call call waiting kept blocking what you were saying job so I was just repeating Jersey Bush a congressman your thoughts\nYeah even John I I think what we're what's happening right now is what's capturing the public's attention\nAnd they may not be I'm exactly enthralled by or what happened when he worked under George W Bush because not everyone follows politics as closely as we all do but what they really understand is a when a woman makes a very credible accusation and is really a dismissed\nThe way she's been Dr Ford has been dismissed\nAnd then the good old boy a ah I like beer network kicks in I think that's what's capturing people's attention and saying you know let's have that proper F being by a investigation why wouldn't you want to have it right and just it's something that people can relate to very easily and feel very emotionally about and I think that's why that just is what's getting most\nOf the attention um you know I also think that you know his lying in the previous testimony four or five times\nIs the significance but right now I think we're the public that is on this moment and Dr Ford's testimony and the other women's ... I'm a ... now say testimonies but accusations and what that means moving forward so that just puts captured the public's interest right now\nNancy listen and the ... and Wisconsin you're on the air with Congress and poke him\nYeah one thing I'm worried about listening to Michael Lewis interview which was ... his book should be very very good his articles in Vanity Fair we're absolutely frightening I think we're in a really great situation if Trump doing something off the wall like\nYou know ... ... whatever that would really upset China if they would cut us off I mean other than you know the um [noise] stuff to make our missiles and everything but like everything you need in the hospital including our drop are from China is there something without\nAppearing to social less you know that the government can do to put this in reverse [noise] [noise]\nYeah well I think Nancy and when it comes to China you know this is all very educated Donald Trump talks a real tough game\nBut don't forget you know when he became president that's when he started getting some the trademarks for his family businesses right with China and if you really want to address the in my opinion one of the very biggest problems that we have in relation to trade with China its currency manipulation China is a manipulator of their currency and you can have the best\nOf laws written or you can have tariffs in place and all that can be manipulated by currency and because of the power of the financial institutions or that's not something we are going after so once again I don't even know if his rhetoric matches his actions because he's not going after what would really provide substantial change instead\nYou're doing this chair for which there's a lot we could discuss on that good and bad a\nBut he's not going at the real problem because of the\nFinancial institutions and if I can add Tom in NAFTA that's one of the areas I think that guy weekend was around financial institutions also\nYeah ouch county in Lakewood, Colorado my than your name right\n... or ... yeah I did hear on the air with Rand Paul\nHi there I'm yeah I did you get your take on this I uh I'm the cabin I hearings and he's not really on a ... a criminal trial is not a civil trial isn't it more or less a fancy job interview\nAnd they keep pushing it in his life not ruined if he doesn't get the job he'll probably go back to being a judge when he was doing before um I I'm just wanting to get your take on it and of course we all know why they're pushing capping off but\nWe're sending the rules of criminal and civil trial when\nHe's really not on trial technically but what do you think of that\nWell I mean they're ... they're testing his uh uh truthfulness his character or that's what they're looking at but you're right it is it's a job interview that getting one of the best lines from Saturday Night live wasn't in that ... they did of the the hearing\nBut later when I'm I think it's Michael J. ah said um you know generally if you're bringing up your uh drunkenness and a um a sexual assault in an interview you're not going to get the job writing and you'd think that that would be significant enough the fact that these are the conversation\nAnd then when he lied to the members of the Senate on a number of definitions and trying to recreate yeah let's face it he he told us he likes beer very clearly we know he likes beer I think I'm from his actions I've got that feeling he was a pretty belligerent a drunk when he was a younger person and that alone shouldn't be disqualifying\nHowever if ah there are the sexual assault allegations any lying about what happened at the time on other things\nThat certainly adds to the credibility of someone who is to be pointed to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court so I think all of these are valid or parts of the discussion that came out\nAnd I think you know hopefully the Senate Republicans actually look at it on its merits rather than just they're going to get this because they might lose the Senate on November sex and I think they make some huge mistakes\nAnd and also just you know on how you treat people I mean I hopefully this is putting a real emphasis on sexual assault and the me too movement I heard there have been a lot more people reporting sexual assaults because of this and maybe it's opening up\nUm the cover up of all the congressmen and have been paid off or\nAbusing women ... Alice in or Cory Booker their accusers I'm ... sorry could you say it again\nIt's a he's a suggestion that Keith Allison ... it was just you know the guy trying to get the same here Keith Ellison by the way the charges against him were just does proven yesterday\nUm and I don't know anything about Cory Booker but\nYeah that's you know lots of um ... sort of talking point yeah picking a male and the last Democrat and you know yeah yeah it's it's a that's that's awful stuff\nYeah ... ... ... or or Oso California here on the air is congressman poking\nOh thank you first time a long time and I wanted to ask Congress is there any way that we can put there's judge appointment off until the next election away the Republicans did\n'em by the rules they're going by no uh that's the problem if they have a Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski a no they'll have the votes lined up the question is\nYou know is this going to be um a thorough real FBI investigation which everyone's asked for or is this going to be some kind of a abbreviated or more narrow one which then didn't resolve the problem at all uh we're we're yet to find that out and hopefully we will this week\n[noise] Gordon listening to a serious like salmon Jasper, Oregon you're on the air ...\nHi I'm Tom ... and then congressman\nMy question is a camera you hold the Republican a committee ... plus the air they vote for Kevin on knowing he's perjured and so\nIs there any kind of late for them or outside of having them out of office\nNot really I don't believe so other than a obviously the you know their constituents could say you didn't do a thorough job you didn't uh do what you were elected to therefore we're not going to keep you in office\nWell I thought we'd check in with our residents psychiatrist Dr Peter bragging who dozens of course school pets when it comes to depression but he might know about this Peter this is a weird story\nOr no judge is a beautiful story at at dogs love us of\nCourse they do and they're like small children too they also can just go into abandon meant\nBecause they feel needy my little ... just whales hideously\nLandline digital leaves the house\nAnd I can I can even you know generally more and more I'm able to get her to calm down and just to sit with me I think I think we we have a lot to learn from dog for example I mean if if our dog is is getting an easy because with ... what about our kids what about our NPR oh yeah\nAbsolutely that's a good\nOver there and I think we've learned over evolution social evolution of awful lot about love dogs the dogs come into our community\nOr ten twenty thousand years ago and that's the same time we are becoming more and more civilized more and more creative more and more spiritual burying things with us to go to heaven with and\nThen the afterlife and I think dogs that they make a big role in letting us know about the need for love and attention and and also giving us unconditional love I I just think that there's so much more important when we may think and how we at the ballot\nBitter when the dog's depressed what what is it do what are the signs\nWell it's it's not so different from a a human being they can get off if food they can just lie around they can be not interested in things\nUm in fact the animals and in general a will behave that way chimpanzees if the parents die when when when they were only three of four year old mother died in ... a year and\nAnd they become depressed than some time they an older sibling can move than a and started giving love the little one the one we can learn from the higher animal freak of them\nIs that uh we need to pay more attention to the needs of human beings children stop making believe that we're all suffering\nBake bio chemical and balances and if that racket died\nThat humans have probably even more sensitive and and in need of a relationship and love and attention then our dogs and cats than and chimpanzees and\nWe we we just um you know the veterinarians is showing more concern for the dog would did this article and I pediatricians have shown\nOr here in St Peter thanks for the observation Peters website bragging B.

companies\nHe's the executive director of the climate science coalition of America which is an independent non political association of scientists and concerned citizens focusing on informing all of us about the realities of climate science and energy economics his book outside the green box\nIs in my hand right now Steve welcome to the program good to have you with us\nA very good night to you George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York wow and what do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of the dignitaries their their goals from the website where that they were run into a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action\nOr some big notable Tony Blair form of of a prime minister of England spoke Ban Ki moon from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nHuh all the ... you know over in spoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public\nRelations steel claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached and three hundred news articles written so a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would the and a lot of the folks there I think believe that if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears ...\nIf we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build the wind turban towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they are I Know\nHave never been a fan of that because you know I I I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix them\nAs real pollution when it affects that's correct\nI don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think words solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd uh you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are ... what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nThings like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide so for a day I'm like mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas\nAnd what I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nHis we will take your emails of your ghost stories and Tom is collecting\nFolks send us your stories we need um Halloween is coming up so you can email your stories give us a good story and give us your phone number Halloween story and coast to coast am dot com

A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call now\n...\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether there's global warming climate change we don't want for you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title for\nSure well that's a that this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you\nA written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over and think outside the box so the title was think outside the green box\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green box of sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction\nUh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy\nI'm a and they're taught in universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun read it say a color paperback and\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper why the wait for the size of a heavy book [laughter]\nWell I don't know about that but a lot to the ... to put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which got to summarize the some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nWith climate change should with what's happened I'm I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you ...\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nCould be temporary because Saudi Arabia ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas golds theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs and plans\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including ...\nYou know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth of the earth also produces materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of\nOf some that his fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the balls and the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the combination of hydrocarbons instead\nOn who you know what am I simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet it's way way down there oh yeah glance and dead animals get down there\nThey're finding and now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you've got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been\nA rats and other vermin or out of the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty are\nSix major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide\nOur water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel river as as may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worst state so it's really a good news story what we need to do is get\nGet the nations to become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and started cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless one side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match and yeah it\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October him and a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to a climate discussion\nI'm so it has become very polarized and do you get booted no I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and ...\nTo the university professor who's accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault joking about

consuming it's expensive\nThat's why it takes a super food we've created a blend of the best USDA organic vine ripe and fruits and vegetables powerful enzymes in probiotics an energizing herbs all in a convenient kept solar powder we call it Texas super food complete organic\nAs to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy ... these Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie\nCalled the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it a remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or what art and uh what these protections ... very well happen that the ...\nThat's portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork the blow in Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the bans in both of those movies that very well happen\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that's okay no although I understand there's a big went under their you know the call during the day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nI'm a manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the ah a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water or the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks in it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian or the Pacific the the theory basically\nWas that are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop that current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next\nUh ice age um I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the corrupt so are there were there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing\nDown but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down is really not happening and it was a good movie though\nYeah OK this kind of thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what's what can you give us an update on that\nAll act and still making it\nStill doing it spinning whoa okay go ahead John\n... and my dad started to uh to quiet down I just want to say you were you were talking about wind bill ... when I when I was living in Oregon\nOkay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was a twenty four what we're finding\nYou know they were were burning off a massive gaining ... were were hacked now why don't you put a generator on that and put it to\nYou know Chris city they'll come back and they said no no no it's going to cost to live here and everything out now that can't be the only landfill and the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go there man anything done about that\nBut I think they're recapturing that are in some places a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas\nOr they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um I guess from landfill it's about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills or but it does tend to that does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\n... let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi a yard and thank you for having Steve von Loor spoken to him several times that burden on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air and inside and accuracy up there is one point\nThat the other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past\nAnd I think we should warn are good friends she's not to make the the same mistake that these are the climate gate hopes are uh are using a bag lady I Believe you said a one point three billion\nPeople on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct yeah I think it's about\nIt's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion pd what else it's quite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nAll cat while I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to the two point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just the whole day or two dollars a day and four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will rich man and a a ... a\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion rights and and so\nSo what frosty has told us is this just sat in\nThinking that we can speak to your uh that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowing a ... somehow going to a massively improve their lives they're doing All right with out is that costs you will rich a lot of them are a ton of illegally into this country because they had been tricked\nAnd deceived into thinking they're going to get a better quality of life than they had down there because you're having a lot more money in their pocket but I yeah I didn't I didn't want to suggest\nThat we solve that problem by giving them money I don't think that's the right way I think the way is to uh is to ah help ah teach 'em to use free markets and a property rights and um a lot of others\nSorts of things that would help those economies to grow and you know the good news is that a those are those uh uh people are growing a we have about a\nAbout a I think it's about six hundred million people now that are under nourished across the world uh uh that's uh that's about the little less than ten percent of the world's population used to be thirty percent Thirty years ago\nSo are people are are getting more nourishment uh they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated um they used to be to every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds\nNow every decade it's less than a million people die so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] uh you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in Los Angeles hey barb welcome to the program good to have you with us\nI have a few things taken passed with your cats fine contests\nFirst of all um there's a lot of work being done with a tentative and aching and you have a fake it frequent guest on your head David Brown with alcohol and gas and there's all kinds of\nProjects with that and then secondly Oklahoma has more earthquake than we do in California from oil drilling fracking primarily\nAnd lawyers and actually that is true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like well that's what I mean by the ... yeah well you're right the indirectly it is\nBut uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nUrine possibility Steve that this entire planet should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope that never happens and and you know all we can do though with with these things is that down to that so we that's what we do with the storms that's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for\nA thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but what with weather but not on a global scale I'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nOut to British Columbia Canada we go to first time caller

things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate laws and the energy laws are foolish in many ways the headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of\nOf American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority of so it's a little bit of a strange situation um\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong\nIs is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions um are they concerned about any\n... well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a max of five ten so low of too tense and if you put those on a charge those rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we were fed much less than that so we're\nWe're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong\nAnd natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York east of the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nA state that threat from show uh actually I Want\nClimate change I wanted to be warmer but a lot of

a week and I was working with a papal cut up and shot at it on way and this thing so I I relate this to a\nMotion tempered shows how well monitored all ocean temperatures at the satellites come into

are in his shoes and ... and um\nYou know it does make me think that the senators\nThat book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hopes to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do\nA in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it so that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh we all tune in because we're hearing things that we can't get enough oil changes nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could in college where is the time\nWell I've had a couple of them are one of them are I called the ... falls\nIncident but one night I'll share with you a hug was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys are working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them or to this mountain in it and mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building hearts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day uh their focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey flyers using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the dark and\nUh now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area read night for the hike\nOr when they got up to it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about the year he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose or a monarchy or\nA that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne or the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance\nA light moving around in the woods now of course there first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or or you know battery operated lantern\nBut then they realize that this thing started daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it they could see that it was about two feet wide\nBluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming eating the trees around it so\nNow they're passing a there was that bright yeah I mean it it it it's a glowing light ... around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you're going to take a look at the cigarettes doing something really weird\nHe described a number picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described a co-op board\nComing out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow a bubble through warned as such are okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this orbit and making its way down to the ground and what blew the mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume up a little bit self and yet the\nWas on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they start to see a big foot appearing in this secondary door knob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking\nAt some point the glob separates from the org and now you have like this power of blue and white light with this big foot in it and the orb sitting separately it was then that they said\nThe bluish white light that was surrounding the big foot starts to dissipate where now\nAnd his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty Seventeen July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them are walking into this area\nOr to take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line for sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional but he had been doing it for twenty five years and never considered themselves to be a professional\nAt any rate there in the valley taking pictures\nAnd there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then know el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock emanates through the valley\nShow he's got his cameras set up under tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around\nAnd hit through a husband and I see something pacing around over there on the hill fried\nAnd he says what do you mean you see something pace and she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside to to like show he swings this time around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through there she's got it now he sees it\nAnd he says even though it was so small in his lens at the distance she was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging its arms up near\nUh like you said the nervous man waiting for a bus seemed very alert to yeah well a show then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the year

about just how big that is what this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nThen when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you talked about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWell so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates but they

I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women young girls and\nHave to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time of a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape\nYoung girls and it's gotten so absurd now that yeah but the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the

bringing drunk\nAll right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that a Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of professor forge a who's the California professor\nAccusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the board neither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight\nAnd he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test and he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nIt further claimed the Ford never voice any fear of flying even all aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look these are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said there were four people that could corroborate her story none of them couldn't corroborate her story most don't remember\nAny party like this and the one eye witness a cheap place in the room at the time of the alleged assault that it didn't happen\nSo at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement\nAnd assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to answer the same questions\nIf they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told her story multiple times and\nI got to believe and assume that they're\nThey're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week\nBefore the Senate Judiciary committee\nUm you know it's just I just this there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters\nYou know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter Lindsey Graham is saying Clinton sec accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor

impeach the president they want to investigate all things president what do you think the Fifteen page expos they in the New York times is all about number one\nThey they figure it out the Kavanaugh

guys name as ... D predicted\nIt twenty sixteen that the Trump presidency would lead lead to an economic disaster he's now saying as rip roaring hot it was on CNBC\nSo that's the eight years of Obama you want to go back to that are we better off as a country than we were two years ago do you want the agenda 'cause it's not about you\nIt's not about your family's it's not about your kids it's not about the future

elderly man getting in his face in an airport\nThat's what they they're telling people to do Spartacus has been saying at Maxine Waters is saying it\nIt by the way Obama has said many times over the years even directly aimed at me but they want to impeach the president if Kavanaugh gets through and they want to impeach him\nEndless investigation Trump Trump Organization Trump's taxes Trump this

lost their doctor their plans they're paying three four times more in some states and its bankrupting now\nIn two years because we got the largest tax cuts in history in two years because we got rid of\nMore burdensome regulation and the last five or six presidents combined in terms of the the the burdens that we'd plates on business business has been leaving the country even Obama recognized jobs is they're not coming back\nWell they're not coming back for you because they can't make any money with you being president that's what it in an advise companies to leave their home country and set up shop in places like Mexico and and other places abroad\nNow the president has been set of eyes all these companies to come back and they're investing trillions and when they said that oh he's going to start a trade war with Mexico and Canada\nWell now we got a significantly better deal than we had before which means oh auto parts are going to be made by American workers with the minimum wage was sixteen dollars an hour\nOh and a half to help American dairy farmers a poultry farmers um that's all jobs for the for the you know look in the states that had suffered the most of\nThe the

all they're talking about destroying Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance\nThey're talking about bankrupting the country and I think that we just have to go out and wager campaign and I must say President Trump is doing as good a job I'm getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen\nAnd I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his discussion but what do they just saw happened the cabin all his is committed to a work ethic and do it to a better

those promises really liked it\nPersonal integrity has been called into question and that prompted the integrity of the court will be called into question if he is confirmed until I thought it was a temper tantrum he wanted to angry and belligerent and it was kind of scary than worrying that\nWhite people are going to lose all their power so that in downtown and she's lying when she's not lying or he's lying state jobs want to hold onto this how soon will the like South Africa apartheid with ten times had a white people were running the country\nI don't know what you do about\nHe said I drank there are like there are like enough already when they enough on a on a\nVote against it I really don't care if a terror rifle not good enough sexual predator is not good enough or maybe in temperament maybe that's why we get maybe a lot about how much he drank and I'd go and maybe two eyes in a bar in New York\nEnough above don't destroy this man's life goes around comes around\nIn that statement rates went and they said she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge spike punch at parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she thought either man's spike it\nAnd you see Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know spiking punch in her life and I I saw him given rent solo cups a quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch\nBowl or the punch container it's I don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends to remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers hurricane season\nAnd we have we haven't heard from a friend so I'm asking you know are there people alive today I ... I yeah I had to address part anyway yeah there are people that know about that part and he's\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of French she says went to the parties with her one of them said he did not recall a Julie sweat Nick another of the friends she named the siege we've reached out to the other two and haven't turned back\nSo if you cannot get a single person given to you named given to you that would corroborate their story\nTo actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing not not in significant fact for the most significant back\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend bases and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drug and boys lined up the hall is just so they can gang rape exam ...\nWell I'm he gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party you don't know if he did anything to the punch\nI'm just so wreck was irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this\nIs beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation if they had witnesses if there wasn't a changing shifting story if there was a dramatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want\nWhich is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other there are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever in drug rape or girl are evil deeds and people are\nPredators they need to get off our streets but you gotta have some core operation to these things\nAnd it just comes out well Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh\nAnd if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process\nAnd simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by accusations because in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case\nWhat you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning but no evidence\nYou know in every single one of these cases they're shifting narratives and stories Kaylee Macedonia\nIs with us author of uh the new American Revolution the making of a populist movement Jeffrey Lord former associate political director in the Reagan Administration he wrote the book awhile ago way before anyone else picked up on it what America needs the case with Donald Trump\nOr think Jeffrey thirty four days out of a midterm election which historically has not worked out well for the\nThe party in power in the White House um I Do believe there has been an energizing\nA across the country or uniting uh if you will of pretty much anyone that his conservative fair minded Republicans even never Trump or is that they recognize what is going on here and I think they're all pretty angry and pissed off\nI think that's right so and I've talked to people I mean people are living and I do mean live at about the treatment of judge Kavanaugh um yesterday I saw I think it was a Quinnipiac poll\nThat uh the the generic democratic both had already dropped five point um because of this nonsense this is a Lynch mob plain and simple and and let's be\nCrystal clear here you're President Trump not gotten nominated gotten so for the Supreme Court they would find a reason to do this kind of thing and it doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh dropped out Kamara which thank God he's not going to\nAnd they substitute somebody else some version of this is going to happen again and again and again because at the end it's all about Robie way it's all about the idea that they get to run the country from the Supreme Court instead of the Congress and that's what it's all about\nWhy when I get is I I Do believe that after the the shock of November twenty sixteen I think that there's been a collective melt down by people on the left and their and their outrage and their hatred in their ...\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can you discuss I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every Democrat\nI I don't I don't think so because it sort of like what Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this with the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and wears Jeff snowflake going to vote\nEt cetera and it comes down to three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing forward to going to do that here in ... ... ... and I think Democrats\nYou're exactly right that's what it then it gets on a week ago if we what if like common for how quick San ... team here that we might not airing when he and and I said I'm not because I had any pay the Democrat because they are populations in mind you have your mansion looking at it for\nLike thirty percent margin that people are getting out what the ... from five thirty percent marketing the people of North Dakota once you have an office park it would be political suicide or hiking or math or die I don't do not vote\nFor the nominee don't don't do that because there are lapdog but they might do it out of their own political South Africa\nThat through factory right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mansion but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins\nAnd Murkowski or a combination of of colon than and\nFlake or or Murkowski in like\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their constituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the euro with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden\nOf having to face the horrible voters they get I mean I was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I I mean don't\nGet real goes wrong principle is man that stands on values\nThis this is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater conscious of the conservative and it you know if he is now we're in a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first of all just like Jeff\n... delusion that you are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime\nAll right out of your thank you both for being with us he couldn't get ... votes I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state racing off to the north east New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and and the owner nobody's interested in the guy that says no I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again oh so every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were involved in a particular vote\nRight quick break we'll come back

have now we examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there were so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever air that interview but there anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned\nHis dad one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating I throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think what has to happen with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her or structure of a congressional proceedings by submitted false after David and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it\nHas to be done in order to send a signal to everybody out there\nYou cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself a publicity is very very important that Mitt sweating it\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substitute issues permits Ramirez story\nAnd I just wanted to say something that I Know\nA problem with Sean you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied like her lawyers did not however that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers didn't tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nOh I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment\nWhen professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham or or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I Know there was genuine surprise remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a\nRadical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is separate hatched ever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal I wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace\nAnd also defended and in the case of Al Franken but I ... I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes\nWell ... I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know what else\nShould they should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy you except that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense an effective in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety\nNow why what's her story not include are going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if what she says occurred and if she had gone to those people get why they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave\nThe house I don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape and it's an people there are people that will drug and rape people\nI eat look at the bill Cosby case we know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now I pushed this so far into a into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume it's probably people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying beat by allowing\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that he believed everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborate and conveniently enough\nEvery things that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rumble it's nonexistent there is nothing happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them there's another problem with her story listen she said that they\nThey're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up\nSo nobody could hear her and then she likes to soften the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys and just turn the music apps and no one could hear ... went over and then said let's turn it down\nThere so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe

of professor Ford no location how did she get to and from the where the alleged ... event took place misconduct allegations et cetera et cetera um\nRemember no corroborating evidence no location there is no forensic evidence there's no on the backs up or claim the people but she identified up this\nAt this house where the alleged incident happened nobody corroborate that the one I witnessed she
