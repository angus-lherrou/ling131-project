Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it with the Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia and Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space\nTime anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the ... state were incredible footage has been shot on UFOs where close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have a course continued now going around and taking measurements try and see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with you George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way of very cool that you played a a a group from Asheville North Carolina's great group or you know ... my home town for our listeners and may not know\nAnd ah you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting the player an Ashville group but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you and the audience\nThat I think perhaps helps you put my discovery in context okay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid as all this just coincidence\nOr are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a being slowly revealed or expose however you want to you\nAnd of course I never believed it once in a ...\nWell you and I have that uncommon for sure I agree entirely you believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does your new so All right let's start\nWith the number of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally about that that they were working on this thing back engineering UFO to breathe in the state of Nevada uh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called eight\nTo that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media but it was not in it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there were plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was where it's headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada\nTo keep that in mind uh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen up this year in early June NAFTA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I\nDiscovered that time warp which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and then use it\nThat night your as I Would then my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of desert I turn on the news and saw the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space for\nYou know what did he really mean by you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at\nThe time when you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions were related to run as well and I'm In you know the the whole suspicion that surrounds

want to call 'em visitors the new column are just as easily invaders but there may be some some uh being\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against and they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely um\nAnything that we can do and so once we see the possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little

dome in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles\nGo ahead you're with us no\nHe's not let's get John in Virginia Beach Virginia tried hey John go ahead\nGeorge ... um I wouldn't tell your story that happy they back in the nineties now I Am I never believed in those spirits\nUFOs eighties anything's ... however back in Nineteen majors middle nineties I hadn't had passed away and they were having a memorial service blaming the church and I was in that close to the way but I just sat in\nAny way I I went I was late getting as so I had a knack for the treacherous pack\nAnd uh the service is going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the church and I looked up and it was my uncle they just passed a label and and he told me he said John don't drive your car\nAnd I wish I would hate us editor what to do and then again he said jak don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up very late and what he's gone you live near\nBut still I was a new assembly\nAnd so I got a rabbit on our friend of mine and the next morning\nI called my cousin which was the son named it that way and asking the TV Land bringing my car to me and I'd get him right back home and not at all so he and his go up and got my car and the kids learn them for ... anyway he um it would drive my\nCar when they pulled out the parking lot and they were hit my truck oh and and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know injured on her I mean they had Logan bones and oh man I took a while but\nI never told anybody this or that I was re elected to say anything that it was a dead till two of my close friends and um other leg way than not that I Would show that happen in a a a dish and up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the warning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know what I didn't want to do that after he told me down and it's\nWhat you didn't think it would carry on to them\nNo no no that doesn't have any idea they daily be injured in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a ... that's the only time I have encountered anything like a safe scale which goes you get the same thing as for cars than their senior\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know drawing\nThank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm\nYou know scientists who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time life that the past the president and the future are all happening of what\nThe problem is that we humans are spirits in the material world it's like the song by the police and\nSo when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the president\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed and the spiritual realm that person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the\nPerspective of enhance the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nThough anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover\nMight definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see someone into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh you know Robert at this point lives like a king and ... and this is very funny\nBecause he still down in Florida\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think are really became famous or some would say infamous ads for Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and um I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and gets article II of releasing their pent up frustrations\nOn him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck ... started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay\nThis call here a you know Robert was fighting back yeah and\nIt's the cause of that that uh he I Believe now it's a\nFamous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in part\nTo people like usual words you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and almost ten years ago and to do live reports and to really dig into this and I don't you may or may not recall George I actually called into the shows\nI remind you live it was just me and Robert and the whole place just the two of them was creepy\nYes it is great [laughter] dollar let me just anybody who's ever seen robbers at all just to look him up you know on the just type in Robert that all Google and you know you can see he's a creepy looking guy from the moment I got there I was respectful\nI asked his permission if you go to my website you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert The Honda doll and I said look I'm Joshua pie Warren\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert guy got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably and\nHelping to educate people that there is something bad happens you if you're disrespectful to the stall and if you're nice of the dog then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the dog was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the dog like in the window we're running back and forth some weird stuff like

became obsessed with this call when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very you know successful man\nUh had had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change is infatuation with adult I mean you might think back when you were a kid and maybe there was some toy that was special to you and there came a point when it just for the drifted away that never happened\nFor gene auto he kept this\nThis uh dolled till the end of his wife and treated in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better that he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room so\nUh is room was a an eventually moved to the attic at at the wife insistence but you know they claimed that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house that there are banned and for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the

talk about haunted World War two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigator what was that one catalysts that got you into\nOddly enough George ... it was really an incident that happened before\nI was born really um yeah 'cause I I come from a large family\nAh my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while mantle both both sides of my family they've been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds\nOr but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back that her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties a name Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these\nVery strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet\nHas them visible built around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that reminds you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that at ... again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nInsurance don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color\nAnd everybody is becoming very best is um it's a great reflection of that original\nCelebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent\nCame into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that\nThe very first him at an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Rowan Oak island and they all manner so we now know that today is one of his Greatest Mystery of the law calling me\nAnd so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure\nContributed to the fact that I Love this time of year thirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua Warren dot com is no period after the Joshua would be one

researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had real long term potential he bought it\nIn right now he's looking for people to help him turn this company into his next billion dollar success story\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars okay and and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on things as opposed to regular\nThat that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music\nThere was there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research\nThe world war two goes for 'em and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material\nAnd I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines uh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and you know\nAll of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different\nWhen I started to research hunted World War two\nWas that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm a history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and they're trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nOr you know I've been I've never looked for whether a a ... or was available to German troops in Norman during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details\nSo I think those are two reasons why these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance\nThe stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went through a little bit more aware custard less than one\nAnd he's convinced that sponsor to Gettysburg Reno was on the right sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war that creates these auntie visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're\nEssentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists and they said that this him in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these hum\nIt almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual on eggs now on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that you know\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that\nBecause these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about the death and the tragedy\nThat it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so hard to\nLose their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\nI think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely\nHaunted um there's\nJust doesn't ... stories are especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists are documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting\nWas that a a father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter\nVisited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter in law and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later the daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures\nAre these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff immediately recognize these uniforms is German uniforms and\nLater he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of\nWeaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because\nShe was so young but then she began to describe the guns\nThat were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched\nOr what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they had these experiences\nAre in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers the other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and uh his name's Tom put do\nAnd he told me that uh he investigated the our dense battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany\nA and a site of the battle of the bulge\nAnd ah he claims to have encountered a lot of weird activity there and he considers that area one of the most haunted places\nIn Europe he also said that uh the concentration camps are extremely haunted but out of honor and respect for those\nThe dead there he refuses to investigate he's just heard a lot of stories and likewise I decided to leave any stories about the concentration camps ... out of my book too\nYoung to emotional yeah too much what would you say your some of the most dramatic stories that you've put the some of the most dramatic story I mean every chapters Reuben I gotta say\nOh I appreciate that the one that moves me the most I found toward the stories that happened uh\nUh in the Pacific theater and again when you're talking about World War two you're talking about a global conflicts so these\nGhost stories crop up literally everywhere yeah\nA ... in Okinawa was that was the one story that stood out for me a and there's a story about a group of civilians who are committed suicide or en masse or right after the the American invasion of Okinawa and just a\nLittle like heaven's gate or something like that\nIt wasn't exactly like that or the story is uh that the Japanese military knew that\n... what was kind of the last fortress they had a ... in the Pacific if the Americans took over al ... Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring a most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers\nSo what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and\nYou know God Knows what else the civilians are enslave them scare the living daylights right absolutely\nTerrified to when the Americans did invade the civilians were would run off the cliff to commit suicide and that's you know that's a documented piece of history just a terrifying uh a story but\nNow there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a group of tourists were had a peace museum near those cliffs and they were walking in a field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they consider to they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a win this past\nThem and then later heard what they described as cries and screams\nSo that was pretty moving for me uh another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um heartbreaking and\nIn less than two minutes no needles no pay just the happier\nYounger looking you it's simple to use big or small drop lightly applied to target area leave them until dry then apply cosmetic if necessary it's great for men and women people are amazed at how fast at work here at some reaction with actual instantly a few others\nI've probably noticed in the past five years that my I have seen a lot of fine line wrinkles make ... have gotten fever while I was hoping for five years but I think about my head was like ten years ago that that's\nReally cool wrinkle gone [laughter] it's easy to put it on your finger and go I Wish I had more down here because I can still see one record bugging me I Am a little bit emotional turning forty I didn't think would be a big deal to me but that looked like the me that I feel like inside instead of what\nInstantly age live today go to our exclusive website H.

ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits those planes that strange ... cities\nPearl Harbor is it haunted or not\nIt's a extremely haunted or according to a lot of the people that go there and uh many of the people tourists\nPeople who are interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave 'em and it'll tell you would have a moving experiences\nAnd again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself\nInto the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that have been told about that a a famous area are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona\nA just briefly and then a during that time where he left the ship it was attacked us and sunk and now there's the story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out\nInto the bay where the Arizona in an hour is uh so that\nGoes story has been told\nA quite a bit of um [noise] excuse me ... there's also a story of a level of\nOne lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces\nIn the ... into the picture is very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and goes stories that places like the show field barracks and hit them airbase\nThat were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved uh\nThe C Q desk which is usually inside the building they say now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of\nPeople running up and down steps to such a degree that the the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the uh the Nazi pens or tank leader had some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm what what are the he's still haunts\nWell that's probably the most interesting\nA story that I found a\nA when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could find that the ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the axis powers or an Erwin ... has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected uh the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor um\nThere's a lot of activity or\nA witness there a shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and ed stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a\nShip base a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on their uh and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all those are and there are there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are\nA lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening\nSeem to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy for some reason tragedy makes these goals or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a a interaction between costs\nReality or maybe that were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nIn our special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic to\nMe I Love them that one of my favorite\nThey just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now with prince and folks like that have they come back to a ... as a ghost ...\nWell there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few\nA video anomalies\nWhen a ... when I Believe his brother I Believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they so Michael Jackson walk behind him\nThere are stories from a neighbor's of a former home owned by Michael Jackson the claim to hear music coming out of it at odd times when there shouldn't be anybody at home so\nDefinitely a Michael Jackson has been seen there

bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll telling me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is\nThat I really when I started writing Hi rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah and ah\nYou know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special coal power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll when it comes a I came away with is the thought that music is really just to consciousness raising\nToll or it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of a historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open\nTo things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote\nThese these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of this book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded a having shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\nYeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of these stories and these tales of the supernatural usually start out fan to fan musician to music\nIn a person the witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate all look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they sold the parts and apparently they were haunted\nYeah that's a ... and the name of his car yeah he um he had a car was a poor spider or was involved in Iraq and then a pieces of it because it was really a race car a pieces of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about um\nA a one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on him and I think crushed him to death believe it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four the crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered are that are now in the national I think air force\nA museum or and pieces of that plane were reported to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces with went into a a a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on it so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls here for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood Marilyn to get us started Hey Frank\nHow did your glad to be back with you or when you made any subject India\nI I I I think they had to be some hard things at the uh uh and not the Nazi Germany but what about a remote places where the Jewish people were murdered by by not a\nI once saw a film where they were just shut down three hundred just shot down over a ditch and they were wanting to get that they were jot down a credible what was found\nAnd I'm Wondering if you've been any innate hunting and in a\nRemote places are or where you're not you're not take my answer off air no case\n... thanks for that that's a that's a great question and I believe I Know exactly which which footage you're talking about and believe it or not one of the stories that I came across a\nIs I think from that area because I I Believe it that might have been taken in Poland Czechoslovakia\nAnd there are stories about some of the victims of the Jewish victims of those atrocities\nUm that still hunt those areas again I I I found out of a difference for those those people are that I Would leave them out of the book and and wouldn't try to uh try to um you know they looked at like I was making any money from that so I I left that out but yeah definitely those stories\nCrop up and I guarantee you if you were in those areas you would find a lot of go slower a lot of folklore and a lot of good stories about those places\nNext up we go to Charles ... Charles go ahead\nEither yeah well I was a door at the uh me and my dad were uh uh right and I was riding along and the pickup truck over in er at an article in over here in Texas we saw a\nIt had all the qualities of a goat plane I would've never of World War two go away and I ... I\nDidn't think about it necessarily at the time it was sort of strange\nTo look real to you at the time\nYeah I looked it looked real except that it that one thing and I had my windows down you ride around without or with the windows down and pick up and the and it was totally it was like fire with why I think I could almost like that on top of the the pick up I've got get taught\nWell now that's interesting ... ... ... people see these planes or the physical enough where you can't touch it\nYeah I mean the the callers account is almost identical to what some of the people\nAre experienced in England where the the plane looks real it doesn't look like it's you know wonder woman's invisible plane coming over where you can just see outline to it looks like a real plane but as he describes it you could you know the one couple said that they could almost touch it it was so close\nAnd they also said there for such a big plane there was no noise or very little to uh yeah very interesting\nWhat about the new people never she uh pilots in these planes\nI haven't ever I have not come across any um\nStories about actually seeing the pilot that I that I recall so I I don't know about that\nThe fact that these supernatural events occur during the wars after the war is is there a message\nBehind them and there could be I mean the message for me is that um these these uh whatever happened in those areas that\nAre at least the history has to live on that to me seems to be the main message whether it's go slower ghost stories that something important happened in something needs to be preserved I that's kind of my own personal philosophy of it\nWe have Eric in Illinois Welcome to the show Hi Eric Europe with us do change their mind controlled guy as everybody everybody's\nFine he's a regular caller Matt don't worry don't be scared of\nSeven years ago I was a listening to an audio and there's a video by the same name or on the Apollo Project\nAnd one of the things I remember uh hearing on the audio version that said when mercury seven astronauts astronaut Deeks slight and died almost at the same time his plane was seen on the other side of the country like a ghost planes taking off\nAnd I didn't know the a guest that ever heard of that story for\nYou know this is this is one\nAnd something needs to be preserved I that's kind of my own personal philosophy of it\nWe have Eric in Illinois Welcome to the show Hi Eric Europe with us today there has to mind control guy as everybody\nEverybody's fine he's a regular caller about don't worry don't

callers they all blow me away with with their stories\nI think I heard about that that goes story I think I read an account of that but I I Can't be entirely certain\nMatthew since you've been doing these stories do new stories come to you all the time now\nI Do get a lot of news stories I get a lot of emails or when I'm when I'm On shows like this people will a message me off line and and give me ... leads\nA basically how I started with a moron and rock and roll a was a just getting people sending me their own accounts because it's hard to again when we talked about if\nThese these stories tend to be more or old there between people and they don't go on line so your it's almost like I have like\nTens of thousands of reporters out there bringing stuff to me and I I assume the same thing

California is with us I'm Monique\nHi Phil earth or were you know high of ... thank you so much for having me on the show\nUh have you ever heard of Marilyn Monroe coming back as a theory if I have a short story I was in a play about her in West Hollywood former theater which within a structure that I Believe it or at work here in Nineteen forty three and\nOne particular night wind up man\nWhich can relate about to leave and he thought he saw the hair on stage\nAnd she said oh probably what are you doing here and then she realized that she thought she was actually a theme here and have Marilyn Monroe away the women needed and white she sat\nOn it now he's ever had something like that\nWas that you know actually that's kind of a fascinating a chapter that I didn't include\nA in haunted World War two and maybe I should of his really some of the stories around a famous people who were maybe not involved in the actual fighting of the war but were involved in the war effort and I'm thinking about actresses\nI've never written anything about uh the ghosts of I'm\nMarilyn Monroe but I Know that when I was researching haunted rock and roll I Believe that her name came up in one of the places where Elvis\n...\n\nI'm a girl or\nI\nWas in\n[noise]\n\nIt was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case and\nSpeak with mark hammer senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report um ... the wage issue remain a mystery or we\nJust kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously\nYeah uh well for one that's of average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nAh and nothing is probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I fit as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWith it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so [noise]\nUm for the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer would have has to be asked by people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go of the you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend up or the other words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years\nOr does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and all that so the answer though comes after the fact ah but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impacts of the tax cut begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably twenty twenty as a day to watch when that happens to coincide ironically or perhaps not what

with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nI as we know from twenty sixteen and past election tend not to show up uh in numbers proportionate to their share of the population particularly in midterm elections we're in turn out a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so uh the ... campaign and then\nTexas Democrats think a very rural have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did and to have made for similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters are non college educated white voters and try sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence or the or go to the show that that's going to be the case and\nIt was the interesting a data deep dive either because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nWe tend to be a little more Republican than facts on the country I think in twenty sixteen it was a snack thirty four

and so that the general elections have been a cakewalk for one party or the other and\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add onto that there really hasn't been a competitive\nStatewide race

draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters to not to vote for the reluctant to vote is up for a presumption that a Democrat can win what were what does that come from\nJust no I mean if you're a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's come and ask for a vote a and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having limited all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and he'd been detected in the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the counties that\n... that I Would uh been in Texas twice this year to visit him or his campaigning and I in February when I was down there he was building counties a and having more people show up to his to see him then voted in the twenty sixteen election in those counties are and so\nHe thinks that he's able to draw\nA people out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason for them to participate before because Texas has been so Republican or one of the things that he says on the campaign trail that he doesn't believe the Texas with a red state but it's a non voting staked a and he can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is by his house district in El Paso or hasn't voted much either so there's not\nWhile he is certainly been very compelling on the um campaign trail is drawn enormous\nNumbers of people ah the evidence that he can get

and do the right thing and have courage that we can get to the right outcome and the second lesson is that\nAnd looking back over the past month this is an experience that the American people should never be drugs through and should never be done to any person again as what was it was done to judge now justice Cavanaugh\nI Would I Would agree with you uh one of the things that I think that we might keep in mind and that is that if someone suffers a sexual assault that is a terrible thing one can hope that as the person who did that is a brought to justice is try if convicted is sufficiently punished\nAnd I am prepared to bend over backwards offering all kinds of ah a consolation and ah and sympathy to such people however\nWhen such person then goes in the direction\nOf accusing someone else without having done this I'm afraid the standard has to be considerably higher namely you've got to have some kind of goods to actually offer you've got to be able to be specific\nTo offer the kinds of things that get in fact lead to a credible accusation otherwise it's not enough to say that I was one sexually assaulted and let's pick some guy whoever's handy because any will do because they're all pigs that doesn't cut it\nWe were so close and this to setting a new standard that\nThe accusation is the conviction itself and we saw that start to snowball when you started to have the completely absurd accusations on us but none of us lay\nA alleged against justice Kavanaugh after the first couple of allegations began to to gain traction and\nIt quickly spiraled out of control I think to the Senate Judiciary committee should be commended as chairman Grassley at bringing this back to a disciplined focused process that gave a fair opportunity for\nCredible

well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a\nHall maybe not lined up in a hall um which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out the week before I mean you go if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell they're getting a say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding Dr Ford there were nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't warrant interviewed it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't you don't count the witnesses\nAnd but I think some of those other people as I say now are going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know and the and the fame and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no pro into their no criminal cases are no civil cases a good man was confirmed he's now justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very UBS\nUp to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official war to confirm that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the O. J. and the FBI to go after Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean ...\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nWell that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there was a Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton\nRussia collusion she had on her payroll or British spy a who is using the Russian sources and now we've learned a through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer they\nDocuments were being passed to him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the DNC ... lawyer\nA show and you know this is astonishing information or and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated and federal regulations are very clear you may not should meant the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated in yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are deep classified and the inspector general has a has had enough time to\nLook at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who's the eye and the fourth buys a warrant you know the bases in bulk of the information in the by the application\nJohn was the unverified are uncorroborated dot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those and I mean nothing he has to be held accountable for that\nWell let's wait and see when the documents are declassified but the answer to your question is of course uh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about\nShould be thoroughly investigated but I think it separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation\nCan conclude by showing independently that the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing and it doesn't have to be one or they did not necessarily linked\nWould they would he have an obligation\nTo do this is what frustrates me I think that the the mandate was so broad that we end up going into people's you know main bank loan applications from years gone by to me is just ridiculous the considering where it was supposed to start and where it was supposed to go\nUp what is it not lead to an important issue especially of Russian lives were paid for and disseminated to the American people the purposely lied to them before an

three times only vote picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack could die of number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what the literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better\nAmericans enemies and we'd better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right now\nWe're we have to take very seriously this concept of the left\nOr the left has been taken over by the radical thinking about the fact that JFK would not be

J. FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia debt added the D and\nSee ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting a phone call from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lives and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the\nYou know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh and this was first happened in August so you found out pretty early yeah and actually I just I first started getting the phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just\nGot a call tell you that they had the spies a war against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of oil and the first five to ... I think first\nRan with the story in March of ... Seventeen yes and that's when we said wait a minute there's a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\nIt it's funny Sean rage hey interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they did they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're\nEver going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged break\nI absolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and again the primary focus of those conversations about the dodgy ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to\nThe ... about that did they ask you specifics about that dogs yeah absolutely yeah and basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of revolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of or or you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nRight let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and the um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties there's got to be some records for you well I'd\nDefinitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMight the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that\nYou should write a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know something about I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like I guess maybe there were some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing at the time basically yeah and you know going back many years again at\nAnd we had talked about how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total\nOver the last two years or the last two decades two years that's two years well I mean in terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours\nI had to do in terms of documents production etcetera right now that's a whole different level when you went before a mall or what was that like\nYou know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they have been a less leaky\nIn terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and\nI won't I don't remember that night but I won't even I back at all that's going on you have a you know\nAnd as the ... now it's not asking you questions one of the last time you got a\nCall from anybody I haven't uh I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen I'm at all the whole year and it's like a year's worth of freedom\nWell you know it's I'm not worried about freedom for me I'm worried about freedom for our country and freedom from the fake news you know I watched what happened to judge Kavanaugh it's just a complete replay of this exact same DNC smear tactics so you think\nThat there will always be a cloud of suspicion hovering over your head because of those\nI talked with someone you know a top law professor a earlier this year and he said well there's always going to be thirty to forty percent of the country that has never believe you and completely have you\nGot to take a break we'll come back more with Carter Page on the other side than your calls coming a final half hour eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the ...\nDo you want them rewarding because this is who they are this is what defines up they're not they're not the party of due process than not the party of the presumption of innocence they're the party of bludgeon\nFirst and win at all costs that's what that's what the snake now I Know it's hard to get people motivator for midterm elections well I Hope this wakes you up I Hope those motivate you I Hope you know the stakes are high I Hope you know there's a lot in play here\nNow we now Harry yet another into tissues and I'm ... and the kind of trying to frame ... Supreme\nCourt is heading into a crisis of legitimacy and uh and when when not if when judge Kavanaugh helps them to chip away at civil rights voting rights women's rights and abortion rights or I don't think it's a very well with the country he promised that he'd be a hard core parts in and he will be that the one thing he didn't lie about under oath\nThat the edge to survivor and Dr for him why we don't want to hear from you too if we have to hear from you were forced to read it so that there are no see I think I said that's\nNot forgive me if people would go to church and then go to the limit to have the clothing themselves morality and that's what we're seeing today\nOr let's get to let's say Hi to Dan is in Charleston Dan Hi how are you glad you called sir\nI'm doing great Sean thanks for taking my call hey thank you how\nThe uh the the O. J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hiking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as a bunch of places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because three of those guys were named in Miller's indictment\nSo I'm Wondering how it is they can have been doing I don't think there's any doubt that there's no doubt at all that\n... in the hospital regime of Russia being him being the hospital actor that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos and the United states and the constantly sigh cyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something the very few people will tell you and that is at some point\nWe've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nNow much intellectual property is stolen his billions and billions of dollars from Americans say ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known\nOf Julian Assange is wanted in his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D\nThat's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way the fact that\nWe have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we haven't hire the best people who designed the systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what are your\nRight I I think you're right about the other one one question that I come up with with with this uh the OJ indictment is\nThey were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is the smaller can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the you know Jay has very detailed information on I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty you\nKnow it didn't it damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never paid the trial\nI don't doubt that this is happening as a matter of fact it was seven newness warned everybody what happened in twenty sixteen\nNow every other studies have shown that it has an impact that the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have the vulnerability is at some point it becomes our problem in our fault\nThe fact that Hillary you know we we don't have any doubt that foreign services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously\nUm and it you know look at your own personal that's why I tell everybody get light block dot com\nIt'll call one eight hundred life lost their ... their literally robbing people blonde wind every day the cyber criminals are good at what they do\nAll right let's get back to our phones Dan thank you appreciate it let's say Hi to guy is Marilyn guy

mean Sean I'm totally confused by the way that you can tell I mean it doesn't want to go crazy I mean I can understand the guys get to ...\nI I I honestly believe that Donald Trump or to cure cancer his enemies still would have to if he if he adopted they're dumb policies and was their biggest advocate for and they still have to have you gave every American and everybody in the world a million dollars they still have them they can't help but it's out\nAnd Sean I said that way before you ever said that I originally said if you get out of your million dollars they complain why isn't the tumor
