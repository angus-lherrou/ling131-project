polls misleading election forecasters in underestimating Trump's support no they were correctly measuring democratic support for Hillary Clinton what they didn't know is that those democratic votes wouldn't be counted because they wouldn't be giving provisional ballots\nIt goes on to say it didn't help us some polls were tired of news organizations that didn't don't really have resources to support the work it was you know quack quack quack and so they're trying to figure out how to get better poll she never going to get better poles when when people think that they voted and come out and tell your pollsters yeah I voted\nI mean\nYou know and and it gets report and you know well here's how many people said they voted for Al Gore I mean in Florida and two thousand I don't know why ah it shows this this Seventy thousand fewer people actually voted for him because they were thrown off the voting rolls they voted provisional ballots\nAnd it's incredible Dionne in Joplin, Missouri ID on what's on your mind that\n[noise] yeah I heard your ah your discussion on crystal knocked and I thought that was fantastic I think we really need to conceptualize everything that's going on right now but\nMy my question and and my real problem is how\nDo we get people who don't believe in facts to understand facts or more importantly the people that are apathetic and just don't know not that they don't care or just that they just don't know how do we get them to see what's going on in historical context in and really be as concerned as I think people should be\nWell the red eye open the show with will be up on YouTube and a few hours or as a standalone YouTube clip and uh you know You're welcome to to share it with as many friends as you want a the most of what I was reading from was at the at history dot org or their page on crystal mocked\nAnd uh you you share that with people or you know the the the simple fact of the matter is that while there is a good chunk of anti Semitism in Trump and his white supremacists and when you're ... you know the last time I talked to David Duke on this program and I\nI won't have him back any more as a as a consequence of how he responded um every thing I tried to discuss with him he turned into a you know well how many Jews run Hollywood you know these kind of these kind of a question really really rose anti Semitic questions\nAnd ah you know tried to turn the tables on it [noise] so but my point is that there's a big chunk of anti Semitism in here but it wasn't just the Jews that Hitler was going after and just like it's not just the Jews the Trump is going after he's going after\nNow there are not people of color in it in Nazi Germany at the time now you've got the Turks in Germany who were brought in after the war to rebuild the country there they were called the guest workers gassed are fighters as the German word for that\nAnd now sometimes two three four generations down many of them still don't have German citizenship and there's a whole issue around us and\nA lot of the rage of the modern day Nazis in Germany and I'm Talking to literally the people who are and and the and the and the hard right a party political party in Germany the just acquired some seats in parliament is against the Turks it's not against the Jews because they've got no Jews what\nWell where very few but what's happening here is it's against Hispanics and it's against African Americans\nAnd it's against Jews it's a it's a three for and I'm I'm telling ya de on\nAfrican Americans know what's going on they know what I'm Talking about Hispanics are quickly figuring out what's going on and what I'm Talking about and the one one problem might be that many many recent visitors to the United states or or resident as Citizens United states who are Hispanic\nOr listen to Spanish language media or watched Spanish language television and I don't know how this is being played out there but I think that the only thing that we can do is spread the word is far and wide as possible\nAnd not and not allow this both sides is um you know this this crap that you hear from time to time well you know there are radicals in the Democratic party really uh you know well you know it's like a Newt Gingrich said yesterday\nOr you mean like when when uh Eric Holder said when the Republicans are down you should kick them owner was very you know he made a very clear he was talking metaphorically he was saying that you know when when\nWhen the when the Democrats are when the Republicans go low you kick back you fight back that's what he was saying and and you know Maxine Waters and Dionne thank you for the call Maxine Waters comment that you know a out and people in public I think that that was wildly exaggerated and taken out of context and to the extent that\nIt wasn't she's walked it back or apologize for but but it doesn't matter\nThe real reason that these guys are going after Maxine Waters is easy to find\nAnd why why it's being supported by the billionaires behind them and in fact I I I printed this whole thing out here today\nAnd I just don't know where west but it's a over at the website\nIs the U.S house committee on financial services Democrats\nAnd southern Democrats dash financial services that has done of and you go to their to the main page\nAnd there's these ... you go to Maxine Waters pay she's the ranking member she she will run this committee of the Democratic as represented as you go to her page and you look at the articles that she has published in the last year as the number to\nCongress person running the house committee on financial services\nOr you just you just look at the titles of her articles and I will read them to you this is from financial services that in front of a Democrat stash financial services that house dot Gov dams offer a resolution establish in wealth gap as a national problem\nNow how do you think the billionaires like Mercer and Cokes and eight or something like that and yelling herring wires Sikhs answers at the wealth gap another article another article financial services Democrats challenge Republican views on any quality issues\nAnother article waters are says GOP budget ignores inequality and the racial wealth gap in America\nAnother one waters Maxine Waters calls for a focus on promoting growth and reducing income inequality in the United states another one waters this guy is growing\nIt's I just wanted to point that out and also with a pack that was something with Tom DeLay of Texas who worked very hard to combine some people to try to get money out of the American Israeli political action committee and I was there when I saw it happen\nTo the Republican Party absolutely it was a concentrated for by Tom DeLay to do it he focused on it he made it a daily chores to do that\nAnd you were there and you saw it I was there I was in the room I heard it all wrecked thank you so what's going on in the world\nWell of course the situation with the the horrible situation with the ah the bombs that have been set they seem to be at this point in time at least a you know they are not um sophisticated but they seem to be from\nAt least the same person or the same group or because they are dangerous but not sophisticated or than\nPeople that you know I've talked to some people that are sort of bomb experts on this show is nothing coming from the government but they seem to believe that they will be able to track down uh whoever person or again groups\nThat were involved in this just become a horrific situation of course yeah and the president I made a you know a conciliatory statement but then he went to was concert last night and went right back\nThe national media a badgering and rushing to heat the media yesterday to debt or the other thing is that the have you talked about the president's a cell phone yet today\n[noise] no I have not okay for this one is I mean this is amazing\nThe Lenny ... just to put this in context\n... what the Republicans spent years harassing Hillary Clinton over and trying to prosecute her foreign millions of dollars trying to prosecutor for was using a private email server in her home\nOr to conduct government business when she was ... state which turns out she didn't do but she didn't use it for you know private stuff but uh and the whole thing was you know that server isn't secure it doesn't have a government level security it could be hacked and therefore we should lock her up\nIt never won acted turns out but we should like rocket and could have been hacked now to Mr Trump\nWhy I I was going to make that conclusion to make that parallel because of all that was sad but there is also a part of this that is\nHumorous but it's sad um\nAnd it was a defense and the story and I'll get to that President Obama when he became president he loved his blackberry we all knew that he wanted to keep it they said you can't and he didn't he turned over his blackberry well President Trump we find out did not turn over years two phones ones the quote government vote and the other is just personal Tony didn't turn it over he has used it\nOr they are saying uh categorically point blank the Chinese have listened in and not for secrets but they have listened in to try to understand him have psychiatrists psychologists look at it to try to see how they can manipulate him how they can ... him ... which is very fascinating\nRight there and they're probably teaching president she had a ... toward Trump's away Sean Hannity does every night when they have their conversation about why that maybe the here's how to get him to be your best friend\nSean Hannity to do it so that part of this is actually in the story that is amazing calm is when the story says there wasn't concerned about the president doing it because he doesn't read security briefings anyway that's in the story\nYou know there was so dumb and uninformed that he couldn't spill American secrets because we don't give any to him but we are kind of bummed out or that the Chinese are figuring out how he relates to people on a one to one basis so that they can they can uh suck up to him more effectively\nWe're basically yes mine is better than I go to and that's in the story is is actually an amazing story so he still continues to keep a cell phone and how he does that why nobody is able to take that from him is you know be\nHe pointed out saying that story was wrong but he didn't offer any\nEvidence that amazes me mom name talked media news is smoking side swipe genesis ill it's still in ... so it's good to me\nSo much for dropping by that I I've been talking with a woman you're back we'll continue this conversation is a little bit more on that I'm just a little bit more than a lot more than the news of this conversation I think is why we need to carry on this to her [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to a party [noise]\nWritten yourself if you

rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when the tragedy occurred how're you doing now\nWell George I'm I'm definitely doing better\nOne of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite ...\nAnd in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings have disability but I think of the brain as the infinite zone\nAnd I think of the body as the finite zone and for\nThe anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought and then thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set out a journey to try and understand more of it\nWhich is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nTrying to think culturally then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the Hoover drivers situation what happened there\nAre so about eight months ago I had a I got in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it\nDid you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want and he looked at me and a very strange stare and said I'll\nJust tell them Ralph set it on a book and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with them and he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] oh I Love about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons are smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it and the mylar balloons state inflated for many months\nTwo three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\nFind clients over at the clock

I'm Still trying of mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious masked because they've been working on computer ...\nAnd ... for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like ... times further than ... June ... a good way out there but they had narrowed down focus so\nHe has deliberately going on on November first started another surge because the new calculations forget that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only\nSeen by American Pie in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the\nConstellation of Orion is a winter constellation\nThat's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe and most so we have to wait until the constellation is up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date when you start November\nFirst that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths ... just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent infrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching\nSimply because we don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system the\nPerturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees of the sun then we'd be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even see yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look at it will be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect the men once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories of where\nMight come from why is this massive object all the way out the edge of the type about going into the cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that it was inside of our solar system where Neptune and your aunts are but then he got knocked out by Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but\nInto we find it and know exactly what it's worth it isn't exactly what the composition of all of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how it got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with this now for three years you have any sort of intuitive sense of what it could look like my best\nGuess is that it looks\nSort of like ... to we think it's a Neptune like planted just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere it probably won't have clown it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite land a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth you're where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it or something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lighter you're it's about two and a half light days\nYou and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and New York cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border of\nWhat was it that made you and drawn him or realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nThe clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto big travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep often one particular direction and there's no reason they should that should be randomly around the sky the fact\nThat they're all off in this one direction can only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headlines in October of twenty Eighteen are about ... one of those smaller objects that being swept off my whatever the massive book called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixty that's\nExactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nDo you need to people who ask questions about rogue planet and they never rue of the ... area and in all of that because it does come up with a lot what exactly are rogue planet\nHow can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy there\nCertainly are these wandering planets rogue planet and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star\nJust like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out\nUsually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now just hanging around on the outer edge but if you could have gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it\nCould have been completely adjusted from our solar system in which case it would just be wandering through space\nAnd so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it when people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something that says like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on knowing\nIf something like ... I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular day to because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nLooking at you Sunday Sunday and hides approaching there'd be no Sunday night mostly clear load that down to thirty nine Monday's sunshine continues to be in the forecast ice climbing to lower sixties\nMonday Night playing it's built into their chance for rain showers developing after midnight lows fall into the upper thirties Tuesday partly sunny cooler and hides reaching fifty one and then it's led chance for rain and snow showers developing on Tuesday night I'm been relatives still jumps go for news radio ...

morning for a group to come in the next day I\nWas mowing the lawn for the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility and things of that nature so at the end of the day\nAfter dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired so after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the coverage that will myself and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with huge stars but I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window\nI could see this misty grade bomb drifting in through the window\nAnd I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was ... and I could see light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me\nLooked like it was Comey writes in my head\nAnd I was just frozen with fascination I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead\nI could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision I was mesmerized by these hybrids live and\nThe feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with a living thing that was surrounding made and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time it's like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\n... can you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly I Try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and what's it like a word voice in your head tele possibly you\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the higher costs almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I could see ... these high regard but they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living when it's at the same time and they were just float by me but kind of leave\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just\nA feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was this super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future but I was supposed to recall misinformation because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future you\nKnow the only thing I couldn't

people and potential safety concerns in the wake of suspicious packages meal two prominent Democrats we're joined now by Robert Sellers\nWorkplace safety consultant and author of several books including one is too many uh training manual on the prevention of workplace violence she's based in Phoenix Robert what was your reaction when you heard about the packages\nWell I thought realistically that the current political climate was eventually got going to lead to something like this\nBecause of the rancor that we've had over the past election like a rank are coming up over the current election and the fact that people are just are not willing to listen to the other side it's either you are right or wrong and it doesn't matter which side obviously so\nWhen we've had this before right I mean ... was it a rights and that was mailed I don't know a few years back\nYeah I think it was just before the in two thousand sixty before the election and then it never really twenty seven games\nWe had a series that rice and being mailed to people and rice and seem to be the male of choice for more than a couple of years 'cause if you remember right after nine eleven I think there were some that were being bailed out too\nAnd then er here probably five six years ago there was a bunch and that has never really called\nDown so what do you do I mean how do you protect yourself if you think you might be targeted in some way shape or form with something suspicious in the mail\nWell the first thing you need to do is look at the package or envelop or whatever it is you're going to get in the mail or by delivery service and she who is sending it to you\nYou're not expecting a package from that individual\nThen you probably should call them ... ... email whatever the case may be and say hey you sent me a package of something and if they say no than there is a different sign that something's wrong with the packages that have been mailed to CNN and all these political\nFigures you know the name the return address was wrong her name which uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz I Believe it was yeah whoever sent them spelled her name Ron rise right and I don't think she's going to say about her own they wrongly she's sitting back and just people\nWho speak with Robert Sellers workplace safety expertise also author of a training manual on the prevention of workplace violence it's called the one too many and we're discussing these suspicious packages that have been mailed out I'm used to it to just pay attention to the delivery person if it's not the same person you might want to raise the flag of caution\nRight now and obviously you know the package delivery services\nAnd so on are going to have different people from time to time coming in but it it has been my experience\nIn the past that the delivery people coming into office buildings manufacturing plants or whatever are generally the same person day after day after day unless that person is on vacation if they come in and it's a different person you know just to ask a may you know where's second such\nYou know if they say he's on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air aside for this I gotta go gotta go gotta go yeah then there could be an issue with that because they're trying to get out of the building as fast as they possibly can\nAre these days I'm most the roots are in the seat something states something mode hopefully right but uh if there's something that I don't know just strikes you as odd what do you do I mean you should call nine one one right away you alert building security line and what's what's the protocol\nWell it I Would\nMore than likely call your Security Department first or whoever happens to be in charge of security I mean if you're in an office at a large office building it may not have a dedicated security team there so call your age are person first and let them make the decision to call\nIf you're working in a manufacturing plant\nThen you you know you don't want to call the security there and more than likely they're going to get a call nine one one and most of the guy that bleach are not going to be too concerned if it's just a false alarm for a suspicious package\nBecause they have their X ray machines and all types of other devices that can help and see whether or not ... or die\nWhich Robert Robert solid buzz dollars rather workplace safety consultant again one of his book is called one is too many it's Nineteen Minutes now after the

reporter at the Arizona Republic part of the u._s._a. today network Ron give it some numbers\nSo Phoenix the to the TV market has had over forty one thousand ads on just broadcast television that doesn't include all the cable channels as well so it's even worse than it sounds\nA but we are the number one marketed in the country that turned out for a huge political ads\nAnd you know as I noted in the story if you think that it's maybe a battered in Tucson for example there are actually number three they have over thirty thousand at so Arizona's really kind of getting bombarded now with with political messaging\nBoy and the majority of the ads feature what races\nYou know the Senate racing or is he is really the big one a this is the race between Democrat church in cinema and Republican Mark and mix Sally\n... one of the last ... competitive wages on the map it looks like right now so reporters spiritually bought well financed and ah had its share of sort of ugly messages from both

they're tired of this method in it is you know no surprise the messages are almost overwhelmingly negative in all the races the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start and uh you know people here have seen that across the board\nFor us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we're are increasingly politically competitive states so this is something that we've seen politics get ugly bookstore but it didn't you know ... carpet bomb us this way now we are definitely are seeing a lot more action on both sides\nSo to speak of Ron Hampton congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic had aids east central dot com they're part of the USA Today a network\nA piece about how Phoenix has just been overwhelmed with political ads this election year um you mentioned to kind of more broadly this has been significantly sharper increased over the last midterm election was that the measurement\nYeah it's a it compared to the ... terms even compared to twenty sixteen we're seeing a lot more action than what we're accustomed to and I think it's again a reflection of the stage\nGrowing political value or on the board or Arizona used to be just a solidly red state it might still be a red state but it's just far lighters you these ... Democrats feel pretty optimistic about their chances in a number of house races again the Senate races greenery too close to call\nAnd so we are just a you know inundated with these ah ads overwhelmingly negative and a in a lot of different races a lot of different corners of the state\nKendall lower ballot candidates actually get air time or they squeezed out at times by the Senate and governor's race\nYou know I think that they can they can get on the fact is that they just don't have as much financial or its power to do it so at any price they would have been relatively low arcane a campaign you know we have a Democrats running for example one in each house waves\nAre they are challenging got some new for us and ... are these are some times you know budget affairs we've even had some Republicans running in places where they don't normally abroad and so you know they are at least a casting these races but\nAgain these folks are are pretty far away from having a TV money at any great quantity\nAnybody saying that the saturation or perhaps consistent negativity can actually work against the candidate or is it a TV it's getting and candidates are going with it\nYou know gay people universally hate negative advertising but the fact is it does sort of help define your opponent been so people still do it it's still leads an impression with photos and the question is\nWhether there's enough there to poll someone down close enough that whatever you might be offering looks more attractive and and that's just kind of the tunnel model in politics\nIs Ron Ron Hampton congressional reporter at the end\nOwner republic it's twenty minutes now in front of the hour\nFond this morning Americas first news reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow us on Twitter Matt\nThis morning show you can follow me directly as well on Twitter would be prepared for plenty of cynicism and sarcasm [noise] while user name as ...

not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote\nWhat was it that you should have learned briefly\nThat there's so much that comes with Donald Trump that's right out in front and he doesn't hide things that he doesn't speak\nIn a kind of a double talk or synthetic language that a lot of experience and capable politicians use most things about Donald Trump or very visible and in that prologue I take myself to task\nFor not understanding what I could have learned in just looking at the words and the sentence you just read I won't give it away 'cause it's an entertaining prologue but I Do take myself to task for not saying hey maybe there's something right here in front of me and if I just spent some time to look and listen and learn\nI'll get ahead of the game it took me many many months of being around Donald Trump to figure out what I look back in retrospect might have been more obvious to me and it's been a little bit more time\nAnd the other point of the book was Trump's wild ride you note a thank you rally he held in Wisconsin just outside of Milwaukee after he had won the election\nAnd uh you note that Paul Ryan was there the house speaker not appeared once with Donald Trump during the campaign that is to say the twenty ... running mate had not campaigned with the party's twenty sixteen nominee Ryan shows up there more than seven thousand jubilant Trump supporters including a thousand\nWho had stood in sub freezing temperatures for more than six hours and Ryan says in that crowd of seven thousand I recognize maybe ten people I've been doing a Republican events practically all my life I didn't know any of them before not Republicans were Trump voters\nAre at the time I said the Republican Party was undergoing a hostile takeover I guess in a in a way it was\nIt was and it sort of depends on your definition of hostility a as Trump likes to say the rallies are full of spirit and energy and the great fire that he loves and the Trump supporters have this kind of almost ... billion call and response with Trump whether it's the wall or in a much\nMore aggressive sense lock her up really talking about Hillary Clinton but they have this sort of play act relationship is that all hostile wealth jumped doesn't think so come supporters do lots of Republicans look askance at and say\nWhere they're actually is is a leading us well it led Donald Trump to be the forty fifth or as the United states and those Trump supporters to identify with the Republican Party at least branded as they see Trump branding it as their new political home the duration of all that\nI don't know I Do not have a unified theory ... about where all this is going to do just try to describe what I've seen what's happened so far and what it might mean\nIt's interesting to note that an awful lot of people who were fed up with the conservative politicians who talked a conservative but didn't always vote conservative really led to a great extent to the Trump phenomenon and yet that inconsistency which is quite understandable than it did cause consternation among Republican ranks\nAnd if I had a man and a half million by furniture or a

supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie Sanders was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House when Obama was president\nAnd there's a there came up a number of times I'm a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not a news when I say\nMr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we now learn that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me well yeah I mean ... ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect\nAnd anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and if we're not protecting our president and we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I said that's only because\nUm there's this idiot on fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon\nSomebody who's taking cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bomb sent to the near wrote to me let's just played that part ... when he basically blaming me listen to what Sean Hannity says had a direct language\nMan we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage is being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the control project which does not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes Trump or the Robert De Niro is calling the president's devil an ... devil worshippers in effect you know\nI'm playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the dishes can be said what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on on the campaign has been ... so you're majoring\nLenient lame ing me because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid and he's a punk\nHe's a dog he's a pig he's a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care the gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster to the virus minutes of this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal\nHas wound up where he has to be talking about what he wants to punch people in the face well I'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\nTrump [noise]\nI'm On the um [noise] what are we talking about that [noise] it is the president [noise]\n\nAround is really really at all here but I imagine you know him talking about the president won in a punch the president in the face you would think CNN would agree with me that that incendiary rhetoric or those that want to dream of blowing up the White House and I got a whole montage I'm going to put together\nYou know this this is so close to slander this is right there on the line\nAnd I have my lawyers looking at it right now because I Am not you know it's all over the top you would've funny if you would think the John Avalon would join me in saying Robert Deniro incendiary rhetoric of wanting to punch the president is a threat to the president of the United states and frankly that's something I think the secret service should have looked into\nBut I have a history of saying we ought to protect all our president's words don't make people do things I think it's been irresponsible Maxine Waters and company\nTo get in people's faces and create proud city and gas stations in department stores and restaurants and you tell them they're not want to hear anywhere anymore\nAnd that CNN has been critical how dare people like Hannah they call it a mob there silent ... been deafening\nAnd we'll get to all of this today and uh we're eleven days from election day eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program you know it is so crazy what do you do for your home and your ...\nI have an awful lot about blowing up the White House\n[laughter]\n\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\n[noise] in the face of from Congress people\nSo when he was elected when I wrote on Twitter was we should impose martial law to make sure that the Russians were involved in the final tallies the votes and people were like martial law and what's wrong with you when you're alone it take you know he wants to send an alternative the border so I Would have done the military to the White House to get [laughter]\nYou know I had a dream the other night about that I was playing golf with Donald Trump when I was standing beside him with a club in my hand and I was you know considering my options when I suddenly woke up and it was one of those dreams when you want to just get back to sleep so you can finish it and I thought\nMr Bush is up against a Sean Hannity filter alone I needed to go on to your friend and that your your neighbors wondered about whether their independence or whether they're Republican I Want you to argue with them and given the\nPress always wars drivers are very you know I was in high school like if they can be on the gym [noise] what\nWe've got to do is fight in Congress fight in the court fight in the streets\nOrdinary people who simply longer needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who made the difference they marched Glenn yes some of them have died this is hard every ... do we have done this before we can do this again\nOne can say that they can go straight to hell in\nFact the only thing in your mouth is good for it brings Latimer oldster [noise]\nSo long as there's going to be our saving grace you know when to use about new Englander so [noise] it's going to walk into the bedroom and you know his daddy daddy [laughter]\nHe's ... he's a dog he's a pig is a con artist a mutt these idiots drugs how he wants to punch people in the face as well I'd like to punch him in the face [noise]\n\nIn orderly and ephemeral way kind of awful way we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump\nShe always says you know when they go low we [noise] we [noise] with this new democratic already\nYeah that's the new Democratic Party is about picking them we can't be civil throw rocks through Kevin McCarthy is the office window in a let's go out there and and we're going to get their faces and we're going to confront people break crowds and we're going to tell them you're not wanted anywhere anymore you know the amazing thing\nJerk had dead silent the news media has been\nI don't have a lot of time that I'm going to waste here yet on John Avalon or whatever his name is over a fake news CNN well De Niro it's not like the others why Robert De Niro by what I found is Sean Hannity was do we we just heard deniro\nAnd what the narrow was saying about the president our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face\nThat they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all when you see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter and and stage being echoed an apple pie by Fox News why Robert De Niro Sean Hannity October Fifteen that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic bomber because he must have heard Sean Hannity playing the narrows own words calling the president of punk a dog a pig a con a BS artist a mutt and saying that he wants to punch him out\nI Want to punch them in the face\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out the calls for violence against the president that frankly the right thing to do why didn't he joined me it was a question he needs to answer\nAs the red light just like CNN with the mobs we've been witnessing you can't even say the word mob when you watch women and children being run at a restaurant that's been conservatives that have been saying this ... this has gotta stop\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use my word totally among it is without a doubt whether or not it's not going to put a stop that his mob they have\nDog we already did that we already said they weren't mob no it's not my right hand people who are like the way the ... the way the country's going and a policy that they were not for those who is before you jump in okay [noise]\nThe same deniro who's screaming F Trump at the Tony Awards so blatantly stupid up punk good dog the pig a con artist to be as honest a mutt destroyed drum media completely ignoring what is the left vial calls for violence\nOn numerous occasions now going on for two years like you know fantasizing about blowing up the White House I Dream an awful lot about blowing it up\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out Paul for violence against the president imagine these words used by any conservative during the Obama years or the Clinton years\nIf you're a person of good will like I Am you deplore violence of any kind\nWe can settle our political differences at the ballot box eleven days\nAnd when you call out fake news for what it is that is not in any way so I Need to be clear for stupid people that want to purposely misinterpret words of people when you call them out ... having an agenda for being fake\nPhoney and fraudulent that is just telling the truth that they don't wanna hear\nOr when you point out that they spent basically every second of every minute of every hour of every day demonizing a president trying to deal agenda minds a duly elected president\nWhen people say that they care about the truth first and they say they really want to get to the bottom of Trump Russia collusion and Russia collusion at all or Russian influence at all and totally and completely and utterly ignore\nThe candidate of their choice obvious choice\nBuying Russian lives disseminating those lies to the American people in the lead up to an election that that that's not news that is strong opinion and that is not even opinion all it is a propaganda and misinformation\nMetal in separate envelopes which looked like a match for DNA collected during previous arrest say Oct faces at least five charges ray says there could be more if he's convicted on

this person to do this according to the charges that he now faces and the attorney general smiled and said I don't know and they said their parents to be a part of a sudden there is an answer there but obviously there will be more questions from those of us in the media and many other people give it up and saw was that white van that\nWas taken away and the images on that\nImages to writing

Carolinas and eastern North Carolina that has the best chance of seeing some severe weather tonight\nMan then there's that continues storm on Wall street doubt down at the closed two hundred Ninety

their works relief dot com\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to medical care for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month I think what you could do that\nYou know mid term elections tend to be a referendum on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with a dirty secret it's not so much Donald Trump that is a risk to get the Republicans in the house and Senate were much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nLeast one of the weaknesses as a relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build the name recognition in a district\nDon absolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much\nFor one Democrat that does listen to him as former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City was a big superPAC and it's putting resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands that they they they're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older\nI remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped a pay for Nineteen Ninety four and September that have we have the generic Republicans up seven and that there was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michel\nIrish presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to do the next speaker and we just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour far ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record something the orange she has outraged a\nHas outraged the uh uh Democrats their National Committee to to want the money needs to find its way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are outspending us virtually two to one in all those races this week\nAnd you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a TV ads even national chain stop polo see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and all they really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly\nIf the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass that is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be basically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters you know Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think both sick are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... come gridlock for two years I'd make a slightly different when I look I'm a ... for ... for them but\nI Know John is certainly knew Shaun I just hope we stop demonizing doing what Maxine Waters and say\nPrompts responsible you know ... who runs a set of uh uh sending that the ten or twelve bombs around or vice versa blend the Democrats can we focus on our national ... or our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've you've got to admit that we had the war we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan watery building the wall and having a translator sits ... okay so there are a little old Trump offered that deal to the Democrats that he would have\nDreamed it in a heartbeat why didn't I was pope because I was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats said yes but goodness gracious I Would do that in our heartbeat I think it makes sense a Donnelly in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nDonnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically and giving a half a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble I think the biggest polling surprise that we saw in the last week was Joe Manchin down by two\nPatrick Morrisey was on this program yesterday that seems like a potentially winnable race and west\nVirginia a mansion where we're not we're not ready to\nLinger too but I Will tell you mentioned didn't vote for the tax cuts mentioned didn't vote for Gorsuch it appears that mentioned had an election year can conversion by voting for Kavanaugh because he knows his career would be over and more importantly the economy was saved in West Virginia coal mining industry by Donald Trump not by mentioned\nAnd I think mentioned did have an election year a conversion and that's all to the\nElection year could mean lets be a phony for for a couple of months then we'll go back to being the liberal we really are\nNo he's not really a liberal he's the most conservative Democrat\nNot literally live in this environment that means it's just not a super radical you know left wing lunatics that's all that need I Will take a break we'll come back more John McLaughlin Doug shown are posters eight hundred nine four one showing is our number\nA we'll have the latest

prominent people will get to that of course the blame game has been on since the first thing this morning\nAnd it's absolutely sickening the way especially CNN has been handling this and much more straight ahead right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have

it's ... it's not a race just for my life for the people that live here for protecting the tax cuts the one time we finally got a real tax cut direct\nMoney into the pockets of the people that live here instead of all of the high taxes and you're from Albany under Governor Cuomo under the progress of socialist and ... and New York city that basically run\nOur our state and my opponent is one of them actually have a lower conservative writing than some of the costs socialists left leaning Democrats and the New York state assembly and he's trying to capture cell\nAs a Republican or a moderate in this district is now wants the word Democrat he's trying to deceive and cons of voters here and just say oh yeah yeah I'm a moderate I get along I work with everyone you know when you get you ... the Sox after Cuomo in silver whomever telling them what to do and he's one of the twenty four Democrats\nAcross this country who's trying to do the voters by saying oh no I won't vote for Nancy

to impeach president Rosie O'Donnell just at a fundraiser for I'm In New York city Governor Cuomo Alec Baldwin all these Hollywood left is we're all in\nJust trying to attack the president tried to hurt the upper a region of New York where are our middle class taxpayers are finally single break product recalls from this\nWouldn't hurt by the governor of New York I'll tell you that in you know the district by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job of according to the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited or not because of anything Albany has done\nI mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become under Cuomo and\nYou know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up fracking before the last election he just light to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now says securing the prosperity of natural gas that exists in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in in your area and we don't do\nYeah actually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into Binghamton Broome county which is on the border of Pennsylvania\nAnd you see the stark difference between the southern tier which is why so many jobs this is where IBM was actually founded now we've lost a thanks to the policies of the Democrats in Albany that have just strangled our economy we're actually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner in this district our family business which started in Nineteen forty six\nOn I've been around the district I traveled to on\nFifty or Seventy five businesses I mean one that has been praised us for tax reform and they're saying we're actually based tax cuts are were reinvest sang every one of them is giving a race to their employees or opponents or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we roll back on necessary regulation\nOr we can really open up the southern chaired a responsible gas drilling a Governor Cuomo votes will not let it happen my opponent repeat rebelled against that and this is how scary my opponent as we get into the fate last night he hasn't voted four times\nFor government takeover of our health care which is single payer which would cost the taxpayers nprcrowdsource bragged about by the socialist leaning guy boosted sponsored the bill will only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety ... billion in New

backbone\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job you get in the assembly now we can take by Chuck Schumer\nWho bragged about it and if you're a funny now they're kind of come to the district to help him get elected but she came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had a son Eric I'm there and his daughter of a monk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why they are having you on this isn't the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can when you just plug a Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat and Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that is going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are racing incredible amounts of money up and talking to my colleague all across the country the amount of money they're jumping into this race is to try to deceive the voters is really I I it's outrageous my opponent is federal spending they I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the hostage service in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly on still you know one of the conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to Wendy's elections we need to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we've got to support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gain even in upstate New York\nWhere we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping our small business community are small business humidity\nIt's about Ninety eight percent of my life to visit says in my region and they create most of the jobs that she's being held his life by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest are the only one benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo

country to a halt there will be gridlock there will be all sorts of attempts to disrupt the president from getting anything done\nAnd we don't want her we don't want to or disrupt the president's press for presidents in any more than ... left us already done\nAll right thanks so much for being with us Dana Rohrabacher eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number by the way some angel families those families that have had loved ones killed by illegal immigrants when the country they are actually planning to go down proactively to the border that I have to meet the caravan should they make it that far\nA let's get tore a busy phones will talk to them a let's say Hi to Donna is in Frederick Marilyn Donna Hi how are you glad you called eleven days away\nHi Shaun yeah I Can't wait to get out there in about and I've got several people up in my mind in keeping tabs we we have to get out there this is such a a referendum against the socialists and I got to say and live with the events the you know these devices that never detonated\nYou know I call them I guess the fishes devices 'cause we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got me thinking\nI'm sure that that's been confirmed as they when they said they had powder I'm assuming there was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot to chart a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and you know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when\nOne of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they blame everybody\nWell I'm not going to do with the left does year\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie Sanders was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre a year and I believe him\nWhen I was a different tack then you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um the bomb threats what concerned about is\nAs you mentioned the van with all this decker is\nOkay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the strategic ... as far as how they were placed how they with no you know issue with the the van itself but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde alum who\nThreatened to keep up with a life in a couple of weeks ago and\nHe was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be a connection between those individuals could there be more than one person involved in this whole scenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the Tom family was threatened as well\nAnd I've gone through a lot of the it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of 'em I've shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it's sadly as a part of being in the public eye and having strong political views it's it really is unfortunate um but\nNow you I Am is I think\nWhat we should be able to orange should be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and\nApparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place on this man this guy this background we have to find out of their accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together\nOr people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this program and we're going to wait and see and when we know the truth will pass it on to you\nOr we can yeah we ... we don't know\nYeah the truth matters and China I Want to say one other thing too with respect to the invasion what concerns me about that and it's not really getting recorded much\nIt's how many people are sick and we have children dying from her only like illnesses now so what talk in the brain and that's another\nIssue I you know I'm concerned about\nYou know well look we got we always got to stay on top of all these diseases and stay ahead of it and thank God we have some brilliant scientists and doctors that work endlessly out a long hours every day to to save us All right we've got to take a break he lives in I Will tell you that my pillow changed my life\nIt just works I Love it I Can't be without it I fall asleep faster I I stay asleep longer\nNow my pillows out Dunn themselves they take in what they do for your head and your neck and sleeping and they've

legally under any circumstances if you fix the company go through the normal refugee process if you apply for refugee status a permanent solution as possible in Mexico or in a third country\nBut I can tell you what certainly we're determined that illegal entry into the United states from this caravan will not be possible\nWhen our country is assaulted by thousands and thousands of people marching and they all say we're going to go into the country\nYou can't do that we can [noise] and [noise]\nIt's unfair to you but it's also unfair to thousands and thousands of people that have gone through a
