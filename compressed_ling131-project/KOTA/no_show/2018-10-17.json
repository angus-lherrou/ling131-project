view is truly a colorblind society\nAnd right now we have situations as we've seen at top universities in the United states where entire classes of people are being harmed\nBecause they end up having to uh find themselves I think discouraged from even applying to certain schools because\nThere are certain standards that are lowered to admit other students from different backgrounds you see this trial that began yesterday as as Harvard's race based admissions are under fire\nAnd so it's again testing how much rates matters to get into top schools joining us now is VJ NGO ... who's here to share how easy it is to do your way into a good school and he needs a outspoken advocate against affirmative action he wrote the book a few years back\nTitled almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black VJ how are you doing great today how can I talk to you I'm On the program what we need to what do we need to\nAbout like just focus on Harvard because that's in the news but what do we need to understand about how the admissions process in the schools is gamed by the people who play or the race card or just by racial considerations period\nOkay uh uh this uh this weekend I spoke at an end to affirmative action Rawley with Edward Blum he's the president of students for fair admissions which is suing Harvard\nUh basically diversity has become a justification for racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites at Harvard\nAccording to Harvard zone admissions data or they reduced Asian American Roman for forty three percent to Eighteen percent uh through a complicated ... a diverse if a ... scheme I in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nAre an eternal team back who they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury their report that's on trial right now and uh one important point I Want to make your audience today is that\nHarvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism a title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I end the Supreme Court's Fisher decision or you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism\nUm and it it shows a huge impact on admissions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity\nThe founding principal of America\nOr is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity at the founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that it's a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be the Supreme Court in Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right up but you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out UCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans as whites\nWithout practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education just let people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view would say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nOdd vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair than because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad can't compete a based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a\nFair playing field and UCLA UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well uh this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president ah with on MSNBC and made this point\nSome lawsuits is not about protecting Asian American in its brought by an anti civil rights act a man named had were well white rights activists who was trying to bring down very similar right and protection in American society town\nAnd I was told by an associate the is perfectly fine\nAs long as you're not putting a white male in a minority role\nSo it's okay to women and people of color into a historically white rolls like say hamlet or

I've been learning this as I go along because it it there's something going on here\nYeah and I don't need any good clean research on this stuff this is the kind of stuff that you would think fewer Harvard they'd be all over\nIt would be helpful on so\nLot of polling there's different types but it seems to be that all of it most of it\nIs based on a fundamental yes which is who's going to be a likely voter\nAnd one of the strongest indicators is what happened last election\nAnd you're going to look at the ... the last um you know or a non presidential elections to go back to twenty four team right well in twenty fourteen you had historic lows over fifty years it was the lowest turnout something like World War two\nAnd so if you're going to use that as a base of treat Trump election and\nThen twenty sixteen of course President Trump is elected\nWith all his venom towards women towards minorities teeth to pretend that somehow that is a solid base of pre Trump election with the ...\nIs a little bit I kind of you to look at like ... been Winkle in the sense that the pollsters\nTook a twenty fourteen election and then went up in the mountains and went to sleep like rip van Waco and came on down not knowing that a revolution that taking place ... and I think there's a lot more energy than the polls are picking up among young voters among non white voters and\nSo that's my guess as to what's happening but it is interesting Tom medicine these polls are just failing it's not random they are consistently under counting the vote the support for progressive tenants of color and this turns out to be far more problematic than it's just it's not just a mistake because there are real consequences\nThat either but they're not under accounting or missing progressive candidates who are white\nIs that route I I have to look more carefully at that I I it's not it certainly hasn't been is a star Los ... that mistake a stark stark a disparity yeah yeah\nVery interesting well by it as you continue your research into those would you would you keep us up to date\nYeah and if I could make one more point Tom places\nThis is problematic in of itself but it has the danger of becoming a self fulfilling prophecy because when you tell voters um that your candidate who use support has no shot at winning then\nAsked by the way the pollsters were speaking about Andrew Gillum in Florida for example\nFor ... right and right now in Maryland up and jealous who the former leader of the end of a lacy pie he was predicted to be neck and neck in the primary\nUrban ... gubernatorial candidate um and\nHe won a landslide primary victory that none of the pollsters predicted\nRight and now the polls have the way down to the Republican um and ah Larry Hogan in a state Marilyn that is two to one democratic um and when you put out into\nThe media this powerful message that the candidate has no shot\nIt's not just voters voters are busy come election day ah people have a lot of things to do and if you tell people you can as no shock they're more likely to stay home\nAnd also donors yeah nobody wants to back ashore loser and so this is very dangerous and this is why the Associated Press in updating it's a piece dial book earlier this year it\nSaid that because polls are so often intoxicating for journalists are ... that we are the eighties updating his style book to a with this word of caution to journalists\nPoll results that seek to preview the outcome of an election must never be the lead headline or single subjective any story\nAnd yet time and again this is what we're seeing\nWell particularly and tell her I mean a television news is the worst of those 'cause they're always oh breaking news here on the line you know ... and that all that stuff they don't even talk about issues they just started about horse racing personality\nAnd this and not talking about issues is really significant you could pull on any number of things but the key pulling on just how much do you like the candidate ... but not on the issue that if it's not they don't ... it's much more uh sell them and it's not as prominently report it now if you had an election here in Maryland on the issues\nAre for example a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage Seventy one percent of Maryland or support that\nAnd you're going down the list with us and that's the central plank or jealous\nThat the Saudi Government has sort of figure it out the party line and that they were gonna chalk this whole thing up to a botched interrogation which uh was evidently supposed to subdue this guy but not kill 'em and then put them on a plane back to Saudi Arabia um\nThey haven't officially stuck with that narrative and I you know I Wonder who the source of this war on NAFTA if it is telling I think how thoroughly pick through that you know kind of line of reasoning was but I'm not really sure at this point out\nYou know two weeks after this is Saudi Arabia can possibly I even have a a a lie here that uh they can stay with a straight face a this is very difficult to demonstrate that you were concerned about I don't know some rogue actor or something operating within your embassy if\nYou know it was looted law came out and said if if this is true that is going to be severe consequences um Mohammed bin Salman or at least his spokespeople in response to that said we will stick a dagger\nInto the heart of the American economy if you try to punish us have they backed us down has a ... rolled over\n[laughter] well I mean he said pretty clearly that we are not you know ... ... in the same breath in which he's been saying\nUh we are going to about severe consequences if this guy was killed by the Saudis he's also made it perfectly clear arms deals are not even on the table so it's kind of unclear if there's even a middle ground that he has in mind or he just hopes that at some point some treasury official can say okay here's had like two or three kind of pinprick things we can do\nAnd you can go to your you know can go on to say that\nWe're seeing a treasury by the way Steve ... went to Saudi Arabia this week or next to me\nI you know I don't have the I don't have I'm On my list of people I've been tracking who are going to go to the ... and the death\nOf as of yesterday he was still planning to go but to Trump or they'd be surprised\nIf he pulled out I mean I just don't think there's any sign from the destruction of of really any sort of moral reckoning occurring here and my prediction\nOn the Saudis side is going to be put forward as\nA fall guy here and even the fact that the Saudis have you know a demonstrated quite a\nWillingness to it you know basically purge their members of the royal family members of the business elite in that country they've got experience dealing with not just sort of mid level people than they need to you know drop through the sky or whatever that game of Thrones so miserable is but they do this for senior officials to and which makes me think\nThey will be willing actually to blame this on some ... or senior level\nMilitary intelligence officer and say look he was trying to burnish his credentials as a you know hard line guy who was going after enemies of the kingdom except he actually but trade the kingdom because he put his own personal ambitions over the interest\nThen and he may not even based on mid level where am I having that they can just drag some guy out of prison and say okay you're going to pretend that you're Joe blow and they're going to say this is Joe blow he was in the interrogation room and now we're gonna cut us off and not give them an opportunity to say a word that you're ... and Mark I'm all\nRight I mean I'm not saying they're not going to do that but it would be preposterous seeming\nTo make the fall guy is a junior level official when it went so many media reports suggest this\nWas a a major operation that could only up an authorized from senior\nWhat we really understand what do you live in so that affect the way\n[laughter] and and most and the Washington Post's reporting others that you know suggested that

rod surely was an absolute genius was any\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it or not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again or he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great great for shows for for television and film\nOr a one of our friends ... I wrote a book about the the twilight zone or in the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said the rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in his pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the fall but he's certainly dictated most of the scripts and\nAnd I was I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um you know he was had the patriotic fervor or you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part a show he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um\nThe idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleven parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and its stardom that Scott I'm for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did you get that from his combat oh it's as as this young and he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a day before the twilight zone during the twilight zone episode toilets on so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his\nMakeup and you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there were a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly at one called the purple testament which is actually setting lady um during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and and several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\n[noise] yes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writer so I was it was it was this fast you know and it was so vast wasteland it was a vast medium that was just\nDevoid of talent at the time and rod you know a\nJumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff outside stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the what he had a tree with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod and he started before you got in the twilight zone use a writer for other kinds of shows was an e\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was without question the most prestigious writer in television before this while it's all he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six fifty seven or as well as on started on fifty nine\nSo he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and she just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even control it\nThe ... the weather is center mostly clear throughout the early morning hours temperatures hold steady for the most part across the region when ... northern electorally five ...

I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're on the iPad the voice has not changed all that much bill you really are still waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and then I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and then my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got six notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nWhen you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod surely around there was he was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did his you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast on a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast\nMember and every time he was on this sad because you know he and the producer buck out and we're really seeing kilo the in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy\nTo see a Mr Serling when he was on the set talk to him about what was coming up in the next episode herself usually one and executive producer or creator comes onto was sad but it gets a little uptight yeah though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a\n... when rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around to\nTalk with you yeah yeah sure we went out for a margarita is every night and you know\nThat's right well how old were you when you were a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nNow so how did they find you believe for these parts of\nUm well actually it does run of the very first lead roles I it was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon\nThat course leach been played my mom and a and the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me and for long distance call and he also directed it is a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know I just called me up for praise of pet\nI Would say the guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new\nWell hi Angela car right now I've just released are novels a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing and you can go charge on purpose it's called the devil ... chicken and all that is very his weapon\nIt is yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorror horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead I\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first of all the vaccines like it was very escapist well then maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating I had a ... job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really light that my second question would be about the mysterious and things which I think a lot of that could be almost\nAre not necessarily ethic but could have unfolded into actual movies additional scenes uh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kinda unfolded into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect of the twilight zone and that's I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape is tone to it but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery on in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam Era he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know\nThe stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else they would they go into the gallery an escape\nOr through that so he never really said that about the twilight zone but I think is similar to a point can be made about the twilight zone as well and it is surprising that that\nThat someone hadn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film although there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly\nIt's twilight zone and you know influenced that could very well we'll just as just as well be toilets on movies that\nAre called twilight zone was it Jack Lemmon on one of the twilight zone he started for twilight zone yeah lady actually\nHe actually started one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right yeah yeah and he was terrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone and and three of the episodes that he was and\nHe was he a trumpet player in one of ...\n... is one called the passes for trumpet rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he's the director of jak called me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote were called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming\nThem [laughter] and you're out together anyway we can make this into a two part episode he wants to expand the answer to an allergist because Jack London was so good and rod said you know there's some you just can't you don't have the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something with a director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm just gonna film whatever does\nClassic classic

can go back to Nineteen eighty six the Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself\nAs a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools identified as a Native American during

stated that her mother and father were forced to\nLow because of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA has that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average
