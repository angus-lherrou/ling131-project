headway deep into the Russian heartland in his campaign\nIn the Eighteen hundreds of but the Russians burn Moscow then winter set in and the French had to retreat\nAnd during that retreats their army of five hundred thousand dwindled to just a hundred thousand survivors\nAnd more were killed by Tyson says then by the Russians so terrible scourge uh epidemic type has\nA also killed millions of prisoners and Nazi concentration camps for World War two and with conditions of poor nutrition and poor sanitation a typhoon is exactly the terrible toll or in camps such as Auschwitz to reason stack\nAnd Bergen belts\nAnd in addition it may also contributed to the deaths of millions more because he provided the excuse of for the Nazis surround the prisoners\nAnd a concentration camp inmates and tell them to go into disinfectant showers which turned out to be a gas chambers so tight that says a terrible terrible history and it's very disconcerting it's making a comeback it can be treated\nWith public health measures with hygiene\nA proper a cleanliness uh eradicating the fleas the transmitted of but also should occur uh would prompt administration of antibiotics that should not exact a terrible toll but yet a it's a telling\nIt to the telling situation there uh where this ancient discourages returning because of the terrible conditions that are occurring and homeless

exposed to a some sort of highly dangerous\nI'm a contaminant\nThat's above and beyond what the average person is exposed to so I'd have to see the test is you know Germany properly but you know you're like garbage people yeah we're supposed to mold were exposed to chemical ... breast milk contains a BPA and all kinds of things that could really\nAre are there are concerning frankly so uh what once you have this tablet that your body contains these things you have to say well what are my environmental exposures where am I getting it\nUh is is it from work is that an occupational exposure for example what type of work do you do for you in the automotive field former boom boom there you go I mean between a lead and between uh you know some of the chemicals that are used\nA yeah you're going to get some exposure\nOr and or in your you know climate around in the moist areas are or what we either on the job or\nOr in your home setting you might be exposed to certain things so really we have to do some detective work and that may require 'em home tests kid of the place that I use is a it's called by healthy home\nAnd the domain name is not dot com or dot org it's dot info so my healthy home dot info or does screening in the home not in your body to determine if there is mold growth or there's chemical exposure you might get one of their kids to do it yourself\nUm if necessary you need to call it a professional or people who do mold abatement ah they do a chemical testing at home sometimes they do that when you're about to purchase a home or or you know sometimes they do that after a flood or an exposure or if you're sick and you show symptoms and they're related to mold\nUm so what this test should do is just sort of a provide you with a kind of a yellow light like something's going on here there is some exposure how can you minimize your exposure\nOr how can you build resilience how can you know perhaps you can take a antioxidants or others a detox find supplements that can help your body cope with this burden because frankly we're all exposed to this stuff it's nobody's exempt ... maybe if you live in Antarctica or something\nOf but then um you know what you might be exposed because of your uh Coleman stove you using to keep warm\nUh nobody is is exempt from exposure to chemicals so uh\nIt uh this is actually in the field of environmental medicine that something called the American Academy of environmental medicine a I'm a member of that organization\nOr doctors to specialize in detoxify buying folks from environmental exposures and you might look at their directory physicians and see someone who is in your area who addresses these kinds of concerns kind of an environmental detective\nAll right thanks for that call very

let me take a deep breath here and see if I can untangle my tongue and pronounced the cry over glove he'll anemia okay now cry oh a is a word I think from Greek which means cold\nSo I'm ... means that\nWhen your blood it's exposed to cold or it's kind of critical thinking and this can result in a episodes that are painful and uh it's uh considered an auto immune disorder\nA with a response as many auto immune disorders have two presidents don't\nSo I mean the other thing is obviously avoiding the cold people like this probably should live in Miami or or in San Diego or to avoid cold exposure but it you know just even being exposed to a blast of air conditioning can trigger symptoms\nOr it's not a precisely like re notes syndrome although some of those symptoms maybe similar Reno just you know when you get a\nA blue fingertips from exposure to cold ... leaves a little more serious condition\nUm and it's rare\nSo I have no experience of treating patients with this condition

word markets side effects you said the side effects\nOf humor Rick where the same as those of print and so I think what you mean as the beneficial effects in terms of protecting you from\nUh the triggering by cold of your symptoms and so uh that's all to the good I don't see a problem there's also no problem in my opinion of\nMixing curriculum in with President so you might get sort of a

not everyone can get\nA very expert ah intensive care some people are sideline and some people are put to the head of the line in terms of participation of their concerns and lately uh computers have been playing a role\nOf with algorithms\nOr to help establish which patients are the tickets and which patients deserve\nA prompt attention well everybody comes to the emerging as they you know they're they're in pain or they're moaning and groaning they're demanding attention and sometimes they just say we take a seat or I think you're going to be fine and you wait a couple of hours and then they take care you hopefully the decision is correct maybe\nYou don't have a burst appendix or or an ... that could a threatened to kill you within minutes and these algorithms or help us we think are come two correct answers that said it's just\nI balling patients and coming up with a sort of an impression like oh man\nI got a bad feeling about this guy he looks for club sick or let's send them immediately or into surgery [noise]\nWell there's a new study that suggests that simply eyeball and patients may Trump formal assessment with an algorithm for prioritizing those who are seriously ill that's amazing it's just that there is something in human nature\nAh and doesn't even require a lot of training or experience that helps as its tablet whether somebody is circling the drain going down the tubes are headed for perdition\nA this is an article published recently in emergency met in something called the emergency medical journal\nAnd they compared the impression a not even up to just experienced doctors and nurses but even float vitamins and medical students\nWho've actually very little experience assessing patients versus nurses who used an established algorithm called the Danish emergency process ...\nWhich is a list of you know like blood pressure and heart ray and you know various parameters that you measure objectively that then will yield an answer to tell you is this patient very sick or can they wait\nAnd when the ability to search likely to have death within forty eight hours and thirty days was compared simply I bowling the patient was more accurate than structure tree on edge\nAnd so this should a lead us to rethink our our way of\nEvaluating patience with elaborate algorithms because um these algorithms are such complex systems take up the time of highly qualified nurses they potentially delayed care and they don't even deliver a result\nThat assists patients\nIn a voting death which is really\nThe bottom line when it comes to

almost a third of those sit down at recruiter take a first steps are immediately\nDisqualify why is that it's because of their wage\nUh the major reason that future potential soldiers disqualify a thirty one percent of them to qualify for this reason is obesity\nSo they've actually prepared a report for the military\nIt's called unhealthy and unprepared and it concludes sadly that America's rising numbers of overweight you are going to have real impacts on the military's ability to maintain effectiveness so part of the problem is that are not many kids want to join the military\nUh and the pool is diminishing or only twenty nine percent of young Americans are have a high school diploma no criminal record and know chronic medical issues okay so that's\nRight there [laughter] it's not a big pool I'm just Seventeen percent would be qualified unavailable for active duty and just Thirteen percent would qualify be available in the cheapest satisfactory score and the armed forces qualification test\nSo uh in in ...\nSixteen Thirteen percent of sixteen to twenty four year olds were interested in joining the military that's not very many and that number dropped two percent or twenty Seventeen to just eleven percent\nSo you know combination of factors you less people wanting to join the military\nAnd the ones that do they they can't pass the test in terms of uh they don't have a criminal record they have no chronic medical problems there not obese are and they're physically able to withstand the rigors of military training\nAnd oh by the way uh those that do qualify\nA active duty soldiers who are obese were thirty three percent more likely to suffer most skilled skills Lee injury and that translates to more than three and a half million injuries that occurred among

put it in a petri dish or of the cells\nAre basically uh started the aging process so it started themselves aging if they were held so you know the big problem is are are healthy normal cells age but\nCancer cells don't age so this holds a couple of opportunities wanted they could use this induce aging in campaign though yeah make them more susceptible to treatment to help cure cancers and the other is it offers you can slow down the aging process but interestingly does even when the cells were exposed when they added other cells to the culture\nThat hadn't been exposed to it they started age too even though the protein already been taken up so it's almost like it was a viral deals so it's like oh crap all you have to have this one cell that decides who wants to age and everything goes

you're not in the Green Bay\nPackers [laughter] give your brain work\nWell Dr ... gonna rabid night and how you can improve memory okay right before the break you were talking about what's right\nOkay so there's three A's of memory that anybody can use to improve their memory function the first is pay attention you must pay attention to things you want to remember\nWhen people forget where they put their glasses when they forget where something is in the house it's because they often weren't paying attention to where they put it in the first place show the number one thing and memory is paying attention so if you try to remember somebody's name in a conversation the first thing you have to pay attention to their name rather than\nInternally paying attention to yourself and what you're going to say next left paying attention\nThe second thing is association so this is very important because the brain is not a computer it does not run like a computer it's a complete mistake to call it a computer imaging association machine is designed and it's it's a fascinating it's human living tissue that somehow\nA associates one idea to another or one thing to another or even how it makes a concept is not understood but it associate so if you want to remember things\nYou need to associate them to other things um and this is what I tell the kids for example the crack in the study cookbook word pairs like this was for a test if you're trying to remember\nOne concept you always link it to another and you can use flash cards to link to remember things you must associate them so if you want to remember\nSomebody's name it's commonly said associate a feature of them with their name because a name as abstract it's hard to put a handle on a Tuesday whatever that is great but it's it's Susie has let's say I'm a nose shape or ears or eyebrows or something and you can associate Susie with those eyebrows\nKicks in memory okay a marks and they're going to get right let me as a\nMatter of fact I might have been doing it or not even knowing that when I was way back when taking E. M. P. like I Would remember that ... because it looked like a bachelor like I read I think is things that I had to remember the name and then like what are they remind me of that sounds like it yes\nSo you were a natural at using that technique of association to remember so there are many ways to do that because you could do it voluntarily to rhyming you could do it visually through what a person looks white but these are associations that in fact\nI'm I Need to talk about how memory happens up let me do the last day and then I'll talk about a memory out but the last day is called ... which is a\nTechnical work for motion you must control your emotions when you're trying to remember high stress ruins memory for example I\nWas driving through a ... I was driving\nTo ... to a meeting at guys I I'll guy stole the car apparently ran across a stop sign and\nStop and back right up into me\nAnd that took off in an escape and while he was backing up and demand like this can't be real and he did smash the front of my car hopefully no injuries to me or the car very badly to not the car with okay so it was the point is I was in such an emotional state of stress I couldn't remember anything except the guy was wearing a red hook that's because under\nExtreme stress your memory doesn't function well because it's not supposed to you're supposed to get the heck out of their whatever stressful situation you're in your designed it to their fight it out or get out of there\nAnd therefore memory is not really an important part and Clark stressed affects\nMemory and just people that like written in ... yeah it would\n... I wanted that I I've actually trained in forensic doses of all things\nAnd one of the Berlin doing\nBottom anytime you want and I witnessed the couch or classically\nError prone because memory is error prone and everything has to be crop oriented I Would have accounts can help pointing direction to finding evidence but you really need hard evidence to corroborate\nMemory and the reason memory as error prone just so we get to that point is that memory is not a videotape you do not have a videotape and your head\nAnd people do not remember everything that ever happened to him that's another ridiculous statement people make people do not remember everything that ever happened to them in their entire life or you will remember is important\nEvents that you paid attention to war really because there were emotionally driven show memories of construct it's very interesting it comes from the brain has modules that are located all over the\nPlace and somehow in some miraculous way it will draw from\nAh the visual part of the brand new ... will draw from the emotional part it'll draw from language it'll put these altogether when you go to remember something and you know sometimes you hear words you see the person you feel the emotion is she saying so that's part of the visual part\nThat comes in you hear things that's the language part you feel things that's from the emotional limited put it all has to come in to be reconstructed and every time it does that\nIt can make errors and changed the memory so even when you think of your childhood let's say you thought of a childhood memory\nIt's probably not accurate it as a general way it is it is a concept but it's probably not accurate if you went back and it somehow actually studied it but you will remember it as kind of a concept in emotional mental construct anyway that's what's wrong with them\nI mean I'm not sure what about you saying that we actually did a dachshund before you came on where we talked about the University of London found that three percent of people that have that quote first memory it's actually thinks now like the first memory and they have they didn't even like a ... memory\nRight because of memory is a construct that changes what time and an ad in a way it's let let's talk about why we have memory anyway how good Emory is supposed to be there to connect past advance to the future so we can survive in other words humans didn't evolve to use a pad and a tax people I mean that's why you know\nThese are byproducts of the fact that we evolved are higher function to survive better\nAnd so we need to adapt all the time the secret to survival flexibility on not rigidity flexibility always adapting so even our memories become adapted so that when we connect the past to the future\nWe don't make repeated errors\nAnd in fact one issue with people who have trouble let's say in general depression let's just say that is they're connected to a memory that won't change they won't change it they keep it the way it is and therefore they can adapt and change the future so this is a fascinating process of survival\nAnd it's always changing and um to get a memory to stay the way it is is over every time you bring it up it's prone to change and that's where there's nothing wrong with that just people have to recognize that even hold grudges let's say from past emotional events\nBicycle or something I mean it may be completely wrong about what happened because every time he remembered all it\nOnly show like yeah even that is is almost pointless in a way\nI'd take it you're watching current events interest [laughter]\nYeah I Am actually there's a fascinating thing on them up because everybody\nWants to be politically correct and all that but this is an interesting situation because um there are actually well we could talk about things such as people being convicted and going to lead a execution who've been wrongfully convicted on eyewitness accounts\nYeah and I think about ... percent of people executed or whatever and I said I don't know so\nYeah so under a severe emotional episode you can fix memory in your mind is completely wrong and this is a well known fact and it's interesting that and I don't want to get into you know he\nSaid\nYeah this does point out the problem of cooperation if she if something happened okay at some point in time and the question is how is this corroborated where's the evidence for it and of course that's different than a political issue which I don't go into but it is a very important the fact that eyewitness accounts no matter what is\nAre prone to Arab because memories prone to Arab because we are not videotape recorders\nBiologic system I should have been\nBetter educated when I was in high school because I could have used some of these is defenses [laughter] when my mother was using their things and I said no no that's the memory I had I was under duress and that changed it versus we caught ya\nOkay and the other thing is I take alcohol I mean alcohol can modify member yeah forty channel you know okay\nNow we are not always right\nAlcohol can modify memory so what this means is whoever testifies that somebody did something to me and they were under the influence of alcohol and let's say there were a teenager drinking\nA beer or whatever and the person says somebody to how do you how can you say that memories accurate if they're on boats with alcohol so again ah\nI Wish the couch a but anyway let's get away from that on to the fact that the the people who age we're always worried about their memory they worry about recall function they worried about how fast they can recall the work that thing to do as you get older with your memory is\nThat was kinda hard okay you're writing why there is a pulmonary embolism a a blocked artery in the long be blocked\nBrain vessel see a blockage in the colon or D a ruptured valves in the heart

K O da da and want to record some of em\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by soon\nAbsolutely ... you brought up if they're maybe you're in a profession where the jobs go across state to state and I even licensing it's a problem with our school teachers right now in order to be certified in one state and they moved to another\nHundreds of dollars and lots of time I need to be invested Everytime you go to a new Tate really living our current duty station for years so there are many people who are going to be unemployed for the year ... simply because they can't get that lights and thing\nIs that something that within the spouse community out at like Leavenworth where you are known your previous studio stations is that something that you found to be a relatively common issue between the ... the spouses who are supporting their spouse but having difficulty themselves\nOverwhelmingly common it really is I I\nI Would say the vast majority of people I Know are going to be unemployed this year at this particular duty station I I Know that employers can't say that they don't hire you for being a military spouse um but it's\nAbsolutely the case they can see it when they walk into work now you're overqualified and I've even been known to down my resume down to get jobs and I feel like that's something I should never have to do\nIt's not and that's one of those interesting things that you bring up that we've talked about on the show many times before where they can't come out and say like we're not going to hire the lord and hope she's going to be gone in a year would be her when there's someone\nWho's maybe not quite as qualified but it's going to be here in the long run\nThey can't say that but you can't stop them from thinking it can stop and frisk say well we're not going to hire you why not just not the right fit for the job why not just not they don't really need to divulge\nTheir reasoning behind it so it's one of those are the optics of it or like okay it looks nice that they're not not hiring you because you're a veteran or a military spouse or whatever but is that the reality\nBut you know what they're missing out on a lot they are missing out on the mavericks I mean we can make everything out of nothing we've had to move over and over and reinvent ourselves\nReinvent our family where we live we have to reinvent our tribes that we can do it I Know we can't say that military spouses are that the unsung hero in the you know the the the trip goes into work\nBut someone else has to sign all the kids up for school and the doctors appointments and the dentist and re enroll in all of the things and and just get everyone back into\nNormal normal group and\nIf we can do that year after year and not break our spirit but come out stronger on the other side you have no idea what we can do for your business\nThat's very true but the truth is of course that it's difficult for those jobs to to last because you are going to move as you said you're in Leavenworth for a year and then on to who knows where and you know what I mean there's probably a McDonald's in both places that most companies are fairly localized\nOne way around that we've talked to several people about this is starting your own business you can bring with you and that's what you've done where of course being the war and hoping the founder of hope designed limited so first off which just talk about what exactly your business is what do you do with hope design\nI hand craft jewelry and it's a military thing both vintage pieces as well as modern pizzas\nAnd I make pizza to support our military community we have expanded into patriotic jewelry for all the amazing red blooded\nAmericans out there that wants to support us we appreciate you and and this is the job that move with me uh fortunately grown enough that I could put my money where my mouth and hire other military spouses\nTo help me in the operations and\nWe've created jobs that can travel with them

ever trained in this or was it just something you pick up as a hobby\nI ... it had been a hobby since I was a little girl and when the craft of cooking I left\nMy life overtime I still enjoy it but we do it at home it's not the scale I needed to keep my hands busy and so I'm completely self taught amazing what you can find on YouTube now a days and uh just asking questions seeking out mentors and how it succeeded how\nDid it happen you decided to do this business because it's a big leap going from a hobby that you wouldn't joy to actually making it your profession when was that decision made and\nHow did it come about so my youngest son was three weeks old and I'm sure it was in a sleep deprived days that I looked at my husband said I'm so I have this idea and I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna bar a little bit of money I'm going to start the business and uh it's it's an ongoing joke between that they said I\nThink that's such a good idea [laughter] but he's humor me good man for it and uh the joke to this day is with whatever his gut instinct is about the jewelry business I just go completely against the grain and it works out incredibly well so he had the best business partner I could ever have\nWhen it came to producing a product how did you pick a you know like the military thing than a patriotic themed a jewelry but you do with the uh the exit route your broach broach Roche I never at All right I never wear one so I Would do but\nWhen you decide well how did you decide on that particular design was something that friends had seen before that you would made and they asked about or how did you come up with the idea to focus on that specifically\nFifteen dollars and quite a few have gotten to see Taylor Swift toward this year for you guessed it Fifteen dollars and that's

two million being provided in the last two years alone and that number is shore to grow even faster with that takes announcing first ticks which will provide the same services to\nFirst responders I spoke to a marine colonel Steve Weintraub\nThe chief strategy officer of that takes about the history and future of his organization [noise] we get\nDonated event tickets and those of an tickets can be to ball games can beat a concerts it can be a performing arts could be children's events it could be mixed martial arts fighting you never know what kind of events we get but these\nTickets are donated by by performers by artist by management groups by Venus and even private donors so these tickets get donated\nAnd then um what we do is we turn around and we distribute them to ah to our members\nAnd so we'll talk a little bit more about that but we started ten years ago um we're we're actually you know this is our ten year anniversary so we started back in two thousand eight and what happened was our um our founder and CEO was at a Super Bowl\nIn in Glendale, Arizona and where where were based out of Phoenix and so he's a navy vet and he was at the game with his buddy who's a fellow veteran it and they're they're they're they watch the uh the color guard march on the colors\nNational anthem scholars march off and they noticed that there's no seats for the color guard after they marched off they were a there are stay and watch the game but they didn't have any physical seats that were in the ... level and so\nUm our CEO Mike He was looking around and he noticed throughout the game that there was empty seats are literally seat the super bowl that weren't used to he came up with the idea of you know how can we get\nThese unused seats how can how can he get these tickets to unused seats and turn around and get them into the hands of veterans service members so they can attend these events and bring their friends and family so that's how the concept started and it started locally here in Phoenix, Arizona but\nSince then it's it's morphed into a a nationwide organization\nWe've got over nine hundred and forty six thousand that takes members what we call that textures and we've distributed over five point three million tickets since we started\nIt's really an amazing program and as I said I have now used that ticks as you mentioned mixed martial arts that's one of my favorite sporting events to go do\nAnd actually worked in eh may as well\nThere's a promotion in Maryland called show gun fights and there were tickets available there I entered for those tickets I received them and ended up paying something like Fifteen dollars for tickets that would cause three hundred\nI mean is it always that kind of a deal is it are are so many of them like you know coming down from hundreds of dollars down to Fifteen twenty bucks for a ticket\n... yeah absolutely and and so that's where the these tickets are donated their their donated by by donors and um\nThere there is a small transaction fee for for these tickets but it's never going to be more than fourteen dollars and Ninety seven cents and that's not per ticket desperate transaction regardless of what the face value of those tickets are because number one I'm\nA couple of bucks for some tickets you've got some skin in the game so you're going to go and that obviously makes our donors happy because they donate these tickets whether they want they want ... seats and in this case it's just it's veterans currently serving military their families having having a good time so\nAt that kind of um\nTo get tickets at at that type of a deal you can't go wrong\nYou really can't now what is the process for him for someone who's sitting out there are things what do I do I just go to the Web site and log on and there's tickets and I just click on them or are there different ways that people can get tickets or how do they go about it\nSo so the get tickets you have to be a vet six member and and we we call her vet tips members of that picture so Eric you you you are that ticks are just so\nYes and um so what happens is that you go to our website that ticks dot org V. E. T. T. I. X. dot O. R. G.\nUpper right hand corner it'll stay creating account so you click on that\nAnd it it's going to ask you some questions and we verify your service or either as currently serving military\nOr a veteran honorably discharged veteran or the immediate family member a service member killed in action and so how we do that is id dot me is the verification process that we used for that so if you're already a member of ID me it makes it that much easier so it takes\nThree to five minutes to sign up it doesn't cost anything to sign up\nOnce you get signed up and verified then you'll start receiving emails about events in your area so what happens is is that when you in your ah that you're signing up it'll say hey I Want to be notified of advance within a you know there was a drop down of X amount of miles within my location so you'll get\nDaily emails every morning about events in your area there is something you're interested in you click on that link\nAnd you put in for the event and it's that easy\nReally is quite pay was again I've gone through at once now and I plan on going through it again we do keep an eye on it to see what we might be able to take the family too and there's no shortage of events in fact\nI remember a just a earlier this year during the college football national championship\nSeason as we were getting closer and closer to that game there were actually tickets to that event available through vet tech so you know this this isn't just a small local events or say a baseball game at the end of the season when the team is having trouble filling the than there are some really\nWe review the wish make sure that date number one they qualified and then we we do our very best to grant that wish and so what that is is we will\nCure the tickets to said wish do a lot of times it's paid you know I you know my family and I we've always wanted to go to Walt Disney world or um you know see such and such basketball game or whatever\nUm and uh through heroes wish love the opportunity to be able to do that so what we do is we per cure the tickets for that now for them they've got to put a little skin and the game as well so unfortunately we can't afford to pay their way\nTheir meals their expenses and everything but if they can get to go to that venue than we provide the tickets for them and we even had um heroes wish requested tickets to Hamilton on Broadway which we were able to separate your so another great program\nAnd those tickets are hard to come by but that's the business of ethics is in and with heroes which they're going to do what they need to do to get make those which is coming through and with that takes just an amazing program that's available to all veterans out there as well as active duty\nMilitary members Steve a question for you is there a limit to how many requests people can put in or how many things they can\nI can look into getting tickets for I'm just a couple of blocks away from national park as I talk to you right now and I know the nationals have tickets up on that takes all the time you know it is it okay for someone to put in requests for several events are in their area\n[noise] yeah I I mean put in that for for whatever that you you're interested in and um you never know what you're going to get selected for so sometimes uh it depends on the number of tickets available\nThat we get from the donors I'm ... and so sometimes that's a factor but we've got um\nWe've got algorithms that will ensure that number one nobody can game the system so I'm ... you know you're not going to put in for\nThree national games three nights in a row and\nYou're probably not going to get selected for all three games um so it it's part of it has to do with supply and demand but um if if you don't get selected for that you'll get notified but\nUh but you you don't have to say okay I'm just putting in for one event at a time so yeah my my advice is put in for or whatever you see and if you get selected great if not keep trying\nWe're speaking with Steve Weintraub but he is the chief strategy officer of\nVet ticks and Steve let me ask you about this as the CFL of an organization that's had such great success as we said over five million tickets in the last ten years with over a million one point three million coming close one and a half in two thousand Seventeen alone\nWhat is the road map to that kind of success that other people who have you know maybe a similar organization is doing or not operating within the tickets but operating a nonprofit what would you recommend to those people who want to get to the level that that takes has gotten doing such a short period of time\n[noise] you know one of the things that you really made us I'm successful is number one the concept um\nYou know you you you can't deny that but the other thing is is the mission and uh you know if you want to call it a mission creep um we we specialize we only have two two programs and we don't deviate from those so um we we stay focused on our mission\nAnd but what we also do which made us successful is partnering with other you know quality\nVS those in in the veterans space and so um you know we we have strategic partners uh to include arm services YMCA VFW da Vinci a Navy Marine corps release it\n... and because we don't we don't do the things that they do and we don't try to you but what we do is have these informal partnerships with them where we can run for our members to those organizations if they require though those types of\nUh resources and we promote them at our strategic partners to our debt pictures and vice versa so\nPart of it is is just playing well in the sandbox and having cabinet that mission and sticking to it\nYou can find out more by visiting that

perspective they can work with us directly\nBut I I think really it's just getting that buy in from other companies from the c._e._o. down that corporate by and and this guy can help a set up those types of things\n... another thing that I was surprised to read all the taxes so that that the government has to hire disabled veterans or disabled employees what are some of the benefits that that companies can get from hiring people veterans\nWell either one of the first ones right off the top and I think it's there are several different but one of one of the ones we talk about a lot of companies do know about\nAnd there are companies taking huge and manage a of this particular aspect um\nLike the work opportunity tax credit or the W. O. T. C. I mean it has a range of around it's like twelve hundred dollars to up to Ninety six hundred dollars that they can get a for simply hiring a veteran\nThat's classified as a disabled veteran now there are other sources out there that basically if you're the company and I'm the veteran that I can get a stamp of approval that basically the time I come and apply for a job with your company and I met my paperwork that seals that blue seal that comes with it um\nIt tells you right away what I represent walking into the door so could it be something that's on a on a compete level you know if there was me and another person that you know may be representing forty two hundred and I represented Ninety six hundred dollars but everything else was equal that you might hire me perhaps\nYou know so that's just one example there's others like the returning heroes tax credit a window warrior tax credit which also has another up to Ninety six hundred dollars so there there's various of them out there especially state by state\nUm I I Know that there are some a lot of people a lot of employers believe that hiring somebody within the building is going to be dragged down their their business what are some of the common misconceptions that employers have about hiring people with disabilities\nWell one of the things that we've seen we've all seen you know the ... you know unfortunately the media can have a tendency to portray a disability such as post traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury in a completely negative light and it usually comes\nComes that way of something tragic happens and we find out the person's veteran then we find out the person has you know as a combat veteran and and the list goes on and so it's stigmatized a way way out of proportion and\nI'm so there are you know there are companies in fact the company straight out asked me one time at a at a summit I was at that what can they do to screen for\nPost traumatic stress disorder and that's absolutely the wrong angle I think the intent there was probably a a Ernest intent behind it like in other words what can we do to understand it more I think is where the questioned arrived but it wasn't the way it was asked and so it it came across simply is that they may be screening for you know to\nEradicate a particular thing when in fact ah that's that's just bad business to do\nYou could find out more at jobs dot D. A.

with autism and what they're doing to make people more aware of the CBS high on veterans back after that\nI did my time with them right back where am I going on where you are now\nI make your emergency plan today\nCommunicating brought to you by FEMA and the council to twenty degrees\nNow with CBS Ali on veterans powered by connecting that's dot com I may be but there again\nAccording to the autism society over three point five million Americans for about one percent of our total population are living with autism\nWhat you might not think about is their families are living with a two families like the brunt that maybe that Sean and his wife ... live in Minnesota with they're beautiful for him up and we've been in groups for children free of which have often after seeing the devastating\nWe sad story of medics rich a young boy with autism wandered away from his father and was later found dead the brunt of just reached out to be wanting to share their story in hopes that it would help other families dealing with autism and just as important we help the community at large understand how they might be able to help those family\nWith three children that have autism when people come up you where you come up to someone what's the first thing you think that people should know and understand about what it's like to raise children who have autism\nUm it would be nice if they understood that every child\nIs a different um even though we have three children with autism each one is on a different level of the spectrum and that's why they call it a spectrum so our six year old Brandon he's on a regular classroom with you know his his kids his age he's not in special education he talks and looks exactly like\nYou know his peers there's nothing that if you talk to him for about five minutes you wouldn't even be able to tell that he um has been diagnosed with autism um our daughter Cameron has a little social anxiety but she's five years old and she's also on a regular classroom\nBut our son Daniel um he's three years old and he um is not talking\nHe um has to be prompted to say words\nOut of his tummy it's hurting or if his foot hurts um he's not able to tell me that and like medics rich in North Carolina he is a wonder if you let go of his hand he'll run off\nAnd even if you call his name he won't respond now the other children they will if you call their name just like any other mom they'll respond by either being scared or they'll stop but not this one he has no sense of fear danger and he's a very attracted to water and so it's people come up to us and they look at the kids they say well this kid um\nYou pedal it's simply not going to win the race why do many people with no schooling you know advanced degree often become very wealthy

it tends to be good your household or business using additional revenue model that doesn't so we depend on you so you need to check out income store dot com that income store dot com\nWe're back with CBS all your own veterans powered by connecting vets dot com I'm Eric day\nBack to our talk about on the brunt of spam\nMaybe bet Sean and his wife's a letter\nOr raising a beautiful family it was a bit different than most there's three of their four children are autistic\nYou have four children your oldest Andrew is or not has not been diagnosed with autism how did you deal with that making sure that he understood for other families out there that might have an autistic child what have you found is the most are the best way to basically make these sibling aware and understanding of of the issues that are going on\nWell you know what Andrew actually is an advocate for his siblings um and he participates in their therapy he\nWill go into a a therapy center and he will sit in the room and watch them and he's watched their growth and he's watch their development and he actually can run therapy trials he\nUm is still engage with the therapist that sometimes they come out and get him to perform appeared modeling impair tutoring\nAnd we make sure that he takes care of them and he helps them to learn to read and dressed in the field and he is a good role model an example but not only that he understands a globally that there's kids that have autism outside of his household and so more than just his sister and his two brothers the impact that\nBut there's a whole community of children who can't speak\nOh who can't understand simple instructions and who are growing up and who may need a special services for the rest of their lives so Andrew wrote a letter to the governor and ask for more training for police officers\nOr to learn how to deal with people who have autism and he actually was invited to the state capital and I'm spoke with several senators about a bill\nIn the Senate here in the state of Minnesota that funds training for police officers when dealing with people who have autism\nSo he has been an advocate um and he has worked tirelessly to try and help create a better life for his siblings who have special needs and not just for them for um kids who need um special services and they nicknamed him Andrew the advocate [laughter] because he's working so hard to help the siblings\nThat it's awesome to hear absolutely awesome and actually that's been covered by the media out there in Minnesota and local CBS channel\nI did a story on what Andrew did bring attention to this issue and it's just another aspect of autism that we we might not consider on a day to day basis particularly those laws not living with children affected and not affected by it directly making sure that the police understand that this is someone you might have to deal with a little bit differently\n... years because yeah because um\nWe um you know Daniel ... being a wander will run off and you know he might run into somebody's house and that's a cute one he's three but what happens when he runs into somebody's house and he's Thirteen\nAnd he's wearing in his arms and they're trying to talk to him and he can't respond or talk back um they're going to call the police and the the people who live there may be afraid um and so it's so important that the police and law enforcement learn how to deal with kids who can't top court not really a danger um and not a threat but who have special\nNeeds um and that needs to be addressed before\nUm any weapons are drawn or or you know anybody's placed in handcuffs\nFor the military families who are affected by this who may have an autistic child and that may have a parent who's deployed for a year or six months or whatever the case may be\nIs there something that the friends and community who know the families can do you think would be particularly helpful when you have a single parent or a deployed parents or something like that\nTap into local organizations that provide volunteers PCH services um they can be tremendously helpful when it comes to just doing simple things like running to the grocery store\nUm they have sitters that could come into your home and you know sit with you for a few minutes ah there's respite care you know if if you got to\nA family member has deployed deaths deployed and moms home with an autistic child that's a lot of stress um so I encourage moms to connect with the vote volunteer organization that the broader community to see what services are available that can help ease the burden I'm\nEven thirty minutes a day or can can be helpful um we've had the luxury of having some family means a services come in and help out volunteers to come on Saturday afternoons just to spend an hour or two with the kids\nPlaying out back and that's been really really helpful for mom and I are just to get a a mental break up from from caring for the kids you know twenty four seven around the clock\nI can actually take a shower with the door closed and it's amazing\nI I think all parents understand to some extent the or how things change when you have a child it changes a little bit more when that child has autism what'd you say shorter\nYeah it does and you know that that's not the end of the story though you know when when they diagnose my children\nOr my third child with autism I went into a really really deep depression um I probably lost thirty pounds forty pounds maybe for fifty pounds I stopped eating\nUm stopped communicating with friends and family stop praying stopped going to church and I got so down because I thought that that was just the end of my children would never have a regular life they will never get married they would never graduated from college all the dreams that I've thought a half of my children\nI'm I believed in my heart that they were over and that they would live with me forever and they would never be potty trained and they would never get a high school diploma and they would ban special education all their lives\nBut it's about access and information and the information that I got was through this applied behavior therapy or a B a therapy that my kids could do better and live better and they came into our home and like my husband said they work with the kids forty hours a week um each child gets that much therapy\nAnd we saw great improvements after just two years\nAnd now my kids are in regular classrooms my son Daniel\nThe wander who can't speak as much as he would like and understand simple commands can actually read a book he can read words that he's never seen before we couldn't believe it we just found this out a couple of weeks ago so now we know we can communicate with him through language the written word and\nThat's amazing it would never have happened had we not gotten the early diagnosis had we been in denial and tried to\nPut it out and we not want it to put labels on him and had we not gotten the services early enough to make a difference before school starts and so now I Know that my kids can graduate from college they can get married they can make me a grandma when the time is right because we get the services early enough to make a difference in their lives\nWhat are some of the national organizations that you're aware of that you think would be most beneficial to families who are dealing with autism\nI'm like my husband said um the autism society or in their local state um each state has an autism society um autism speak is another a great organization I'm ever university has um\nA pediatric um\nDepartment and they have researchers in the neurological department and a lot of times they are the ones who um do the autism diagnoses and just connecting with the developmental\nPediatrician and a developmental psychologist\nUm who can put you in touch with organizations but you know we um have talked to our regular therapist I speech therapist an occupational therapist in our school professional to say hey who do we contact how can we get in touch with people because we're up in Minnesota with no family and friends um and we don't know who to go to because we don't\nYou know all of our friends have older children who have graduated from college\n... how do we get in touch with someone and you know once they put us in touch with one organization then we can go to a group meeting and talk to other parents is about connecting with the parents and getting the information they have access to those services um but you got to get yourself into those communities and those group\nMeetings and and and then you can find out about what's going on and who the best speech therapist is in town and who the\nBest uh who who's the best volunteer organization in town and you know what's coming up next the fund raises the runs the races to walk 'em the you know the the the you know camps all that happens when you get out there and you start connecting with people just like you connect to veterans\nYou know the the autism moms and dads they have to connect with one another because every piece of information I found out came from another mom or another day of a child who had autism who had been in the fight a little bit longer than me and that's why my husband and I always to reach back to try to pull up another parent who just got recently diagnosed\nUm would their child with autism or\nYou know who suspect that there may be um a diagnosis coming so that we can give them every ounce of information and support that we had um given to us\nA showing I wanted to ask you if there's a message that you could give to the parents out there who might have just recently received a diagnosis of autism with their child what would your message to them be\nTake action um yes you've got the diagnosis that opens up a whole world of services be active and\nSo Matt did they hire those extra people did that not happen or did the people they hired just not get the job done\nSo parents have a spokesperson for the VA told me they hire the VA has hired two hundred and two people who are you're working mandatory overtime to certify these officials the problem is that the the surfing applications are kind of hanging out in cyberspace and somebody at at at times\nPeople have to go into the system and manually certify them and wasn't certification happens that's how you get the money dispersed to bank accounts\nWhen things are done manually of course they're going to take a much longer and even with two hundred and twenty people I mean how many veterans do we have in college right now in the GI Bill do you have an idea of what the overall number as\nI Know the estimated number of that are that are affected ranges from a hundred and twenty thousand below into over three hundred thousand on the high end\nThree hundred thousand on the high end so if you have two hundred and twenty people I mean they're going to have to do what like Fifteen hundred or individuals for each of them I mean this is\nNot a good situation and as we've seen with previous deadlines and using the VA ID cards are which\nAre to be fair is to get nothing but free pancakes on Veterans Day and that kind of thing but they couldn't get that done for a year out and they've stolen we've gotten a third of those which a similar numbers about three hundred thousand people applied for him about a hundred thousand actually have them so far at last count\nUm how how confident are you that the VA is going to be able to fix this\nOut before it starts having an even more significant effect on the finances of those veterans go into school\nWell what makes matters worse and really isn't a good signal it is the school is like and Sonia banks school certifying official have a hotline they can call and when he called the hotline he has not given a timeline on when students can expect to see payments and when his executive aid called the hotline just last week she was told it had been more than thirty days has some certification is worse and\nSo it really is an issue of when the technical system linked up with another part on the Internet and that really is a technical glitch there's this building payments for hundreds of thousands of people\nWhat are the schools certifying officials are able to tell those students if anything what is the best course of action for them is there anything that they can do until those payments start coming in\nIf there are the veteran experiencing a genuine financial hardship the they recommend calling divvy its customer service number at eight eight eight four four to four five five one\nThat's an important number to be able to call and this is something that could have a significant effect not just on the the the short term finances but on the long term educational goals if this drags on and those vets are not being able to give and\nAre not being given their living allowance for two months than they might have to look into getting out of school because you know ... how are they going to know when it's going to get done\nSo you've got to hope that it does get fixed out sooner rather than later\nOn this is a major issue and again or is it surprising to you that they had a year to prepare for this and still ran into these kinds of problems when it was launched\nIt really seems like they kinda got caught with our pants down where the ... they they weren't even anticipating this problem and that kind of popped up out of nowhere and they were not prepared to deal with a now again the VA\nHas not really broadcast what they intend to do to needed immediate nor the schools are vying officials and definitely not set to veterans and at a time where student veterans you know going to school is a stressful time enough when you don't have to worry about\nUh paying your phone bill or paying your landlords don't care if if if if your if your department's check early this kid that they get their their rent on the first in the month\nSo it really is putting student veterans and a really tough position\nIt absolutely is and it's something that hopefully by next week's show will have a some update on this that will be positive but for now that's all we know that there is a deadline that's already been extended and at the school

I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example could how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense yet but the armistice in at the ... of the universe\nIs just one and and\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible at our our world is ... ... it's incredible the load that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the information to the human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that didn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention you know once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional mhm and and that there's there's trillions of other life forms\nYeah and not all human and has\nTo be it wouldn't be one did not want to anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nIs it adds to the end so now when you you have the finances and\nYou know they're real because history they feel real you know he was playing the usually not a language to really clearly defined what an addict and then in is\nIt near universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died\nOr I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed and it all communication is very elegant it's by thoughts\nAnd there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft\nDrinks and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to\nThe physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes I there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're on the beach I didn't really tell us what to look like when you have people come and I called it an astral tourism [laughter] she's it really is an adventure and you say beyond Bonnie\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from oh great Virginian only twenty four people\nCan attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop

individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber\nWhy is that because you can go deeper was no or external stimulus back and it's like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe flow chambers except in this case are not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like can be saying\nYou have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and the control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nSo they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have the headphones on and you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and eating exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey your friend who see

been really great that this is not something you can do on your own William where what are the culture has this existed in history\nOr Lisa from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are\nProbably the quintessential I'm a way that throughout history people have had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like the revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back through all the biblical text\nAll the transformational type of experiences\nKeep all their eggs or consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration\nIt shifted the was in\nTwo thousand years ago wasn't called that on the way it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu Buddhist tax 'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see\nThere's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can an out of body and validate life after life\nWell it gives you that infinite number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification\nThat you continue beyond your body and that that some in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake any because then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born\nAnd they don't know really what they are they they assume there are human being because they were\nThey found themselves on the human body mhm\nBut in actuality consciousness uh can take on any for I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering

Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main\nMy main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration\nIt's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nTalking to

potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen unexplored everyone\nWhen they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating at the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLook ... image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you want you to animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream again or they may be running in their non physical body\nI mean my point is that\nOut of body experiences are as natural as breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological machine mhm and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people are only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that makes you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid get here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried that and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I\nI began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back in the seventies and I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander\nIn these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in\nA pass lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time and um my point is that when a often will get\nInformation given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download it's more than just a download them information it's presented to us in experiential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOf what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this as one example\nRight but that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated a parasite ... anyone other than you are\nRight I and it's very important that that self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and\nYou know I always have somebody that's an avid believer and anything like that especially a religion you know what would you believe what face would you believe if you would have been born in India\nA if we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real\nAnd look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this big and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you\nWhat you are and where you're going nobody can you after you experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it and it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you have you talked about the common maybe put it down\nTo the average age of Pittsburgh antibody scene between ... zone and keep them recruit recount against it and it's often heated and it happens over and over again but it declines\nDuring the early teenage years why do you think that is so the tension forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it has an interest just a sec says something to do with it\nEvery ... yeah really focusing\nTheir attention on their um let's just say their biological urges ... mhm but children are I I I have an entire chapter devoted to this is my second book about children's out of body experience that\nI have received thousands of letters from over the decades from parents who have shared their experiences\nWith about their children unfortunately I'm\nIn our society sometimes either misinterpreted and you know they they ended up taking their child to a a psychologist or psychiatrist because it's out of there\nOut of the norm for our family to deal with so they end up giving the child Ritalin or something else to calm them down or whatever and uh it's unfortunate because there it's just natural\nYou know ... or ... you know what's funny is that\nNinety over Ninety percent of Americans believe that there is an afterlife\nThat we are non physical spiritual being and in other words if we are as most people believe them why would we be locked into a biological machine for our entire life Web when that's not what we are\nWe we have a natural ability\nTo explore beyond their physical limits\nThe Buddhist sub known this forever that's why they train young Buddhist boys at a very young age ... to begin their training and meditation because they're more open to having profound spiritual or multi dimensional experiences when they're young\nRight right and we\nDon't we don't receive that kind of we've been trained to be a very materialistic from birth so that has a tendency we have to overcome that conditioning that most of us have for the\nRight to not mostly focused on the external when we're young in somewhere between two to five years old and leave a forty one percent of the average number amount of bunny ...\nYes they're very young and they continue up to puberty and a lot of them were amazed I have twin boys and my boys both of them would have just profound experiences now it was it was amazing to me what they would do at night\nThat's incredible I had one on

... what is your question how's it going great what is your question my friends\nI'm curious as there's any relevance between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question question you mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\nA coalition of a bit of both the uh either long term memory and of the out of body experience itself\nBut not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like we're in stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years or so I I\nWell like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike TV I Would be associated with memory and on and and um issues when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body technique that doesn't just served their brain memory pattern that All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for that I have um I I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences\nOr have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that are written many books I'm\nIn their later years I'd say so if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially\nUm certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\n\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added buddy city\n... ... email them and I I can relate to it than to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah make myself pole and whatnot with my phone is so\nNow that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's the one of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of Trump\nWe're a brain injury we went to avoid those they they're not saying no no\nUh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even obese are part of the near death experience there also independent of them so it's important a distinction to make\nIt interesting and I gave in New Jersey and then well kind of like four days in a\nHey Lisa the call is coming from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right so\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and try to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them but if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if\nIf there is not like there's negative energy if you were going to create it\nIn your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness in a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell we are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went\nIt was a specific dream I guess I remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I was shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got us in cycling took off your helmet look\nDirectly at me didn't recognize that person you don't know anyone that um\nRide their own the motorcycle and\nIt was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection if anything and it was benign and with no there isn't a premonition of anything can happen if it isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak be on it and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because\nWe care to each other yeah and I don't know that\nWell out of body travel less likely mhm well it could have been there wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there was no consensus reality\nThere's that's that's why it's important to learn about a consensus realities are created by a collective\nGroup of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus there's many types of realities that exist and\nYou know multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to search them learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWere used a linear time right gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have\nGravity all the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my workshops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness that\nI can

can I Know this is going to sound really funny that I can actually sense things I'm\nI'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very excited I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that\nWe went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional storyteller from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I\nBought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted and so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my\nBig huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it counted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were all starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love the story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed can't so my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThey because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually had come out I'm actually from Colorado and I come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean in Texas because she had cancer and she was dying\nSo she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and if she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so\nI think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and I view the you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just listen to a place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts biologist loved it and um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nMhm extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance that's no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans to them and said that we've been passed the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you\nWell after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] yeah so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I Would just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm\nJust do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude sorry about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put in their head in the paper and I had\nThe biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like wow I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was epic\nMy goodness you know things fall out\nLiterally everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe coast of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom to be on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named\nSue oh [laughter] I thought it was just so\nPrecious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was the title to and I didn't think much about it we'll see started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like OSU made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue ha ha you know innocent\nBut then\nI I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book hunted managers brings I changed the name\nOf the people and how old was your nephew and I think at this topics okay in\nOne night in the middle of the night\nHe came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch mark ... and he was bleeding okay he\nWas bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had since his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had cut\nEar off of our cats and he said that still made him do it oh dear\nYou said stew sorry he kept\nCalling it's due this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three\nMonths my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died\nNow the one that did not like me anymore right and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't once you any here anymore [laughter]\nOh and how what did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThey use ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that oh we had no choice and then\nIf if if it to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew he stole something\nAgain you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I my mind them outside in the driveway ... it was just kind of ... and the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but time because the remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people ... or ... men go I'm just\nGoing to say that what what we ended up finding out was that it was a good sign up for it all it is it's it's strongly strongly haunted hill I'm ...\nNo you're you're getting these are gone\nWe'll come back to ... to ... am I just want to give you a quick

waters and she is not only a professional ... we can tell but he's also\nThe owner of the blue moon hunted hit two tours in Colorado so Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there\nWe're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just ... you\nKnow I'm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage your springs for spiritual reasons is because\nOriginally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American\nTribes and when they came here they had a pack\nBetween them that they would not fight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um natives actually\nCurse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that make sense to me [laughter]\nYeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter] you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this for your own body\nIt was awful he's he was suicide um come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people\nHere have not learned how to um processes\nThat they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the leg and that that's why they're so there are so many um artist answer thing or musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly can all this energy\nFor the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you\nDon't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't\n... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved here [laughter] oh and I see it happening to other people were warned them my a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I'm I was trying to help them out he was gone through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment\nTwo bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the ... the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can do what I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful well he burned out and about a month [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people profit\nThat said energy wherever they live with the haunted house or if it's a a relative to how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it bad [laughter]\nBecause you have to think about this why is a ghost here why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause they're going to result business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and um what do you say that\nI guess you would have to have a lot of anger to nice to be tethered here um if you are full of light and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it\nI don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nNow is a place that you were living in now hunted or did you met with non hunters salute lead the gas the goats follow you\nRight yes they do on line two words it's very funny see I've been doing them now for Seventeen years I I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter] just getting\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to her on a timer\nBecause whenever I Would walk in her name's bites\nThey would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know it'd be certain locations and then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would go on when you walk underneath them and I said yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash\nThis this town is very hunted by\nWell it's true for a lot of areas I mean even Boulder when you walk around there and then went there once a month and doing doing a show in the ... if you look at the top of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah because I happen to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't do any longer\nAnd ... did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happened so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like well\nIf you try to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic trick somebody you know really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you know other than Boulder and and

'cause it's today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment going exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the beast it mhm\nErratic flight plan or exactly up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed that I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not\nThere weren't a lot of people well yeah\nBut a lot of people saw that I mean just outrageously crazy\nAnd he followed his story we're in Kansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing and the story with consistent\nVery much so the way that that would that's a very good question right there because that's there was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly do with the farmers in Colorado are saying\nThat I mean this was amazing back then you know I'm ... you know we had the telegraph you\n... you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters or that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I\nHave had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal convention and one of my friends is named Dan Mathias and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak and um he saw a big foot or\nCome to his back door opened his door actually um\n[noise] he um the big foot\nActually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter] and um then has really committed his entire life\nTo the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick clips and the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself and I believe it's possible you know oh I mean why not\nWhat have you seen in the writing\nA he believes that my friend and he only if it's um\nThey are as you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top and then these long arms would try and goes on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking\nAt its it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is a poor hole where big foot is traveling intergalactic late and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility that may be\nBig flood is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm seeing something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell to me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and go and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I act I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking\nUnder the right name of course the Native Americans wouldn't have called this creature Bigfoot now would say [laughter] I wouldn't have gone tiny for no there there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the Native American Indians depending on\nWhere they lived in the Rockies where they were located a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here\nI mean I can think of a few names right off the hand that I mean\nThat's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating it opens so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story make sense you know it's all the same vein once we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot pathologist likes to call it um\nYou know that is just a name that it's been come up within the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the management springs area and garden of the guards in the area near pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting I on the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true now I looked into this one like on All right well when's the last time that we've actually\nHad somebody tried to remove the curse and it was back in two thousand and what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge lead again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished the Murphy company came in and they spend up quite a\nLot of money to have this building completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this this this and that was like three million dollars right there [noise]\nBut anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members\nOf the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spy building and I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the ... building that five crows flew up into the air and\nThere again yeah not somebody with a concept\nI mean there are certain things to be said for the history tours and things that are being done in the state could land mhm or how would tales being built and so forth where the the fine line there to honor and respect the lure of that particular lane\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give [noise] there's a legend about managing springs that you're not allowed to leave and unless you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou mark summoned to this town and I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs oh always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh I Am\nThe stories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting to look back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to those types of energy or maybe you have a ... in your house or something that might be visiting you\nWhat what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you know one thing we were to transition when I Move on already\nYeah see I think that when someone dies now I I Want to cut out this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days\nOr so that maybe that spirit lingers but they stay here are some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not a ghost [laughter] um\nOther stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\n'cause it's usually owns that particular person I\nSee I earlier on the conversation I did say to my house has haunted that I live in now yeah and that\nI Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak\nBible college it has a very interesting history and anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir music in my

hundred and fifty to two hundred miles seems like a lot ... on the ground yeah that's a that's a lot we can know that may be a head gasket or something else you're going to find out where the leak is from first and see if you want to go on with any further repairs cause of it was a head gasket leaking than it was running out or valve covers yeah those\nAre really unusual on a big ... like that yeah it that you normally when you get that kind of oil consumption of the aid because I'm assuming this to be a Fort Dodge GM chassis which is going to be either a three fifty or a or a three fifty one or or or\nYou know or sixty four yeah and there's just different things like that it can be an end they're gonna be eating that oil not leaking it most likely but as far as the vowels develops go if if it was if the liquid something separate and you could identify how to fix the leak those older the engine it is not always a bad idea to to remove the heads and fix the\nFix the valves at a

by doing it that way this company has been able to do die in a mom and her testing what this engine and\nThe emissions are reduced by about twenty percent and they explained that the way they get the computer to time the opening and closing of the valves is they place a sensor up some time on the crane shaft\nAnd from reading that article it's just really interesting it seems like just when you think the gas engine really cannot be improved very much\nThere's conflicting reports I'm On this whether or not they're going to stop the beetle here in the United states or their\nTheir sales were

[laughter]\nA retro fitted SUVs and many bands and mission is to completely rethink what an automobile is when a driver isn't needed heat that that is down the street from me corporate speak\nOr he did not get a timeline for the rollout but this was the part this is the part that I found interesting and it's I think going to be a major thing in mind that the vehicle will be manufacturing the current GM plant and what they said was a partnership but this size between two giants shows the importance of scale\nAnd legacy manufacturers in tech startups Jackie proposition Tesla has proven how difficult it can be ... be to produce a car from scratch without infrastructure in place for decades of assembly line experience GM and Honda have both they do so that's a\nAnd that's what everybody keeps saying is that Tesla is is pushing the market it in an amazing way and there there was an article I I I caught the headline on when it got to be careful of headline teases now in days but\nUh the fact was that BMWs recognizing the pressure that you know is being put on their midsize sedan by the by the model three um it's\nIt's it's real the but uh the the challenge for an upstart make or just like you said is that they could be innovative they can be pushing the boundaries\nBut they don't have that head start on actually having the facility to get it built and if the other manufacturers decide you know it's our turn to jump in all of a sudden the game just changed and they have to be so established to withstand that\nAnd now everybody ate and water than what I've learned about I loved living in a pool by myself but everybody else gets it gets harder to swim the ... river may not be watching and seeing what was going on while I was there to Tesla store and talking to some people that were a little more knowledgeable than me which was everybody there at the store\nThere are gearing up and they know that they're behind in production and they know they're a start up which when you look at Tesla or any car company that's I mean look there\nThere quite a ways they ought to start now they were right but they were they were a nobody I think it was they said it was two or three college kids that were coming up but it wasn't even most of that came up with Tesla it was these college guys and then that was taken taken over\nSo as an electric car but they started with nothing and the brutal where they are and they're ... imagine us guys if we decided we wanted to start up a bicycle company and compete which when ... no it's not going to happen so you start ... they've really made a mark\nBut one thing they did say they said no look our plants are smaller and we're trying to do this right to get it the way we want but once we get there they said their technology they have to build the cars once they get it to capacity is far beyond what the manufacturers have their like\nGuys come on we can send a rocket to space and landed on a\nPlatform that's moving and ... and they told me we can have a an entire plant that assembles cars with less than a third of the moving parts so they go together quicker hundred percent with robots and work twenty four hours round the clock and quickly they said if we ever hit that mark\nWe can do it and I think the other manufacturers are going to follow suit hopefully that'll bring her car coast though\nIf there were any a start up billionaires out there who want to buy a radio show yeah I mean not just put ... I mean if you would like to advertise on it but if you just want it and want us off [laughter] negotiating point right All right let's take a quick break you're listening to the end of the show\nWe recently sat down with Greg zip Adelie competition director for Stewart Haass racing as of today they've won five of the first eleven races for the twenty teens season Greg talked about the importance of the relationship with which filters\nYou got to a backfire and it and that put a huge load on that starter and either took some teeth off the flywheel or damage the starter and now when you crank it it's got the America back on TALK like instead of the night smooth I don't know how to make a smooth starting zone but\nAll the ... started as you can hear me say that but you ... and it's only they're just like\nAnd you'll ... is is this different sound like that to me it sounds like it\nStill something is turning over like in the engine but it's almost like it's like something metals hitting inside of it could\nBe wrong I ... I was just it seems different that would be hard to have happened but again\nI Would probably if you're concerned like that which it sounds like you are you called the national radio show\nA I Would remove the spark plugs and turn the engine over by hand by hand and see if you can feel anything and if you really concerned more scope looking cylinders see what you're seeing a maybe she really juice it up with the starting fluid which would be amazing\nBecause you go ... you could you could hydro locked it if she was just pointed in there like crazy but usually that's simply evaporate evil it's\nVery common to damage starters you might even just pull the starter off and take a look at it because those soldiers are really easy to get off of those cars\nTake it off and look at the teeth and see I mean I damaged one of my Model T I had the spark advanced a little too far on it when I was first put back together and it uh it backfired and broke the rope to start or on the fix that so it it's common we've had them in our shop where we've tried to crank up when cars weren't starting in the back\nFired when we're trying to get him going and when they backfire all sudden a starter changes from one sound do differ did you have a backfire\nNo no I was very surprised that it wasn't starting actually\nHe's normally are starting floor you know you put little but that in there it's going to start right up and I was turning it over quite a little bit and I was telling her you know don't just hold that was during floor just splits a little bit of time and I was really surprised that had actually started up because just a week before it had started walled off for me to drive to the to the shed and so\nWhat do you know is that energy to modify if you did it already happened is the engine modified or is it stock\nI Believe the internal their stock um course has a different carburetor you know it's pretty up with some you block off covers things like that but the Basij itself has stock\nCars that enjoy a night that engine should be a free wheeling engine even if a valve got hung up it brought the shouldn't impacted piston\nI'm that's what just makes me I guess I just start from scratch again and and your next step might be to just pull the spark plugs out and turn it over by hand if you feel anything and I I wouldn't discount the starter thing yet 'cause uh it's it's\n... it's possible Justin hold on a second I Want to talk about it like you're not really there for a second if this were you Shannon arrests and you had to pick your wife to either and you're expecting it just to start right up if you hit the started flowed right would you have your wife in the car trying to start it or would you have are under the hood with\nStarted foot wouldn't want to do I I have done this before and I usually have her inside cranking while I'm under the hood on an older car working the throttle in the same time so she has to do is turn the key or I'll just get myself a screwdriver and hit the ... side\nNot a good idea I I Would have a crank okay\nYou'd have her in the house while you were under the hood with a screwdriver would\nNot seek them out crank would you know yeah um and I didn't I don't have I didn't know now you know and it might turn into a\nWhy didn't you stop cranking that's I Know what I hear I hear you I imagine the ending poorly no matter what but I'd rather have her in their ... ruining it because I wouldn't be ... I didn't catch on fire they thought there was a little bit of an art to the spray you know it's so it's it up and then sometimes you gotta get up\nSo it\nWasn't there a thought but ... but I guess who would do what they are just\nYou know there was the idea is I'm always afraid that you're getting a going by no it might not idle long enough for me to\nJump in switched places a person's higher itself for speed transmissions all that and get this\nGoing the tires are holding air very well we've got to get this thing moving to a small little shed so it's like honey as soon as this thing starts up throw that air cleaner on shoes it's pretty easy drawn but the ... the put down a little bit I'm off to move it really quick that was my whole thought process and she doesn't drive stick\nShift at the time I guess\nIt makes total sense now that you say in that way I thought Justin thanks very much for the call 'cause what if it would have gone in my case and well it was already going why did\nYou get a phone neutral and blonde we'll or something I'm hoping that this car sounds like it'd be perfect classics for sure that'll do it for another hour of the end of the show until next time you can find that that under the hood showed dot com don't forget to check out the ended up a joke stored\nAnd we'll see on Facebook for about seven Janet ...

they're they're one of our friends and partners and they sell a just a ton I'm Talking thousands maybe extremely successful doesn't ... of gauges to fit those old cars every year\nSo that means either their brand new old cars being built or their existing old cars but there are thousands are so many when it comes to state now every year there's that many more going on the road so that there is a ton of them out there\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Leon Leon you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\nI have a a little one GMC pick up here with the creator and every for the last three times that I've changed the oil [noise] ah I ... I go about a hundred and thirty mile but I have the clerical after I started a refill it\nThirty mile an oil I thought well that I've got to add about a quarter after that I can go about Thirteen fourteen Fifteen hundred miles\nHave electric cars before if at oil you go to to use an oil\nWell it does take some auto yes it always has a ... it's only got two ... two thousand miles\nJust broken ...\nWhere's this last one I think\nMore like oh I Will have oil it'll tape recorded at at about a hundred and thirty mile but after that I Do have to put any until about ... what\nAre you gauging fall off of ... when you do your initial change what how are you knowing that you're full at that initial change\nI concur in order for mark on the Democratic you don't have any quarter though we'll shut it off 'cause it all up north to filter recall right and then a top it off the mark on the ...\nOkay how many courts do you know how many courts oil total you're pouring in this\nI start with I pour a in a court\nOkay and that's where you stop if you put any more than six then it will burn oil I Know that okay will burn out so I 'cause I Know if you put her accent and you started to fill the filter to shut it off you'll find that it's low in the stick but six is the mark on that if you do top that off we've had\nWe've had um burn oil before another thing on those that will cause them to burn oil\nOf as they age when they did in the beginning the driver's side valve cover where the P. T. V. valve isn't that has some baffled as they carbon up as it gets older it was a design that they changed later updated the valve cover\nBecause it would start to collect oil in the back of it and it would suck that oil into the engine and burn it\nAnd that was kind of like well why do I need a bell curve or know if it didn't do it originally it's because of the engine carbons up as it gets older this occurred so if it hasn't had that updated valve cover on it\nAnd that might explain in the oil being down and Thirteen hundred miles right it it changes some things so I'd say to try it once with just the six courts total including the you know the filter on there\nAnd an updated Val around there those that's at least that's where we would start in our shop we do those two things\nAnd see if the oil burning goes away now there might be some engine damage\nThat is causing the oil burning but we have found I I bet we found a dozen of them in the last couple of years where we've changed that drivers valve cover and there's been no more oil burning it all we were just talking about one yesterday a guy we put a valve cover on it about five years ago he says well yeah it has a burn oil since then so\nIt would cost about what's what's going to buy it and you will or for that are on the driver's side yeah look and see if that one has an updated valve cover available they'll specifically say this is an updated baffled vouchers cover for the driver's side because it was a source of oil burning\nLeon thanks very much for the call I let's take a quick break you're listening to the end of the

on you but Steven has been waiting calling from North Dakota long distance so we didn't want his rate to states Ohio so let's talk to Steven Steven welcome to the end of the show what can we do for you\nYes my question is I have about eighty five dodge diplomat with the three ... and it's got a definition of a little old ladies car I mean it's really it'll ours was Seventy thousand miles on it it looks really nice but the trouble I Am\nIn the ocean idle solo Lloyd is back on it and I have church all or and cannot find an engine idle someone like ...\nI was just kind of wondering you know what's my next option you know I kept ... at how do I work around that ... or or do I have to do some retrofitting or I guess that's kinda my question\nGot my first ticket from a police officer and an eighty five dodge diplomat\n... songs are driving the diplomat yeah one or what the gods diplomat what else was that what police cars basically it was a big big\nThey had a little Baron that ... that was kind of a similar site on chassis I think they had a yeah\nA lot do with an M ... is what they all they know that you're working like Seventy seven to eighty nine diplomat this was like Seventy seven to eighty one up there and then go in the band that lead to ride the Fifth Avenue and eighty ... eighty nine ... ...\n... I was going to anything and I saw it on to the well I'm going to turn yeah I'm\nFamiliar with the problem with that idle solemn Lloyd and like Twenty years ago uh I was unable to find them they were discontinued and you couldn't get him so your only choice was to retrofit a different carburetor on the vehicle\nOr find a good ... or ... and finding a good use one Twenty years ago proved impossible for us and we ended up putting a different carburetor on it I ended up buying a\nA a it'll ... it'll Brock replacement carburetor that had the electric choke on it the whole bit that was an admissions set up carburetor for that that would fit that vehicle\nPut that on network grateful for what we're doing but that was my only choice because there was just way too much time trying to find\nOtherwise you'd have to be fortunate enough to find an old the salvage yard or a self service yard that had an older vehicle section that happened to keep some of that type of car and maybe be able to go on line one to\nIt was still operational you could try for one of our partners is car dash part and you could try looking up to see if anyone has a oh what part would you look up for us you might look up a a carburetor\nBecause a few people might actually have them listed if they know they came off a good running car but the problem with that I saw him do it is\nA lot of auto recycling yards will sell you a carburetor in citizens they good rebuild double ... which means that the body of it is usable it's not so corroded that it can't be clean and rebuilt but none of the electronics will be guaranteed because there or the the ...\nBut it might be worth of of Seventy five dollar flyer to see if it you know if you could buy if you could find a cover and buy it and just confirmed to have that so annoyed on it at all parts\nAre still on it that you might find a good one because it was just electronic but it just happened to be a high failure rate item the coil fails inside\nBut you can go to Kurdish part try looking up a carburetor\nAnd I believe it or not they still have a partner before it ... there was a hundred and eighty five million pieces on there I'm going to guess that there might be someone out there that still has a carburetor\nOr you might be able to look up maybe a an engine and see if somebody has an engine from that make model on the shelf and then called up and see if you could talk about buying the carburetor off of it there surely not going to tell you the so annoyed for little or nothing unless you were willing to pay them yeah a a decent price to think that one part off but that would be an idea\nBecause there's still a lot of these cars running around in the non rust belt areas of our country that are on the road and working trying with these parts and they it's it's kind of amazing when you look around you'll see Honda's from the\nSeventies and stuff if the body didn't run out in the engine kept going they just have you ever go have you tried ...\nYes I Am I okay I ... and I've tried ... my local auto parts stores and it'll that type of thing that I haven't had any luck in all I have thought about retrofitting with a metal rock carburetor but the trouble is that I got to ... my uh manifold who could have just a two barrel car\nRight and they do at a broad makes them two barrels but that that set up would be different\nSteven thanks very much for the call eight six six five nine for for one five out when you talked to Dave in a second but let's give away a hoodie right now that we give away on our Facebook page\nEvery show we give away who do you all you have to do is like the page and joined the fan club at under the hood showed that common our winter is Jennifer Schmidt from Brighton, Michigan congratulations from us here at under the hood show you're going to need it getting cold also on our Facebook page we give away\nOther stuff various leave variety to lead intermittently what's the word I'm looking for every

spotless hey look at this piece of blank canvas from five hundred years ago it's\nAlright who ah who wins this pressure that you did a live video for\nAll right Steve Parker you are the winner of this

anyways it's a it's coming soon so don't forget about stuff like brush euro for Christmas you can even use it inside it was like what do I need one for now because you can use it inside you can have fun\nSo it's fine warming up so it has heat when until warms up yeah the bad thing about that is a lot of cars that have head gasket issues that start blowing exhaust gases into the cooling system when that ... gets fully warmed up\nAnd interrupting the cooling flow they act like that as they start up and they're starting to warm up oh great cold air warm air warmer hot air now the temp gives up now it's colder and it'll switch back and forth as you drive down the road and accelerate the celery\nThat's one of the that's a possibility the only other thing\nThat could be is the complete failure of one of the fresh air vents are where it would be ducking right past the heater core fresh I'll tell you they're right\nOr electronic temp sensor in the car that once it warms up as you know that it changes I mean those are a couple of things\nWe would be leaning towards doing a head gasket check on a vehicle like that to see if it with a with a gas tests or how do you do that but yeah it's a pretty simple primary under kept comes off when you make sure there's no pressure and you don't blow it off the shop needs to do\nWhat they would remove the cap they would use the or the or a full bottle whatever your applause draws gases from the radiator just air no who went through this who filled with liquid couple of separate compartments\nAnd as it goes through if there's hydrocarbons which has anything that's in your tailpipe coming out in that coup in which there should be none of it indicates there's a crack in a block or ahead or a head gasket leak\nImmediately turns colors from usually from blue to yellow when you got a problem but if that doesn't occur there is a good indication that it's something else but that's a quick cheap test to find out what's going on\nOur head gasket better these days or has my life changed as I've become an adult\n[noise] yeah and well here's part of it though they've started going to similar mated metals between the had the block okay\nA lot of her head gasket problems came in when we had aluminum cylinder head sitting on top of a cast iron block and so you had different properties of cheating different properties of the of of the ability to to flex under heat\nAnd marrying the too doesn't always work great\nBut when I was in high school at ten year old car with a Nineteen eighty car so they were more likely to be\nWell and and even before that you had cast iron on top of caster ... which wasn't as much of a problem but when they started getting in the middle ground where they had a looming um on top of Kashmir and that's what we started seeing more and more ... more problems with head gasket in in in the gas gets\nNow as we've advanced we have got aluminum blocks aluminium heads and also you are in some situations not pushing\n'em the pressure or through the system that you were on other ones but I think the bigger issue would probably be\nThe fact that the coolant properties have gotten better or I think people are more in tune with coolant maintenance than they probably were ten years ago\nI think that court maintenance used to be looked upon in a similar fashion as break fluid maintenance maintenance is today replace it when there's a leak exactly yeah and they didn't realize the ability for that cool and to build up alkaline properties and metallic properties\nJust based on its use through the vehicle and and those are the things over time if it's not replaced and that that cool it gets whether it be too acidic or to have even one property Heather it'll start\nChip away at the gas gets and eventually cause they pose a leak and so I think that the combination of some of those things have changed that so we don't see those those normal offenders like we usually would still

I went over his house and you turn the water supply on and I could see it just so turn the water off\nMy it's devastating you know there are a few things in in my\nConstruction work that are more devastating I see I don't do much electrical work um so I don't have that trepidation um\nBut a leak plumbing work and the league doing doing all of that work and then having a leak\nIs just devastating whether it's pressure or rain\nIt's just something that you know because it can cost so much damage so go ahead\nI'm so\nI said let's take it apart and take a look at what's going on and so we ... to turn the water off on bolted the supply line and ah I looked into the supply line and this thing was the supply line was ancient he said the supply line\nHas been here since I bought the house when it was built Eighteen years ago\nBut where do you want to spend your money on a cleaning or on um softening\nSo that's the that's the toss up for cost\nWouldn't you agree broke yeah and you didn't mention magnesium is one of those elements yeah in the water that that is stripped out through a water\nA softening system um you know there's a real shift against traditional salt systems because\nThe material is discharged in from the brain tank into the sewer system right and the sewer system goes out into you know a ...\nRivers and streams and that sort of thing and they say the access solved is is harmful well it's chilly ugly actually that's not true because it's typically water is typically treated now before it goes into the water systems\nUsed to be that you could just I guess getting the salt out of the water for some of this for water systems is real expensive in tough tasks I I think that eventually one\nWe will have a water treatment plants that eliminates salt and we'll pump the water back into the political system better than it first was and I think that we will eventually learn how to turn our salt water sees into freshwater at a competitive prices\nSo solved the chemical name for salt is ... uh sodium chloride yes I'm Sorry that right yeah and then there's also potassium court which was another solved right so potassium is an alternative\nTo ah the\nProtests ... the potassium chloride to a sodium chloride water softening systems are also\nThere is a\nNew system which is a cartridge based system that is gaining traction and it uses um [noise] oh my gosh the the uh ...\n... yes mhm that used to clean water heaters what is it contained a\nActually a what is ... contain it contains food grade citric acid yeah so yeah this new cartridge\nSystem utilizes hey citric acid based means\nOf conditioning the water because we know that citric acid works great for cleaning up calcium in line at all and heard have you heard how a that\nIs kept how that's maintained as it cartridges cartridge every six months and are the kinds of you know the prices of I don't\nBut I Know that they're growing in popularity and I also know that I don't think that there's anything is effective is the salt system I think if you really want soft water that the salt system is still the best mhm I didn't say that it was the most\nEcological or green or whatever but I think it's still the best in my experience based on having had that\nSystem well near adults have had the cartridge I have the cartridge here do have a a citric acid cartridge I Do have a sister gas in ... and how's that working for you\nI'm Still have spots but they don't claim that they'll eliminate all the spots uh-huh uh do they have calcium build up but still have spots\nSeems like the detergent the shampoo this so we can use less\nThat that will go farther uh-huh uh know build up of calcium on faucets and that sort of thing so it for my money it's a great\nAlternative are certainly a lot less well this fighting you say you still have spots do you have as many as with the conventional you know [noise]\nSame same thing and it would help if I

going to tell our audience why it's important well what a termites love termites love organic material would wouldn't paper motives organic yeah but they ... well they don't like cream puff as much as they like would okay\nSo what's firewood its word so what firewood\nSitting on the dirt is or what a meal for term I oh yeah it's a term might attracting and the term I Can't do it well so if the wood that attracts the termites from the earth is against the building then that is a bridge to more food your house\nOkay now having said that about word against the building\nLet's talk about your fence\nNot everybody that listens to us has a fenced in there and I know that most people that happened to be the next item by the way on your Saturday well I don't want to do pretty well but I just want to talk about it for a second if you have a fence chances are you have a solid fence on one side of your house and a gated fence\nAt the other side of the house one preventing entry altogether and the other allowing entry to the back yard from the side OK okay guy and when you build a fence\nThat has a gate in it that's going to prevent people from getting in and out without using unless they use the gate right and then you could lock the gate\nYou usually put a fence post against the house you do\nYes and\nPeople think that that is a right thing to do the right thing to do wrong but if you you can put the fence posts against the house or you people don't usually put a four by four they put a two by four and they bolted into the house okay right but what you need to do before you both to two by four or four by four\nTo the house is to put a piece of sheet metal in between the house wall exterior wall covering\nAnd the post well what does that do that is a rat shield it is a term might shield and by the way that is required by the building code if you build a fence against a house and do not\nInsulate the post from the wall with a metal you may have to pull it all down and put the metal in two fold\nOne acts as a tour my barrier but also it prevents the collection of moisture which will become excessive\nAnd cause rocked\nSo right the termite is a flashing which prevents excessive moisture which will cause ...\nAlso in the same vein a in would decks when you vote I a ledger for a deck to your house right using metal barrier you when you put your debt boards

Thirteen eighty one hundred forty seven go Broncos\nAlone won't him to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host pres McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ...\nAnd Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies for those that may not know Dr paint gets he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's\nWorked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we called mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contracting and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right\nAs a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy now and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over in the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's their link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a\nMagnesium deficiency spending the gleaming museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more harassed or whatever right that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the phones to start getting phone line is you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down\nThis great absorption rate is really incredible because it it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula\nThere is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd want to let you know the doctor ... has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners\nSo when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain in stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you it's lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you tried the ... formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks this book is packed with vital information\nAbout why your calcium needs change with age Cal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression for tea it's all in this very informative book\nAnd get Chris I'm going to give away an extra three out of my comment formula for the first one hundred color so it's really important for your listeners to pick up the phone and take advantage of that will\nThank you for doing that Dr pain 'cause I really appreciate it folks this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eight to three ... three nine to give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to well if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael pick us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress\nAnd how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium and how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because of this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drifts little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah there's a point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nNow is your biggest you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the transmitters and the nerve and when you take this complex formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I\nKnow I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back in ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula and\nI drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nWell heart disease is uh something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body to be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow\nAnd um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old\nAnd the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer may turn out to her friends so that's amazing\nWhen I use this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team\nAnd I had a number of athletes the within us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication is many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium and the system well though the very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because the fish and many of them it's also blocking\nFurther absorption though it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah you have nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium\nThe gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd want to let you know the Dr ... says arranged a very special introductory offer it's only

free number it's one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to ...\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain and stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you it's lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of every day stress\nYou know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to

like that young ruler are lacking one thing as well but Jesus promising the that if we take a far cry if we sell our possessions than we have the promise of him\nA promise that leads to a life outside

but there's a few that are a little bit tender foot at an older and so they want them to have some TLC over the winter\nSo they sent out a message to former camp family saying would you be interested in wintering\nA horse for us they got a call back from a grandmother right away and she said oh we would love to do that we're just so thankful for the experience that my granddaughter\nSo the staffer match\nUh the folk to halfway point they back their hearts trailers up one to another\nAnd as soon as they got the horse moved from one trailer to the other is a little girl and her father were the ones who came to pick him up she hopped into back in a trailer and started cutting the horse\nTalking to him about how wonderful the winner was going to be with them and the great play see what's going to say and how much you love camp\nIn the meantime data to talking to the client ranch person\nHe said I just want you to know what that experience meant for us\nHe said I worked three jobs\nAnd

budget or reach a campaign goal we will have missed something along the way\nWe believe that following Jesus means learning how to follow him in every area of our lives\nIncluding how we handle money the truth is that God does it need our money but he notes that our attitude about money reflects our obedience to the lord ship of Christ and how well we truly grass\nThat he is the source of all we have\nAs far as the cry started goal in life is not gaining power\nPossession or prestige for ourselves\nWe exist along with the entire body of Christ to fulfill the great commission and until our death\nWhen we're Christians and his church act with generosity to serve others and it's a clear picture of Christ who at the crux gave his life and all they had\nSo that we might have life
