matronly describe ... that during the civil war they're nice ones with the Trump voters the Trump supporters are the racist massage plus\nThe native is but I think everybody knows relatives here so it's it's ... it's one side's gonna win and once I was going to lose and listeners over show are the backbone of this country or wherever so people just got to get out and get on with it\nWell I think again the Kavanaugh battle was ... it was so interesting and so many ways so painful of course in other ways but it's all it's better I think that Trump decided to go with a Bush guy\nBecause because now we see that a Bush Republican it doesn't matter just like it didn't matter than McCain was the nominee in two thousand eight\nAs long as you stand in a way of their attempt at\nSocial ... construction and open borders open markets gender fluidity all these things\nThen they ... they will set about to destroy you your family or make make it make if they could ensure that you've never work again so it's almost better like people want it to other people to be on the court but I think in a way this was genius because it galvanized so many of the Republicans\nLook you're a constitutional lawyer you've been a clerk you know at the highest levels how how much betting going on how decent these people are across the board it's it's outrageous you know the judge Kavanaugh has never been looked at it I don't think as as cutting edge on social conservatives\nAre area of the law he's very much about the show so what I called the construction industry to state is really a a a a a second horses harness what's what Judge Gorsuch and that's the point it doesn't matter\nWhat their what they did with judge Kavanaugh is the politics of personal destruction they want to destroy people that stay in their way and I think it was very evident of what they did they try to destroy him and his family and it doesn't matter if you could put a moderate Republican up there and they'll they will try to do this\nWell and again this is an ended up\nShowing accent you know when it when it ... when when it's needed you can have Mitch McConnell actually stand up and fight and when the Republicans are unified ... they can do anything I mean the end would be nice if they were that unified on the wall and all these other things at the president wants to do\nNo maybe this is the ... the irony of this is maybe it's the first woman as your listeners know law I've been at the I I buy the crowd of being at the cutting edge of this kind of anti establishment a effort I've I've been you know battle Mitch McConnell for many years with disagreed on on just about every topic\nBut we've got a you know he he stood tall normally Republicans cut and run\nThe first founded the gunfire from the social justice warriors they will run because they're afraid of being scared they're afraid of being called racist they're afraid of all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually shut the distance or and I think it was a seminal moment inflection point in the Republican Party and now I think we've got everybody's going to fight not said nothing but great things about the actual column for the last three or four days of the reasons he deserves kudos\nHe really show real leadership and did not cut and run a judge Kaplan is cutting or a judge kept the fight for judge Kavanaugh his confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency\nAnd I think it it it it who's everybody to really understand that the Republican establishment and\nThe populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts of the you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want and that's what's going to take this November and quite frankly I take that\nGoing forward so hopefully law this is the beginning of people saying you know we got to work together this is what happened in six to you know when I step into the campaign in August\nWe'll quake fracture everything pull together and wasn't me it was writes Priebus it was many many people that go together the bought the grassroots gather people like you with your show that brought the grassroots effort together with the establishment and we won in strict the lesson one where's the night it\nPut a differences off to the side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the stakes are so high look at what happened ... and look what happened at the vote objects capital on the floor of the United States Senate\nLooking that people have given their lives to this country than with the rule of law the federal we have that that behavior of those protesters with just unacceptable and what happened afterwards which is really kind of model that's coming so if you want to make sure that the\nLike the senators were harassed or an attack on the Senate and if like Ted Cruz and his wife were basically accosted by people at a restaurant and the chase down an ally if that's what you want the future will be built up\nBut at the end boggling may have to vote for somewhere and I was in your district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about President Trump and going forward and that's why we got to pull together\nA well we're talking to Steve Bannon here on the ... show the uh the generic ballot has shrunk somewhat but these are still the Republicans' biggest hurdle Steven these house races seems to be women voters women

know if it was yesterday the day before I think it was on CNN what was she on I ... she was on with us Ari she was on with Chris Hayes on ... on ah MSNBC we played we only play the short version of this on the show last night\nFor the life of me I could not figure out what her answer was she was talked to she was asked basically about what are you going to do when you get into office assuming which probably will win because it's a very liberal district\nBoroughs Manhattan are all really liberal so what are you going to do like what's your governing strategy going to be\nWhat's your plan [laughter] well I think a lot of it has to do with changing our strategy around we got her hand you know a lot of hype baseball and inside the beltway Taylor now you know when you say that term thrown around but\nVery few organizers and Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if all different kind of strategy and what it is really about organize all and and really thinking about that word organizing says most people won't strictly taking their\nActions or we're in bringing together a hopeful that strategy of putting pressure\nOn the ... and so the only focusing pressured inside it's really it's really interesting thought\nThat's a really interesting thought okay I don't know what she just said\nWe only played a shorter version of it on TV Now wishing we played the whole thing because it's funnier\n\nCan you can you can you using her phrase can week's segment and some of that James so I can listen to it again maybe I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept in up maybe I'm just a little tired last night with the big night\nYou know it was a very I mean I'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last

that term thrown around\n\nOkay he's just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategy inside baseball\nI'm a forgive me but she at least from what I've heard she seemed like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person she got people to go out and vote vote for her she probably a nice person I don't understand what she's saying\nWe need more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there\nBut he still goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay\nOn top of the u._s. understanding as it has to be like all abortion all gender fluidity higher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalized drugs pot all all of it has to be force it on the American people\nAre so like Obama she never really will leave the organizing world\nThere are very few organizers will Congress and I don't think that organizers operate differently it different kind of strategy\nYeah they they're they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan

resigning as Trump's UN ambassador a lot of people speculating that this could mean Haley will be slot it in and Lindsey Graham Senate\nAnd Lindsey Graham could take over as attorney general the United states I Am I concerned about that is Lindsey Graham it's been such a good force in the U.S Senate\nWho replaces him in that role me Nikki Haley supporting the president such as supporting the twenty twenty I mean there was no hesitation and her voice when she said that I mean\nThe trumps party now party now this is Donald Trump's party you can get more establishment the Nikki Haley she's

understand no more alpha male stuff we're going to be getting in touch with her\nFeminine side and I I agree with you on me too it's horrible what's happening and and we need to vanquished toxic masculinity just what\nWomen want a man who\nAgonized about not being more feminine\nJoining us now is not a man who does that's Adam Corolla one of our favorites of course host one of the most popular a podcast and the United states a comedian and actor director and of course host of the Adam ... show Adam I'm John Mayer is very upset about\nThe kind of toxic masculinity that you and others like you Adam clearly exhibit\nWorst off when it comes to women he's like a guy who's standing at a buffet lecturing yuan caloric intake\nThat guy his mode through the entire Victoria's Secret catalog maybe it's telling you to back off when it comes to the ladies easy for him to say\nIt's all virtues signaling right like\nI I I don't I don't get I don't get why that's attractive I did write a book\nThat ten years old called and fifty years while all the checks and I should have said in between nine and Thirteen Years we'll all be checked ...\nIt's an interesting move and I don't I don't I don't get it I I studied this for a long time when I was doing love lined with Dr Drew\nThose years and drew used to tell me you know sort of the feminine way is the better way like they're more evolved\nAnd I kept saying no I have kids they need us they need to bother and they they need a mother and we offer to different things part of the plan is to turn men and women into the same unit this is all kind of part of the bigger\nPush for gender sort of a conformity\nWell I think again the more successful Trump is\nOn the economy or foreign policy are getting all these judges on the court or any of the good things that have been happening consumer confidence the more successful Trump is the angrier\nAnd more possessed the less become since so whether it's the toxic masculinity or whether it's you know chaining themselves to the White House doors are ... they they seem to be truly upset that things are going well in the country\nWell it's interesting I mean you know it it it's in saying oh well there's a couple of things that are funny\nMy wife works where the progressive woman and at some point I don't know Bill Maher name came up and\nMaybe he was gonna retire or something like that and she has now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought\nYeah Bill Maher and everyone on late night and all that news outlet and MSNBC and CNN it's it's weird that hey it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the news you what Hannity Tucker\nAt a handful of other people excluded or the exception but almost everyone's on your side and you're claiming we have no voices on our side\nIt's interesting and then also oh here's how effective it is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young twenty five I mean you know thirty five and one one of the guys who worked with me who's an intelligent enough guy\nSays to me yesterday as it pertains to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't get it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy in there get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the paths that just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record it move forward\nI don't understand why they didn't do that at like ... you don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage\nAll the stuff that got hooked up in the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all the fate of allegations from high school they're going through your book I said what do you think they were due to that guy but he literally thought we'll just get a new guy in there that he'll get a fair shake if it will move forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh um\nAny other ... and most I think of other guys who ran against Trump and the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary how many of them would have stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of Trump knew that this was something you could not back\nFrom he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam when we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches CNN and MSNBC and NBC and that's where he gets his information\nHe'd legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with capital\n... and that's to me\nWhere the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all\nThe information and it's all going through the filter and so ... what choice what draw the conclusion of she could no it couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either

in the news we talked with um oh Lorie last week about or\nSay what\nYeah uh uh about uh the the whole NAFTA thing\nAnd\nThere's a really interesting piece in Huffington Post right now it says that the the ... this new NAFTA rewrite the Trump is written\nIs like a lobbyist paradise\nIt provides and I'm quoting from the article other the headline is Trump's new NAFTA shows what he really cares about generous protections for Republican aligned industries including big pharma and fossil fuel polluters\nAnd get away with it I mean the president of the United states has got to be the most scrutinized person or one of them in the world so people are going to be pulling in hard on this guy's now he's like he he ran when he was sixty nine years old I'm surprised that he's in\nA notice that they also kind of extends to I'm\nBrett Kavanaugh um and he's got a huge paper trail off of perjury and yet they're years he stepped up to the plate he wants to be in the Supreme Court right so anyway that's my thought\nDan what you're missing is a brilliantly laid out in the first Fifteen minutes or so of Michael Moore movie eleven nine thirty nine eleven I um and that is that Donald Trump actually never intended to seriously run for president\n... when he learned that ... stuff and we now know this from Michael Cohen\nUm when he learned the ... funny is that if that sort of correct name um was being paid more than he was for her reality show I think Americans got singing or something like that um when he learned that she was making more money than he was from NBC\nHe got together with those people with Michael Cohen and in in a couple of buddies and said how can we convince NBC that I'm a bigger star than she is and they should pay me more and and you know pick up the the franchise for another half a decade or so and they thought well you know\nOr do something splashy you know announced that you're running for president as a Republican and so they hired a bunch of people for fifty dollars an hour to be there and I applaud him and hold signs it came down the elevator he gave a completely off the top of his head speech because he wasn't seriously planning on running for president a expected that you\nKnow his goal was within forty eight hours have NBC's ... said to him oh no no don't run for president will give you more money do do a product that making those money we want more of that\nAnd then the AA NBC didn't take the bait and be they'd already scheduled to events to make it look like a real event and they'd already hired actors for those two events but so many more people than just\nThe actor showed up that in blue Trump's a mind and he was like wow this is fun he got to give these you know speeches and his cheering crowds and so after those two are done this was supposed to be the whole enchilada right say the rollout and the two and the two rallies\nAfter those were done he was like I Want to keep doing this this is fun not that he wanted to be president he never wanted to be president he didn't even have an acceptance speech written he wasn't planning on being president unfortunately for him the people around him wanted him to be president the Republicans and the and the other billionaires\nBecause they figured he can get them the tax cuts and then the deregulation that they wanted\nAnd so you know he became president unintentionally\nSo I don't think you know you know yeah he should've known that the scrutiny was coming he didn't know the scrutiny was coming he thought there's no way in hell I'm going to become president I mean literally did not have an acceptance speech written so damn\nBut what he'd be interested in a U.S being scrutinized but have you get a come to pass that people see them as a ... you\nKnow and this is why this is why he has fought releasing his tax returns even though he promised in the campaign that asked if he was elected he would release them into why he has people swearing loyalty oaths as to why he has people signing nondisclosure agreements\nIt's why he keeps threatened to sue people on the it's why he wanted to get Brett Kavanaugh on the court because Kavanaugh thinks the president's can't be interrogated a you know I\nYeah I you know would they do a logical extension of what you're pointing out Dan is what we're seeing played out right now\nDown thanks a lot for the call Lewis in Salisbury North Carolina Lewis what's the station and listen to\n'em on cable right at this moment okay and I tell you man I Will give you a cable in Portland I Know about

called in to talk about Kevin off what all the information you gay lead to day is is uh is is mind blowing all mind boggling to\nTo to me because it's so much that ah the Trump Administration is doing

Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we had going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consulting Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for Google Plus\nIs is a Google a social networking platform that it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago\nI'm going to be missed was if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know that this is the story that for going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it\nReally in a way that they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout his entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy bonds or posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or if book so there was no separate income stream coming from ... in the meantime it\nIt got kind of numbered by Facebook into thinking well you gotta have the ads you got to have the sponsor poster got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it gets given what's going on\nBut sizes everything with social media scale is everything at Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time and\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during I I if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're a theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why interpretation\nAnd they cut us out on it and write and now of course the kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion the sun is setting of Google Plus over a period of about ten months but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and um it would've been a lot better all around that they had\nIn the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of cocoa puff which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month\nOr per head using us that's going to continue to Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf which probably not a good idea and the first place at the time at the you're right it it seemed at the time that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out\nBut as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that norm is growth has now tripped him up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick

I Would say yes there were very surprised to hear that but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking\nThe time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell the ... cycle conditions you you of course she learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you do more of your research do new\nThat absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today you\nKnow let's talk about till after what did you uncovered and let's find out your explanation my aunt a guy who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating to look ... and uh she ... she came out with so much down to things but what did you find\n... yeah I thought that these are very important phenomenon it's\nIt's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I read them that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like the ... the and the other things will talk about and I read that at any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas consciousness century pictured does work\nItself out ... the ...\nTo me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns felt experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should\nSay that he studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combined the result\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm and Dr dean rate and we'll just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six six six sigma refers to the typical odds against champ when you've got to stick stigma result the odds that the that the effect has just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd intellect at the we have six sigma result\nSo the ... experiment study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very you know very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nChain is given a picture by the experimenter as an experimenter said game I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room the jaded mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know affect your game of looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent rang\nAnd I'm Wondering you know my the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nOr so from the typical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect the twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically suggest that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ...\nThen we would know each other thought all the time sure is that it actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you where they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nIs parking wildlife resources that are on the boats are patrolling the

really see what they're out there\nThat is such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond\nWhat our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us that are existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for your mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\nKnow I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can\nAbsorb it let's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill ... George Hi\nHi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and do you use\nIt uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine's or ...\nOr ... or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universal I have a new term for it I Would call it may be senior\nLair already know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically a I like the sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety\nOr depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded than Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nI suspect chemicals in the brain and therefore they do affect chemical you consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical brain to these medications or even an aspirin or\nTylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches going back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and affects the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is and\nI'm assignments diseases that dementia affects the brain and it does affect the conscious system minds it does seem that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if the mine and the brains are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have\nWhether it's medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation or\nWhat I argue and and some others argue that says well is that a correlation is not always imply causation or in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically concluded that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo caster up when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up\nYou have a larger fire ... more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire and I've used the brain and a bit of a different way with the brain of highly related to consciousness\nDamage the brain you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism for like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but\nIt's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen are you what do you think mark of reincarnation as\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I talk about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it ... it's it's mind boggling isn't it\n... and George I agree with you chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing a man or sometimes they're if I'd buy medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have\nBirth marks or physical deformity\nThat are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life and in some cases the medical records are found so it had nothing to be on genetic beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else is going on and the researchers call it a third factor or\nA person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\n... ... exactly so with preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nI charge and why I have a question for your gas sure how high thank you for

that made me become vegetarian and instead now there was no one else around you know I'm for now animals I find myself and I guess um\nI'd like to know people that are tell a path now you said that people are are usually good with meditation I haven't done a lot of meditation my life but I have been on my own a tremendous amount of time I'm at a deep thinker I'm spiritual\nAnd I think I'm an empathetic per se so I wanted to know these qualities allow people to be more healthy path again in addition for about twenty two years I've seen double and triple digit\nI'm On the clock on you know addresses license plates and whatnot and the anomaly that has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them\nBut um I I kind of thinking that this might be a tell a path experience as well or seeing something like kitchens to on the clock\nAnd I'm thinking of important messages you know something important in your life seeing signs\nSo I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nNow a while ago someone had told me um you know they're in the solar actually different I I Believe in the Bible or some religions it's the body and mind here at all and so I kind of things that what you're saying is differentiating\nBetween ... and this is the parent or the other person is an outside in the spirit inside\nOr either or but um I I I kinda think of it on his spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think mark the ... maybe one in the say what are you saying\nThank you for your question Monique [noise] um I tend to agree with your George and there's an allergy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things\nWhich is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a world pool within that country so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water so what happens when the physical body died that like a world full of dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me of consciousness and conscious of having this Friday of experiences whether localized in a whirlpool or otherwise industry or\nDo you think that consciousness is a normal process of living ... or it's supernatural\nOr the way I view consciousness is that it's like Max Planck he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if from consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but\nAny rain changes over to snow once you two inches

had a really really rough year after year probably the worst year of my life and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see a ... year next coming or being a lot better hopefully ... starting to\nGo more my way to Maureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes at what um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards spoil 'em and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt\nThat have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of coal is no this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that\nFor you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying I'm ... but if you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day ... change are really trying to put it on a mask but you're not feeling\nIs that correct or not they are a variety\nOf okay like so put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person feels like a lot of people of the one that comes to when they have an issue is that correct [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... that you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone always there yeah yeah okay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay I'm Tommy is coming so know that you're you are coming to a breakthrough and it's going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two rights you almost have to feel it\nI feel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm ... and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\n... All right good luck brandy hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find wrong the Marines are these ... are more prevalent during the al ... or does it matter\n... [laughter] doesn't it\nDoesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think well it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there um and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now it's I think Ron would say is probably\nConstantly Maureen what do you think of ...\n...

essentially ... and\nWhat better fundraiser than a hundred house or actually four hundred houses in the month of October for now want folks\nNot two or three but for us right now they're going to be spread out all through the on there and keep so [noise] yes uh three of them are actually in Keystone proper and then a Rushmore Cave and Russia mountain adventure ... with us or to present this year they're calling it contagion now we've got a sneak peek about the other day\nUm I'm really excited about that now I'm a big guy had those in radio land can't see me but I'm pushing six six and we won't talk about the other dimensions here but\nUh I don't like type passages hits a scary thing or a and then when he would just add monsters to that it just kind of gets to be a overwhelming so he has a grown adult ladies [laughter] and that's how my wife that thank you very much grown adult what's her first name my my wife yeah Mary\nMary ... let's Mary that's grown adult and he's still get scared to well this is great how long have I have the uh um Saturdays association the holy ... says he shouldn't be doing things like this around Halloween\nWell this is our ninth season started or the very first year we went through a hundred house and said you know just be kind of a fun little fundraiser we were absolutely stoked to raise about three thousand dollars over the weekend online and then since then it's just grown exponentially last year we raised\n'em or gross revenue over the eight nights of the event for over Seventy five thousand dollars towards our charity\nAnd so it's it's definitely are big fundraiser it's the biggest fundraiser I'm of the year and you know after we get done paying for the events you know we it's it all goes back into the community tell us some of the things that you do with the money in the community\nWell like I said I'm One thing I can think of it right up the top of my head was a couple of years ago the schoolhouse museum where we have one of our hunting events needed a new roof and we helped to pay the difference on the\nA very large deductible that we had to meet on that a city couldn't quite Hackett and so I think we paid close to ten thousand dollars towards that and so yeah it just little things like that now I'm just you know filling the need wherever the need may arise um\nWe've had folks who you know got in an accident and needed some ... ... we never give cash but what we do is we'll call up the propane company and say hey\nFill up these folks the tank or the power company have let's keep the lights on for them at least another month here on earth just giving them a little bit of a hand up they're not looking for him now but a hand up there and that's all right\nNow what are the dates this year for the hunting throughout Keystone [laughter] so we're going to run at three weekends I we're starting this Friday the twelfth which by the way I've heard that the weather is going to be majority of the weekend I'm very nice for the middle of a middle of October in South Dakota especially so starting friday the twelfth and Saturday the thirteenth\nAnd then the weekend after that we start running friday through Sunday night nineteenth twentieth and twenty first and then the weekend right before Halloween the twenty sixth through the twenty eight we don't run actually on Halloween unless it falls on a weekend because we are\nCompletely volunteer based and we have a lot of kids that help out with this and ... which kind of have to go where the school nights are\nWell that sounds like a fun thing you need to email us solve the who what where when life so I could put it up on the Internet and I'll share it and that would be cool and look at talk about it on the air in the morning and afternoon shows here\nIn the meantime I'm all those details are available on the hunting Keystone dot com K. a hunting a Keystone dot com is also where you can get your tickets for this um I always recommend to people to get that ahead of time um you know there's a whopping whole fifty cent transaction fee on that but boy I tell you to avoid standing behind a hundred people trying to make change\nThat fifty cents is absolutely worth it so that's had hunting oh he's still dot com right hunting of Keystone dot the information\nThere I'll copy it over and we'll make sure that we promote there too that's what and it's not that far away for your city folks here and it's right okay it's not just go down you know hang out in Rockville for ten minutes and then hand on down the snow but says that'd be great so this is good how long have you been involved with it it is\nA sense a very good go how it was I guess the idea of myself in a couple of other people a nine years ago who said hey we should do something this is you know I've always loved Halloween and just a good outlet for that for a version\nA lot left to see if I can get a group of people would come down and that'll be great sells\nTickets are just ten dollars attraction for you know one of the hundred houses or you can also get a wristband for thirty dollars to get into all four and the cool thing about the wristband is that it also gets you a fair on the bus that we have chartered between Russia mountain adventure park and the rest of the attractions and keep them\nSo yeah that that's kinda nice just to be able to hop on a bus go down there come back up\nAnd you can park it either location you know if you're coming up from Rapid City sometimes people want to park at rush mountain they've got a huge parking lot down there or this time of year you know mostly unused and so parking and Keystone does kinda get crowded so there's another approach to it for you\nThere is a protein from the ... yeah yeah the un oaks hunting him to still going on and the holy a\nTear days association takes care of this is\nIt raises money for different projects around Keystone civic public people in need of different things\nAnd like so that's a good that when you said it was\nA real said you guys they handled the detective on that saved the city and in the museum and everything it quite a quite a bit of money so I think that's absolutely fabulous that's all about being community helping each other lifting each other up absolutely you know set of pushing everybody that we loved each other and get in anything else we need to share\nJust uh I always tell people get there early how we do everything we can to get you through the lines but with the success of the event we simply just can't guarantee that you're gonna get through all four of the events in one night\nUp I Will say that wristband if you do get that is good for any of the night so say you come on a friday and only get through to the events are three of the events bringing back the next night come back up and you can go through the other ones um as long as the\nWristband isn't marked off you can still go through the other ones

was anything but a legally spends\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now leads a page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learn this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office hate being the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then ignite or or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nAnd he's the night and it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now and say\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse is over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional has forced interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath he's refusing to do so\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McCain Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signs of the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to warrant you know that as an affidavit in career law enforcement's swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the fight the applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the dot CA was bony and made up and even its own author\nOf couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say in things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in ... when the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit ... a law especially a fight the application of five to warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all have that Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should wind up a hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that young people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peter Struck tech confirmed that there is no there are there\nBut anyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same stores which is Hillary is bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out and appointed buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption the ... school was now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak\nTo the Senate Judiciary committee ... sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why what it actually under oath where then he could be charged with lying

Warner robins I too am this morning near Augusta tomorrow morning and near and south and the track for instance ah looks like wind gust\nAre going to be a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia probably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour and middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are probably going to be between\nSixty and eighty miles an hour or nearing southeast of Augusta and in Columbia I'd say fifty five Seventy five year in southeast of there so the track of this by tomorrow night\nUh will take it or to take it probably a north the Fayetteville North Carolina and then two AM in the morning it reaches the or reaches a lizard at city North Carolina and then it goes out so that's how we're expecting this to move\nA over the next twenty four to thirty six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nLet me go through this a little bit more first of all I mean the the governor's saying I Hope to God that nobody said then people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case I mean I'm looking at some of these images and it's it's downright scary flooding has already occurred and in some of these coastal areas\nUm but the the these are the types of wins that could blow down houses correct and and structure\nI ... I suspect you're not seeing any any uh video coming in from where this made landfall ... I mean it's one thing for instance the Pensacola is on the west side of this and mobile Pensacola has had a wins out of the north forty ... sixty but it's blowing out\nSo it's at Panama City area a port saint Joe that's the area where it's ground zero and that uh you know if you told me structures and I'm not just talking about the you know a small structure I'm Talking about uh you know Camille took apartment buildings out along the beach show\nEither saying this storm Joe is the most powerful on record ... ever hit the Florida Panhandle\nRight between mobile in Tampa this is the most powerful on record nerd you know that that also goes west to mobile enough Camille once you get ... you get Camille in nearby pass Christian and those places that are Camille the benchmark storm there and done and Charlie down south of Tampa\nOr the benchmark storms there of course Andrew in Miami\nOr they're Nineteen twenty six was a bad storm along the coast but it was only a category tore up near Pensacola no this is this is the worst the worst storm now when we get a law both to the east of the tracks severe weather tornadoes are going to break out tonight or tomorrow and we're talking on southern and eastern\nWhen you get used to track your talking now about those Georgia but it's going to be a little south of Atlanta a direct kind of hit at eighty a hundred miles an hour I'm guessing into Augusta\nOh well no I think I think Augustus is sixty to eighty maybe Ninety miles an hour they'll back off by them making making like I said it may get gusts as high as that South west Georgia where it's going to be entering in a couple of hours they're going to be seen with a hundred hundred and twenty miles an hour and\nGot in there I mean that that's phenomenal because you've got to understand both as powerful as these things are when they get inland fractional effects\nOr it's almost like if you if you're running a nine one a sprint nine one one hundred yard dash if you tweak your hamstring if you can't run that fast if you really pull it you can't run at all well these things are perfect machines\nBut once they get inland the functional affects the fact that they're moving away from the source of energy the water they ... they wind down but we're talking about a relative winding down how many times as a ... the Georgia get when sitting here hurricane force from a storm that hit all the way down or close to three hundred miles or two hundred and fifty miles to the southwest\nTorn addict activity you got to make sure we covered for that eastern eastern Georgia eastern South Carolina in eastern North Carolina\nAnd these tornados as as a storm winds down in the low levels still very strong in the upper levels so what happens is that discrepancy create these border see these\nOnes and twos and so you get these higher costs with that and you have tornadoes it wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple of dozen tornadoes tonight into tomorrow in the area south and east and and so so the rainfall I'm Sorry I'm On\nYou know just about misinformation out it's like there's so much coming in and I can't\nCan't get it out here are the rainfall three to six locally twelve inches off from a room where we are in Georgia in a bar in Georgia now but ... South Carolina to North Carolina and a lot of that area that was devastated by Florence other coastal areas\nProbably aren't going to get it as bad they are going to get\nPretty strong wind gust in there but this is just inland until we get to Elizabeth City and you folks in tide water very late tomorrow night and on friday morning you're going to get north winds coming in their sixty ... Seventy miles an hour right now Chesapeake Bay because there's this reaches the coasts\nAnd those same personal effects I'm Talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay a male be there'll be a nor'easter from a DC to to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have a tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell the south and he has south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia or to Greenville Spartanburg I think ah to Raleigh Durham\nSo the tide water of Virginia you live south and East that path and the further south east to go the more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings\nBe put into effect in those areas and ah over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out of putting that out in Europe they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into friday yeah\nNow I Want to just go through those very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is it pounded hard the the pan\nAll of Florida and it's now moving northeast and as it moves north east is going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their us through it's going on\nA hundred miles a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty two hundred and\nNot get regulatory then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the northeast coast to the Carolinas I guess through the tip of Columbia through all the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City Chu I Am in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east and North Africa in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glancing blow a a you know it'd be like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours\nOr New Jersey on into south east New England out of this and this is the last this was the last one showing so you don't have to worry\nThese wind gusts are swirling all over and they're causing a lot of have a good thing is we have not seen a lot of people on the road just sheriff's deputies [noise] ah they're making sure people are okay people here are hitting the

an open borders bill and by the way President Trump's been very clear on this last couple of edge Democrats in the Senate every single Democrat on the Senate\nHas co sponsored the Feinstein open borders bill so now what the Democrats are proposing to us as a following we're going to have open borders so anybody who wants to can come in and offer them free health care for those talks now just you know apply your commonsense\nWorldwide among billions of people weren't going to go out within days\nIf you have an illness get our phone yeah they want to take care of you I mean how many people do we think are going to show up who need health care well what if\nYou don't have health care and you live in Alabama or you live in Missouri or you live in Michigan or I wouldn't mind drive an hour to California if I needed to Syria significant health care who's going to pay for it now they know income tax so entertaining\nThought about that that's a great idea I never thought about the notion [noise] [laughter] I Apologize screw you set it\nWherever I remember very dark actually way of thinking go ahead\nNo no no no I haven't perhaps I've you know this is one of those times when you take it just totally off my feet and it hadn't occurred I Am not going to write new some Klan could apply to every American so what we can say that regardless of the country is one of the California just gather\nOn a ship them out there for your time is on you know middle of the health care costs for every other state in the union everybody gets sick out to California Gavin Newsom offered you a free or something\nIs going to save every state in America\nI don't know I I I never thought I'd I gotta I gotta think Arthur Sean this by the time I Do your show tonight they're going to be in you're going to be able to go and that's when you go to work on the property totally off guard by the you know it's\nNot easy to get through getting rich off guard I won't say that I'm actually you know there aren't there have been times in\n... but you know you have warned me as the you know we're really family I've got to know you so well I consider you and your documentary your family and you know but\nYou know you're you're always you know quick to tell me you're out on a limb again you're out there in ... what are you doing here I Know you you don't have the tape is normally when you think I'm gonna do\nFar he wanders around now when I'm totally I'm Amazed you know what I Want\nI Want the country to when I'm not like a winning and I'm Glad we have ... million more Americans working ending burdensome rag regulation a champion energy independence for wall is being built if we can found the rest of it I'm I'm happy about you know all of the the renegotiate trade deals I think it's a more secure world\nAnd I ... I buy like this is exactly like the direction we're headed again I think we're better off than we were two years ago by a long shot\nWell that's what's amazing about the moment this moment in time as you know 'cause you know with the president last week and you know what what we're talking with a guy\nWho has kept his word and deregulation kept password on sort of judge just kept his word and cutting taxes kept his word on getting better trade deals and you look at the results you think yourself\nLowest African American history blow us Latino unemployment in history I think that down to what Nineteen sixty nine is the last time we were just good for everybody in general you know this\nThis is really working and what's the argument is that the fight this year was false and resistance and the president is focused on results and the Democrats are focused on our systems\nYou know I think that we have an opportunity here I just hope the American people are awake to what is at stake here\nAnd um you know I go through what the democratic agenda is and it is very dire to me and lives investigation they want to impeach the president\nThey want the the higher taxes even though Americans are seeing a thousand two thousand dollar extra dollars in their pocket every year that's real money for real people we're seeing manufacturing jobs coming back jobs we were told would never coming back\nWe see the the mid west grove now beginning a comeback that is his rival to none that we've seen in our lifetime\nAnd you know I just I see millions of Americans off of food stamps eight million off of poverty since Trump has become president this is real progress and maybe some people don't like the president's style but he's getting things done the disruption and the speed of Trump ... why would we go backwards\nWell that's right and I think there's a big challenge and the next few weeks it's for every single person\nWho wants to market to keep my direction\nTo make sure that they vote their friends vote everybody they no votes it's just because you know one of the violence is a long time ago elections on about polling elections are about who shows up I always tell people want to say well what do you think it's going to happen I say show me the first five or six percent\nWhen I see real Americans vote in a real precincts I Begin to think about okay I'm beginning to get the pattern and I think that a real a real shot here at the most historic mid term election of American history and I said it's very close\nIf this breaks the way I think it could it will be the most historic mid term election in American history and it will further accelerate the Trump revolution\nCreating jobs is defending America shaping the federal government draining the swamp stone and doing the things we need is a country being rushed to say or what have\nGot to take a break we'll come back we'll continue war with Newt Gingrich twenty seven days from election day and for weeks from today we'll be talking about those election results obviously we have big Senate races will last the speaker about that book continue to monitor what is now the the most powerful\nHurricane everyday Hitler the panhandle of Florida it's just named when now by a hundred and fifty five miles per hour borderline category five hurricane making its way\nThe ... and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five applications actually a warrant just like a search warrant in order to get fired a\nSearch warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true incorrect to the best of his knowledge and release a and that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out as an incorrect in there that person is going to face the consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know signed apple David together Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person wearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true\nAnd I'm affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal by the application and the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... of warrants\nWell that was based on the bone eight Clinton bought and paid for\nNot see aid that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated\nAnd has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath\nAnd a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews and those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail\nWhere there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more uh at the impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nInterview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that leads a page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation leads the page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we\nThere's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and flew on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure\nI tell you who's not measured at this particular point uh you've you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I could tell you got to people on the phone today\nJim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring them in and put them under oath\nI yeah I mean it and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed McKay memos and the kitten was and what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief capital a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have the McKay memos that reinforced that we've subpoenaed that McCain memos and we've ... assigned\nTo come in and answer a question neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr rather than it is leading that you played shot he he talked about trends that he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and our our our rule of law and justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the document give us those McCain memos and more importantly comments or our question that's what bothers both\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you a committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I was chairman Goodlatte in the room and in two or three other staffers we all agreed that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come in to a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come yet\nUh then we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more ... shoes on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of so\nWe're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and ...\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot of game plan now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states in the hopes that it would\nProvide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about our own set of sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you shouldn't that the guy who was in effect running dusted department should not be joking with support in about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that it is that even if it's a joke that's not something you do that particularly at the time that this was happening remembers not this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on a night the president fires gym called me on may seventeenth Rod Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\n\nMessy was ended by the south Dakota high school activities in South Dakota interest come I think I'm running for\n\nAT T O T H thirty degrees and [noise]\n\nWe continue with congressman Jim Jordan\nAnd congressman Mark Meadows All right so the next step then is what I mean do we do I need to give out the numbers of Trey Gowdy is office and chairman Goodlatte ball but since they call these men and demand that they pay you know under oath Rod Rosenstein why why I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant\nAnd three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWill hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone a brand new you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it your list and interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you\nThey need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important it is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today uh to\nTo stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much job in\nBus raises right in and say this is what I did this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the class of buying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein side have either have you seen that particular buys her application\nI had not a song we need to see that we need to see the notes that taken after every time roots or goes in and talks with the FBI remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with when Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person that the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we went to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve adult\nTo the so called real too as we need the those and remember when the president first talked about classifying well we'll ask him to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications for McCabe page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more importantly the American people need it\nOr do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please do oh two two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five\nFifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath\nOr thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your porch but the truth we need to get to the bottom of this\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we got a lot more to come down ... more on this also the latest on this hurricane that his pounding the Florida Panhandle as we speak hurricane Michael and much more Hannity tonight nine

reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days look\nThe hell out of great article today\nAbout what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive

all of this isn't that jeopardy dam bond you know\nI don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book you know the they attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it's a host at a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have a gym up this rage or might not\nAll of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Paul the rape it Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called treason they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the mid term what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this ... the psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that it's American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's faith and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting there hey follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ...

certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible or for Brett Kavanaugh bought the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic or the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nBrock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity\nIn modern American history and that is not just made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like what Kevin McCarthy introduce which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall or the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you need about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big\nIssues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as more and more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\n... and don't forget showing that the circuit and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell your most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individual moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and truck bed already had was uh twenty six appoint east of the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to the to be confirmed as well\nSo this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know that that could come up and if Trump wins reelection bid may come open\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if Ginsburg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open and it's a potential\nSix three conservative majority and the courts I mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not

program today has come true\nThis is a bad bad storm it's they're now in the middle of it and uh it's more devastating than we even thought it could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I uh you know and my dad used to always say I mean the if you have to tell somebody said something you must know set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually of that we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks\nThe first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so that you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come in fact I\nTalked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf War right now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up everything got together and that's why and you see that every once in awhile but let me put it in perspective I guess is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile camp I that I can find on records\nOkay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something hit worse so we're not I'm not sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your SUV All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up pretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years\nIncluding Harvey by the way that hit\nAt its peak Andrew did that ... that\nI was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off its peak most of these hurricanes and we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall as a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done\nThey may call it a category five I'm not sure they go out to go in and look at the damage but there's a lot more left of this storm folks because even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia\nNot our biggest one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour at ... you will escaped the worst of it but I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South Carolina just north of pay a bill by this time tomorrow when we're talking\nAnd then it will move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia very late Thursday night\nOn out to sea to the south of New England just be a glancing blowing the Ninety five quarter\nIn the mean time for you folks in the Carolinas All right you you're

before and numbers in Sunday that the angle at which the storm was coming in made it that much more devastating\nYeah again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all guns blazing as far as intensity goes and it's one of these cases where everything came together but you could see it coming together\nEven back on Saturday and Sunday as you

Senator Mike Rounds at today's focused featured guest and I asked senator around or what he sees concerning the future of the Fifteen will we get a chance to see that at our pumps maybe as early as this spring here's what he had to say\nI think in South Dakota and locations where ten or ... is popular today I think you will see a fifty and I think that's going to be a positive thing\nIn some other states matter of fact the majority of states around the country there's a time during the year in which they couldn't sell the the ethanol product because of environmental concerns which now have not been substantiated so we think that's a good thing to move forward really\nFor South Dakota going to a Fifteen I think I think we've got a real good chance of having that happen across state which is going to help a lot in terms of ethanol production of using it out that up\nBut second of all across the rest of the country in areas where they wouldn't put in the ... to begin with because they had to shut it down for several months out of the year for those folks this is a really good thing and there'll be able to bail out that all year round\nThat should a significantly increase the amount of ethanol salt across the country\nDo you think there's a chance that the oil industry is going to try to sue and lock this year round the Fifteen\nWent through and we looked at confidential

by by the law and people are innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and\nAnd we think that's important to send that message a and at the same time because we had a lot of people up here that we're very emotional and disposing um strong support for individuals foot made the accusations\nOf we had to make a decision was this going to be mob ruler was just going to be ruled by law

control clean drinking water and so forth um and and it means like put the dams how you go about construction on the dams how you go about soil erosion projects um but it also there are a couple of things that were really important to the south Dakota because we directed that\nThe secretary of the army would have to really hurry up and complete or expedite um their snow pack and moisture monitoring programs so that we have a better opportunity to understand exactly when we have real problems with regard to moisture in the\nIn the uh the the basin of the Missouri River they didn't have the the information the system set up in order to monitor her to make good projections on how much water is going to come through which is one of the reasons that we had the flood of you know the
