hours of the morning it back to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location they the lights on the call when I was on the cost us it and came to a halt\nOn and they should they should be coming down and say the vehicle interference phenomena with a new holiday what seemed tray again is that they\nThey are British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report it to the place I handed over to a group within the British royal Airforce cause cold they promised in security services are sort of like they\nBut James Bond they feel like a day of the royal Airforce that sort of get involved in Ashby an option counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the files he talks about how they ... they promised in the security services interviewed Ronald wild ... to\nWith a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most challenging and intriguing aspect\nA city called the police and they said that direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sad was just like you know the whole missing China angle of abduction law in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to is saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle and then\nHe kind of fell to bitch strange checked his watch and there was something about it it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact these and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of with the music meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos but the the more you read about him and the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen when you realize that these guys telling these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you\nHave a hard time taking them literally but when you realized that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts at Penn or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they conclude\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for following around people like a dam skied bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean Georgia ... is a first book flying saucers a blinded published in the early fifties\nThat that sold in huge Vegas how gigantic numbers of books with salt I'm On a dime ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly had this sort of a communist type\nOf governments and the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on our dams skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with highly and busts the FBI was more concerned as to how painful raiding his books and go into his lectures might be influenced by\nThe communist angle and I'm\nA number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example it again in the ... I have the theory of society preoccupied George King was closely watched 'em by the British a police force because\nGeorge King Lear the area society but very much I'm On the nuclear weapons on so falls were opened on them so in other words you actually have files open on the contact taste but predominantly because they had this political salons\nOr in many of back claims but at the airport and thing is\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to the FBI and the other agencies were opening serve islands files on pay for who climbed close encounters um with non human entities\nAre you in a report in the book that's coming out in the first of November\nTop secret alien abduction files your work something that I had read before on a very famous case a ... ... on the news this is an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and\nUh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance through a whole different level heal that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional around\nAspect of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil by this young man named Tony ... claim to be taken onboard a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd I'm I'm for all kinds of ... he was hiking on board against his will show he was abducted you know it wasn't I mean abduction case I'm within you follow Jay you know it's hard to say this being\nA wishful thinking on the part of Antonio village spouse or you know it was a really\nWeird aspect of the phenomenon now deceased little I'm known aspect to to the story or which places and entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio ... a report that he put together for um\nA Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named the love of funds has um he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down on these started to fail where they say the same drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard spacecraft which you described as being sort of long rectangular\nOn um he had like something on TALK like a dish that were spinning around very fast and he was making a Beijing noise and I kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the the shape\nThe spinning disk on top the roaches and the ... noise says like the classics how'd you get with a helicopter\nEven cooler slightly around forty nine degrees\nAnd then by Thursday we'll see more clouds building in the area and also expect some rain showers as well with high is driving back to forty six\nFriday and Saturday we still expect on and off rain showers and temperatures dropping back to forty two friday but then warming right back up to forty six on Saturday and we couldn't even see some mixed breeds habitation otherwise we should expect overcast guys in the late afternoon\nI'm staff meteorologist Jeff ... for news radio K.

I don't think I think it is sort of um\nYou know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\nIn most papers and government don't know anything about it at all because he might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it might have been even sort of farmed out to private corporations which again would make it more\nDifficult to get material for the fame Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by\nA by the fate of information request so in that sense I think you know the the phenomena and Israel and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of violence to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there are so many cases of black helicopters and ... helicopters to an NGO mayor Holmes sometime precariously there the homes I bailing out duct tape and I can kind of light with college entering drag\nBase might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct taste um and be able to her to respond at high speed a fit in a a\nEvent that they had the papal fly Matty cups as we're actually able to capture the abduction going ahead you know in the ... I was actually very time\nSomebody who's the tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the files to obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things that someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless he needs to be shed and if we're dealing with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages I'm\nSure that that includes the FBI stay classified files on constantly education's I'm a wave of and couch says that occurred in Seventy five and some of the ... and I'm border of the United states in in the

on the subject there's no\nSort of one hundred percent consensus on what actually happened it remains you know a mainstream but there are a lot of\nWeight aspects to this story which I guess I'm

that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the variances and and even after last year and he said and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how of belief\nIn church um formal religion organized religion as sort of limiting or around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality affects ah has has remained strong or human increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you said I was really how I began to book with the puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they at ... pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional religion with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world for 'em and spirituality and the apps are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm really I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter or dark energy or even thinking about\nInsanity a or thinking about the the multi or something about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with a car with offensive audit mystery and wander and think about those concepts are sort of\nUh the the bad for for new spiritual conception and I and I um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard times too late ignoring me George it's too late\nYeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting our head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities ... you know time slips things of that sort of that you get sort of reached out look\nAnd look for a way to maybe make a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talked about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts the even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nI think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about\nOther dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talked to a bit about\nI talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for her for the listeners and I guess you know go for another demand the idea of another dimension of not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or\nDimensions read spatial dimensions that we live in and not links with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about it\nFourth mentioned um since Einstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world an Einstein I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talked about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension of space that different from the other three so now we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper up a line of a one dimensional object as lying if you then draw flats where on that same piece of\nPaper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw Cuba I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else as a as a direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimensions reality is it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by mass mathematicians and and actually others from philosopher I'm not\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] and they find that they buy incorporating an extra spatial dimensions\nFour spatial dimensions that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equation for clean or they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to get ... today today and you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are\nYour members of our audience her string theory but sure yet I'm using their string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that Governor governor in the universe their string theorists in um\nTheoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that we have two sets of equation that seemed to govern reality\nUm and we know that both sets of equations are correct but we also know that they don't get together and have we we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor some atomic world with the er the atomic world world of ...\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and bonds and galaxies on 'em and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of two Asians are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the Weinstein Ian version and the London version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which of scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a\nMathematician who who work on on these subjects\nAre also have to wrestle with other mystery is right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know\nThey're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem with having two separate equations that don't fit together and they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other um strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics\nThat um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I tried to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is about scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm\nA scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them is higher dimensional or or somehow related to some some concepts and says I\nOr maybe we could use flat land as a illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nSpirituality and science and where to get into a couple of the examples and how they got through it you're just a moment when it goes to

about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds when our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it and you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting in their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views on his door\nYeah yeah yeah he lost his life is is quite a story um but you're right they're they're hinting and there's many others in the book Cruz sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious and a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and excuse me and\nI don't want you to find them wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher to mention that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nThe um you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality ... an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he he embraces map Madison geometry as a kind of a he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that is the way in which the map provide certainty onto him\nBut I think of his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions than he is very\nInterested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts thinking oh well what if what if these mathematical variables in my equation you know the higher the higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence\nOr somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he developed over way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the fences in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educated in the sense of that involves um no it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and then they're stocked up into like a ... you know three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the position of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nAre essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was a he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing a research but instead he he was doing things like putting this is talk of the Q A few obsessed together and helping coach the prince and baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching garbage as one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices I'm ever invented so he does that and so he didn't get tenure prints and he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that you know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these\nYou know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to uh\nA new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are seeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nAs well as you document and trace I mean this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a free ... and I I Would uh think con men religious leaders who grab onto a do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd Hitchens ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course and flat land both both of their um\nYou know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people and the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book the chapter seven\nDone and the only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah I think that's the kind of questions that you as a professor of religious studies not all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it doesn't taste it lays out these big philosophical issue right like um fate and destiny and human free will and how free or we can make choices on and so on\n'em so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know\nI'm I think what ... what's happening is that you know the fact that these teacher moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dream in itself could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say are four dimensional world right to exist re spatial dimensions than one temporal dimension dreaming southeast that can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein year and a bit of you know Hinton and higher space philosophers there I'm\nWhat he believes will happen and somehow the dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as a as as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that as you know maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom\nBut that's what he thought and have you thought everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bad of their dreams and they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contained bits and pieces of future events and pass it on a sort of mixed up together\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it\nStill say anti Semitic words of hate after he was wounded and captured you know faces dozens of charges state and federal due in federal court later today\nProsecutors say they do want to seek the death penalty also due in

migrants but that could still be months off off the coast of Indonesia is capital there's a major search and rescue effort underway\nFurther Mr jetliner that crashed into the job a few minutes after

you don't have to pay the entire amount you owe the program at total financial freedom can help you get dead free and months instead of decades get off the debt treadmill and stop the harassment\nI think that's what they're doing I think you know just like Jay W Don Wright who had the dream team to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible that point figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to ... he went to\nSort of popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I Try to make in the book but I think a lot of us are sort of been fired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept I'm In\nI mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example reaching out to some invisible world there I'm absolutely yeah I Know the remote viewing yeah\nYeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you write them people who've been trying to to reach the transcendence uh ever since there have been humans on earth right or read reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity on\nAnd we talked about dreams earlier I think your dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans is psychedelic drugs to open up what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there are all different\nAll different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that does that make sense because of the idea of other worlds fire dimensions as\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about ... viewing and other a pair liking one on one arm and I am has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know an flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of that very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat land let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat where sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle and he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land\nCan just see a one dimensional wind but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of this two dimensional world\n... up into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly a he suddenly have powers a vision that he never had right he can look down at five times you can see for the first time\nNot just lines but he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see you can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines he can see all of their dimension you can see even inside reading let's say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle\nOn all the saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the trial you could see inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have uses to say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness pop into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we can look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision so um\nYou know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to a higher dimension we would look back on our world and what would we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out now you could see the insides of every one's body you could see the outside that are run by you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nAnd so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing I um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they\nTalk about having this kind of um having this kind of special dish right where they can see things I never saw before so so yeah and it's a maybe a remote viewing his uh uh you know he has a higher dimensional phenomenon I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it I'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and and the epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some her hair psychological phenomena like like remote viewing\nYeah Raymond Moody is uh somebody I met in a ... interview and it's just you know he's a trailblazer and in discussing that those experiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context and this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those extra\nYeah yeah I I I looked at his his book to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book um I looked at his books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the I Belong to the book and that's the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found\nIs that people do use this kind of language you know they it's almost like they talk like the square and flat land as as a character you know the characters suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um you know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and others talk about being able to see\nLike in a hospital setting right and if someone had an ear that the writer in a hospital setting others talk about rising up above the hospital setting and being able to see it's a different route I'm In the hospital so once again or another case in which\nUm you know you're you're raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have this incredible powers a vision that you didn't have before you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um\nSo yeah people people in Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do sometimes use the language of higher dimension to talk about what they experience\nNot to say on says the same category but you do a address say on this and if people's attempts to reach a\nHigher power or an another world um you know\nWhat's going on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or or do you not want to pass judgment on\nYeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because I've never had any of these experience [laughter] yeah I've never had a dream that\nExperiences that other people are having\nYou know and I try to put him play their voices and and how they understand what's happening\nOn but I don't I don't know about finances you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah\nAnd amazing really that than we now are you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the eye on\nYou know I I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from fight I mean when you when you look at these or\nDoes this is a cosmologist and read their read their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publication I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there is no way that anyone could have an experience like that\nSo I guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would count as happened in and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book the book it has all of these big questions um you know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about\nSpirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibilities are on the personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we go to after this world me personally I Am a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I Would line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities on like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there who have different opinions and and write the reader kind of decide what they say you know

higher dimensions of it as a\nAs a dimension of consciousness right I'm In and you definitely have this and\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young ... and many others um you know when we talk about there being re spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's like it's going in and you know it's not going out

it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and run the census has a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle you\nGot a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camp and back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is and we have British since team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on and that is going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people's tendency ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall holds but people have got to get out the vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is down by double digits she also was exposed by project or a toss up we now have\nIn a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat\nAnd only the only factor there that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing votes away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly we've done a whole the steep\nHeller seat in

inviting the attorney for the blind shake to Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven I was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us that's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nIdeas Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states\nWe knocked on a million nine hundred seven thousand two hundred twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not there were accounting and as of this weekend five point eight million if the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had an a fifth term election\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide ear\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats are two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are advised to people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education and literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignored the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nEverybody me you know I make a living for people not ignoring your except it okay but I think you're right\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman and Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor in that state in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen he won by five\nThey were only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election we're turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean I talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every targeted than in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races\nThird down to is the U.S twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the pole and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelical for pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got emails on about half of a week\nWe have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us ... tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power\nBut then I say that and I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them could tip the balance of power and while you use the polls that it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right now we really see the houses on the bubble we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now a hundred seats in play\nAnd probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and what you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had off off you know two three four five in the last five four\nAll a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins\nWho loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters directly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential Chavez shocking an election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shock the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally what I read the exit polls at five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and at that moment reading the exit polls Trump lost Florida last North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he lost Michigan the last was constantly last at all\nI Need barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls the five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and they don't pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nYou're shooting survivor Barry worker who hid in a storage closet during the shooting what did we do\nTo this man why is that why why did he decide to\nDo

constitutional making ... el ... they are in bed with the Venezuelan and laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet on their role in organizing a posting videos and pictures from the more\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist on any\nIn effect the giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad and our allies look that\nWell I mean look the American doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people that the and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment for Zena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check you out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with us and the stuff in the city has nothing to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures carrying the stone simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nWhy the way those folks of people who don't want to control the border why is it good only people who can walk you should be allowed to getting your status but if that's the principal\nOr when I'm On this I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be\nGiven the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and\nSadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring all tar\nBut I agree you're going to do something we don't want anybody hurt and also it it was undoubtedly true but most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S up on the look probably been lied to you from the beginning I'm told that when they get to the war will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being put in the middle of this I'm simply use hub of really as human shields on harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that that you know what I really feel sorry for people are taking the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built\nUm either I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence and on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd apartment on that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there I think look dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety there\nWithout question of what you've just described age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who have more control the water that we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here\nBecause that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion and we obviously cannot do\nWe have to maintain control of horrible yeah\nAll right we'll really really appreciate Sam thank you eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program and we got to take a break right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up and it's election that we have coming up well\nIt's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings or tax savings that on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your ... that is also on the ballot and if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist Cindy seat or you you want to preserve the

four one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\nOh yeah right out of a media man\nDoing [noise] is Sean Hannity show [noise]\n\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American lives destroying broken\nI'm already know Simon and I just mentioned [noise]\nI glad you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour on there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrowed it down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point actually thirty races kind of like well we have but\nThey got that they have a feisty race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked in a two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seeds and that means that Republicans will retain the house to control the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians ... can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest polls beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exact even five forty six all\nNelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRounded Sanders has coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nLatest stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was once twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll in West Virginia where mansion is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seen as very weak and could be the big surprise of the night both\nWest Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district filled Charlie Dent empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nNow say that Sean first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to feed the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue is to me are simple what we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it\nOpen borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say worked for great health care for all and make it sound wonderful just like you know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's led hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got British sent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they planned to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing in the case of Tennessee you got reticence that polling people Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in God\nI absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day Democrats they everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch the camps the passer angry because it's Sean\nAnd but let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixty and when the media had two snares out there one of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump's do want\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out\nContrast that to two thousand made more was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to ... midterms think about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now what part of the Trump success story do the voters want to change give the crumbs back\nIncrease the regulator watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some people in November six\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing close these Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district a million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in the high value in Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody I said they're foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for below sea they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show or in the district\nTo punch back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and wherever and we're gaining momentum uh we've we've debated several times I made and every debate she will not to agree to any additional debates how we caught her actually listen as we caught her in the debates talking about\nSupporting open borders actually correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border twice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she must walk running on a volunteer eyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going to expose her for what she really is ...\nAll those are the really important race a now Marty no Stein is running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district\nVolley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spend as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election boards you know there's so many presidential election is what they told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned in so people are really really engage the really engage\nHe's getting any orders feedback as to you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you the people who I've been meaning and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes and I have a good sense\nThere's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls it'd be a lot of them they're going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda you know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last two years I've given a lot of people hope in this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean\nThey one pops they want freedom and liberty than when opportunity that's what we want as what we have and we must continue it\nOr we wish you the best Marty all the best thing I Know you bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district to Pennsylvania and Lehigh County uh we'll be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak out\nYes sir thank
