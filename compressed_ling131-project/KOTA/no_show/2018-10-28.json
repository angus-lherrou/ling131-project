to our podcast a delivery\nUniverse a okay this item and you know we often talk about the consequences of the twenty sixteen election which was a surprise even to supporters of Donald Trump or it was it was a big shock that he actually won and a lot of people were were devastated\nAnd so research was undertaken recently to see to what extent people had long term psychological consequences as a result of the U.S presidential election race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton\nAnd what they concluded was\nThat since the election cause symptoms often seen in those with PATS deep post traumatic stress disorder no qualification this was done in San Francisco State University which is one of the bastions of\nLiberal thinking\nBut they found that twenty five percent of students surveyed cross the threshold which indicated quote clinically significant levels of stress\nThe average dressed scores of students who is comparable to the scores of witnesses to to a mass shooting seven months after the event\nSo a\nFemale scored about forty five percent higher than males on the assessment and of course this is a no brainer Democrats scored more than two and a half times higher than Republicans\nAre so uh\nYou know called as a science or pseudo science um but uh there are some demonstrable long term sick Wiley of the presidential election but still affect a substantial amount of our populous\nAnd particularly certain young people ah who feel that this was a devastating outcome and uh may suffer P. T. S. D. like symptoms long term\nEight seven seven Seventy six eight to five five is our number and this item and speaking of pie TST in the military the big problem PATS D a is a big budget buster\nAnd the Veterans Administration 'cause a lot so these are returning a GIs suffer from P. G. S. D.\nAnd uh the problem has been taken up in a may news articles and in fact many uh movies in popular culture and so it's well known that the TST as prevalent among military veterans\nSo\nWhat they discovered is that there's an unusual contributing factor to PBS D\nWhich is the use of energy drinks energy drinks are huge in the military because\nObviously a alertness is at a premium and sometimes the hours are long you can imagine a a a a troops in the field\nA or a\nFighter pilots on missions they have to maintain alertness during long periods of monotony and sometimes we sleep deprivation so they actually encourage energy drinks they deliver pallets of energy drinks to troops on bases and troops were deployed\nAnd so they did a survey and they found that a sixteen percent of soldiers in this study a reported continuing to consume two or more energy drinks per day in the ... in the post deployment period a more than Seventy five percent of soldiers consumed energy drinks\nBut the surprised with the people kept drinking him long after the point you're 'cause their hook it there's tons of caffeine in there and um they have names like rip it off in ...\nFor two overseas as quote crack it provides the immediate jolt service members look forward as like physical and cognitive performance and so they did a study and study\nUh found that um\nI keep finding was the mental health problems I depression anxiety TST an alcohol misuse were strongly associated with high levels of energy drink use\n'em 'cause these these energy drinks they just jangle your nerves are the data from the study also suggested energy drink used as strongly says he was in grad student behaviors\nAnd aggressive behaviors they say can be problematic because of the link to risky behaviors and unhealthy habits relationship problems intend to harm others and suicidal behaviors\nAnd oh by the way the big take home message and this is important this is important\nTo energy drink use was associated with\nReady for this fatigue\nHas not because the people were fatigued and then they use the energy drinks to alleviate fatigue but more energy drinks people used more fatigued there were\nSo um they say this finding standard contracts with the marketing of energy drinks wage increase energy reduced fatigue\nUm news outlets in lawsuits have challenged where there is such claims are valid but our findings use of the study authors call into question we often cited rationale for using energy drinks which is usually the fatigue like they ultimately it's like\nYou know using a plastic you know to buy things with you know if you expand your credit you end up\nWith a negative balance and negative balance the cash the analogy negative balance in energy you just keep pushing down pushing them pushing down an accelerator and ultimately\nYou're going to be depleted\nSo they say energy drinks may lead to an increase in mental health problems aggression and fatigue\nAnd uh this is an issue that needs to be addressed in the military but also think of her young people because they just loved jug or those energy drinks that ultimately\nMay undermine their physical and mental health\nEight seven seven Seventy six eight to five five is our number and you're a more reasonable way to address\nEnergy\nIs something that's not going to jangle your nerves or give you a a caffeine like effect I'm Talking about the only national formula clinically proven to reduce fatigue whatever the cause whether it be age illness or just being run down\nIts energy factor from nutritional therapeutics now in the factor works on the mitochondria which are the actual energy batteries within cells and they've done the research clinical trials have shown anti factor reduces fatigued by almost half\nWe've heard me talk for a long time about pro packs within the factor that's a one stop shop for your vitamins mineral needs but while ago I suggested in traditional therapeutics that some people may want to keep their multi and or fish oil and yet still harness the power of empty factor so healthy aging was born\nWith a British company ...

ball up stick them in a little while a packet and then since it over to what's called the license all the breaks it down\nSo it's a healthy cells queen themselves up and if they don't do this with fish and we all those bad proteins that are dysfunctional accumulate and it is so ... so rich the aging process and the salt\nSo we're looking at ways to slow down the aging process at an intra inside the so level now and so by using form ... which are yet to be developed at federal we may be able to prevent and improve the cleansing so they live longer to go to the unique methods\nI Would say yeah you would come up with such good things and we've got Kevin Murphy on with us now can Murphy is a former Wall Street managing director city group high school and collegiate wrestling champion\nCommunity activists speaker coach and author of a new book called the three rooms now his experiences have given them a unique an eclectic mix of understanding human nature which he's used to put into this book which is\nQuite that seemed a little different than some of the books and authors we've had on\nI Love the he stepped away from his corporate world to really focus on this the three rooms itself the book and like you to start the process of better monitoring your thought because we all know that are thought had so much to do with our health our wealth and our relationships welcome to the show cabin\nHow you describe yourself it leads to a lot of things like we're not going to be able to achieve your dream while I'm not going to be able to do that and that causes more stress and anxiety you know and you know from a medical standpoint you know you guys are aware that you know every start releases a chemical\nAnd when you're feeling stress and is releasing you know cortisol into the body and it's going down to the hormonal system and that message it back to the brain to produce more\nStruck equal to those emotions now people are starting to feel stress all the time they're really getting stuck in the future up and they're just going around and around and they don't realize it and so you have to monitor how you're feeling you if you think your feelings Josh\nI'm feeling anxious that's the first thing is like an alcoholic saying you know I have a drinking problem well I have a structural problem\nAnd and you become addicted to stress just as you can become addicted to alcohol their jobs and so you need to be aware of that and then you can start to do things to bring you back into the president\nI always look at my dog yeah uh he doesn't worry about tomorrow [laughter] through the living in a moment in the\nMoment is like can we go play ball I just wanted to he doesn't worry the boats going to happen tomorrow is needed to be met one way or the other and I should think more like he does\nYeah I mean it is true the animals seem to get it right there are some animals that stress\nWell they can I mean but you know all these animals were aren't aware of their own mortality no true right so the problem they don't know the problem here as usual where you're going to die [laughter]\nRight and this is all your struggles [laughter]\nAnd then you worry about what am I going to do in the future to prevent me from dying or what happens when I die or what about\nYou in the past has only made me so unhealthy\nInvolve yourself so that's why everybody gets up get dolled up and goes to church on Sunday says helped me deal with the fact that I have a mortal and I'm going to die\nAnd this is Dr Anderson view of the world [laughter]\nNot necessarily the same news the other members\nActually died you know doctor and if it makes a really great point\nOn that [laughter] so\nThink about what he just checked out a catch you know rolling into how you can do that all day long you can throw that ball that bring it back and you throw it again will get the ball and bring it back it's just having a catch ... to ... in a moment and that's all it's focused on\nAnd there's something about it just having a catch with someone because you have to focus right that you can't be looking the other way the ball hit you went ahead and so it is that act of giving\nThrowing the ball and then receiving getting it back and the focus and attention on being in the project so there's something about that just that catch and the fact that animals especially you know like a dog who they are just in a moment and they are worrying about things and thinking of\nWorst case scenarios and you know in the future and so they don't get stuck in the road\nAnd it's like a father and son playing catch was a baseball there in the momentum whatever problems there have been worried they're not\nThinking about it at that time and\nI think that's why dads have such fond memories of playing catch with their sons ooh that's probably true\nWould not agree more oh you guys you know\nWe've got to agree that come on [laughter]\n[laughter] I got to earn what Lucy [laughter]\nThese rules apply to business and in work life because I think that they are applicable in bowls\nAre absolutely I mean you know from a business perspective you constantly be looking back at what you did wrong and being hungry about the decisions that you made in the past um you're just never going to move forward and and and you can look into the future and worrying about what\nOther people are doing and and how you're never going to be able to do this and how you know what am I going to you know what are we going to do to you know to get ahead of you have to be planning right now and in\nThe present room it's not about not planning for the future but it is a matching the future\nAnd visiting you know what she would like to happen in the future and then\nGet treated as if it's already happened or if you've already accomplished at and then you go from that point and now you start to do all the things is necessary to get you to that point because you've already invasion than imagined where you want to be\nAnd that's a huge difference between worrying about the future and causing stress whether it's in a business like join our personal lives\nOr matching the future we want to have and then living from that moment and living with the joy of knowing that it's already been created it hasn't manifested yet or you haven't gotten there yet but it's already done and you're working backwards\nI mean that's what all the great visionaries in business have done\nYeah they use narrow linguistics and that's part of a girl linguistics you know put the pathways there so then the action can follow okay I'm willing to use your the things I learned in your book this rerun ... I'm going to apply them to how patients can use them for longevity and I want to see if you think I got it right okay\nSure All right so here's what I think we have a patient come in and you've just given them new uh maybe it's a new diet or knew a lifestyle that they need to do because maybe they are pre diabetic will just say their pre diabetic\nMay have three choices when they leave they can spend time in the past grim and they could be you know sad that they did all these things that have gotten them to that point\nAnd and maybe even lose sight of what they can be doing now\nTo prevent the diabetes or they can live in the middle room to room that you that you say we got to live and the president ramp say what can I Do right now to better my health what choices can I make or they can live in the future room which could at times be good because they need to legalize themselves being healthy or\nNaked instead be living in the future him in a bad way saying I'm going to start next week I'm going to start doing this later because\nI'm not going to do it right now but I'll I'll maybe start maybe a New Years so this is a good application to to what you're trying to teach us\nYeah that's that's a pretty accurate I Would I Would say in the future um it's even a little bit worse it's not you know what more is never going to work or I'm not going to get healthy or I'm never going to have the money it really looking at a worst case scenario and match\nCausing the strategy and the president room and not so much thinking what can I Do to you know it'd be better in the future\nImagining all ready for that or what is it that I Would like and then what do what do you like to have that\nAnd how would it be you know\nWhat what is still like to have already accomplished that already be healthy yeah why don't you know I Want to be healthy whether you want to lose X amount of town or you want to get your blood pressure down whatever that is from Ashley in a health perspective I think about already eating healthy\nYou know all those in spontaneous remission that we're hearing about now\nAll of them did a couple of things that they they all have in common whatever it is a belief that there's a power greater than them back into your body right and the other is that they're already coming from a place of ... and that's when you bring it up at genetic and thought actually changed but you know the health and your body\n[noise] yes uh I had a investment banker once who was headed for retirement was basically a blob of fact he was on motivated he was depressed he didn't care about anything\nHe came in we pointed this all up to him he replied very softly and then to my surprise and delight he changed his complete life around in one year he lost sixty pounds started working out he developed motivation he counseled his retirement he was very very successful that's awesome yeah\nI Do like ... patients like that do they make you go to this is why I'm a doctor yeah yeah it was just terrific you have any like attitude patients that that you go this would success story\nYou know I don't I Can't recall any health on my head of the we're we're somebody the change that Germany for a lot of people that are\nUh make changes and uh usually two great motivators or fear ... to\nUh I don't think they turn arrive out and bought some people that have maybe gone from a work environment that when they do retire all of a sudden their health gets better I mean that you know the worst rush to work and when they read themselves with that drug such drugs but\nAlso they have more motivation and energy to spin towards the health it's almost like they're punishing themselves that they want to be unhealthy or work\nYou know I had an interesting

good thing for America so there's challenges in that it takes time to be ready it takes time to train\nA these are sophisticated new weapons systems that we have and and so for our part time soldiers and airmen um you know when you when you're dedicating\nA you know the old model of thirty nine days a year just doesn't apply anymore and I mean the the one weekend a month and two weeks a year is out there is is still the statutory requirements for a guardsmen for reservists but\nBut a really to be the combat force that we'd be coming in many pieces of our force it takes much more time much more training and folks are using fifty and sixty and Seventy days of training a year which is a challenge for us it's a\nChallenge for them but along with the ah the guards men and women that are

employee for a greater periods of time under this new strategy using the guard\nSo you know I I think a ... you've hit on on kind of the crux of it here so you know as the chief because of this

it those those four hundred and fifty thousand men and women who serve everyday a is a you know that that includes their families and that includes their employers are business model fundamentally

our from our ah our families out there another one might be um you know is a\nYou know there are some clearly that ah that question the hey this this is the reserve commitment and and sometimes you know family members are serving in the military tend to want to volunteer and deploy to go someplace and\nAnd uh they're doing deployments and they're doing very important things around the world for instance of a president's mission in the in the\nUh in the Pacific whether you're deployed to Thailand or whether you're deployed to the Philippines or whether you're deployed over there so that you can work with our allies and partners which is one of Secretary Mattis is\nPrime lines of effort inside the national defense\nStrategy is uh sometimes they don't see the connection between the importance of that strategic president's mission\nOr that might not be a in Afghanistan or Iraq which conveying to them the importance of what the role we play now is it's operational force across all missions that I'm not just engaged kinetic leap perhaps in in Afghanistan and Iraq\nThe military is having recruiting issues which was something that has been acknowledged by each branch of the service that has to do with a number of factors the stress put on by multiple deployments you've got a lack of physical fitness among the recruiting pool up how\nIs the guard at dealing with the military recruiting issue that that I assume it's facing you distance it's facing each other branch of service\nYou're exactly right Eric recruiting is a is really one of our top priorities uh right now and and that leads directly to reading is if you can't\nFill out your formations and find appropriate people who are fit and qualified and trained and ready to go\nThen you aren't part of the United States Army and forty nights are forced that they need and and so on the air side on the Air National guard this year we we exceeded are recruiting goals and we made the end strength the allocated to us by the air force\nI was curious to know how the relationship works between the D O D an individual states had wanted to find out the details of a specific program that builds ties between the guard the states and other nations\nWhat can you tell us about state partnership program what it is and how it benefits the guard in those states\nSo stay partnership program and it is indeed I think it's grown beyond the wildest dreams of those who started to twenty five years ago\nUm you know we have ah partners between individual states and and nations uh for anyone nations um and uh you know it's designed it just started off with a you know ten initial countries that were part of the former Soviet Union\nWhere we wanted wanted to begin with and we want it to begin to connect and build relationships that's the real commodity of state partnership program\nBut over time it has become a program where we have kind of ramped up the training that\nDo we actually generate some readiness in our forces we generate interrupt ability in our forces\nAnd um we have deployed together some eighty times they partner nation has deployed a with a song contingency around the world Afghanistan Iraq were peacekeeping operation somewhere around the world where they have actually deployed as part of a deployment of their National Guard from their state partnership\nIt is a relatively inexpensive program we spend you know about thirty million dollars on events which um there's not many places where you could say thirty million dollars is a small amount of money but in the department of defense realm and those kinds of of dollars are are relatively small uh for the benefits that we get an ... and we create\nFriends and we we strengthen alliances and we build trust between nations and governments in states and we\nIt gives us increased access and should we needed\nPerhaps basing opportunities then it just it it shows us as the United states not to our partner nations than we do all the things that we do in a guard we show about\nUtilization of of the military or for the good of the communities how to use it to to react to disasters and how do you we teach them about search and rescue and how we do domestic operations whether it's\nFloods or or firefighting or or a hurricane or earthquakes I'm we show them some of the capabilities that we have and they share their capabilities and techniques with us\nAnd so we get we get a I think as much a from these partnerships as our\nUm partner nations do at least we hope you know we line them up sometimes with a there's usually some connection between the country uh and and the partner whether it's a large population that happens to live up from like Poland in Illinois for instance or Lithuania and ... a\nWhen you live in Pennsylvania and and so there's a natural connection there that it started off as a very strong partnership and and people have a connection that they can build on and who has been going on for twenty five years ... were an add two new partners this year we're going to add\nA Tanzania and Nepal or will be new partners that we add in the in the next year timeframe and was very very successful program were very very proud of it\nDo you think it makes it easier or more difficult for the national guard as an organization and say uh the active duty army Marine Corps navy air force or to get things like this done does it do you do you notice the sense of cooperation between the individual states in the D O D or the sometimes difficult because you might have people butting heads that they disagree a bit more now I'll tell\nYa you know and and while we as a National Guard are are kind of the ...\nThe state partnership program with our partner correct partner nations what we actually do with them is a very well synchronized in coordinated by one what the country team wants what the ambassador in that country feels a is kind of a ... sort of capabilities we need to develop\nAnd then they work in conjunction with um the combat and command so in Europe these you come and they have a a larger plan that stay partnership is just a piece of but whether it's exercises and like everything that the state partnership does\nWith an in and through other partner nations is all very well coordinated and very well vetted and approved\nBy not only the country team any ambassador herself Ralph also the combatant commander in the army component in the air component it's all very very well synchronized so it's not\nWe're not really going in there and the state and deciding what we want to do a although sometimes the states because of their closeness and their relationship with the people in the country will GET requests which we can then worked through your calm or the combat command and and then we can then execute so it's not a\nIt is not a a you know fifty for everybody for themselves program it's very well synchronized and coordinated and really owned by the combatant commanders or\nOne of your top priorities along with readiness and people at the twenty eighth chief of the national guard bureau is innovation also they recently announced that there's going to be a launch of a space for putting two and two together is there a space guard in the near future general can you tell us anything about that or what role if any of the guard will play in the space for\nWell I'm a you know let me just say this first of all I'm what whatever uh you know the national guard does in the future it will be connected to space in some way that's just the nature of what this domain is doing you know as as as\nMilitary operations have changed\nUm it's kind of like cyber you know you you may think you're not in the cyber world but we always sit there and we use cyber and networks and the like every single day so it's an impossibility that our future force structure in the national guard whatever\nThat looks like whatever services in is not somehow connected and utilizing a the ... the components of space ...\nUm we have currently a in the national guard um you know ... a relatively small amount of space but space across the department is not hugely big in terms of structure so we have\nAbout a thousand people inside the national guard to do everything from you know space control a you work ah as augment teas and launch operations or or\nUm you know as much as considered spaces sitting in a ground based midcourse defense missile silos in the center of Alaska to protect us from incoming a ICBM threats to all of that kind of considered space folks\nUm you know what the ultimate space force looks like where it's located um has not been determined and there's a there's a way to go and what that is but you know I think that our missions that's for sure I Will definitely be connected to the space force and so innovation you know it's part of everything we do as as part of the chief were\nAs part of my priorities is is try to find um you know some new ways to use old things how is it that we can\nAdapt and transform ourselves to be a more ready for some more lethal force be a better contributor to the army into the air force and now we've looked inside our our staff in some of that is in recruiting and how can we train more innovative Leon\nWe've looked at training models that states have options to is you know should we moved to something different than weekend a month and two weeks a year would would for ten day blocks be better kind of training model for us to look at so we're trying to look across the enterprise to say how can we take the most precious commodity our our guardsmen have which is time\nThe access to them to train them to integrate with them and make a more ready lethal force and and so we have a lot of lot of people working on that and it's a it's a lot of time takes up a lot of our our thoughts and what we're doing National Guard were these days\nAs far as where space where it's located seems simple to me we need a base on the moon obviously and that's where the space for some states that we've been speaking with general Josef ... chief of the national guard bureau general you just mentioned recruiting again\nLet me ask you as we finish up here Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen year old comes up to you and says hey why should I joined the national guard what do you tell that\nPerson well I tell them or you know first of all the and part of a the military has been the most satisfying thing in my in my life I mean you're you will do more see more of feel like you've accomplished more given the opportunity to achieve more than any other program out there that that I can think of it it's an enormously\nA satisfying to work in this environment on such a such a competent dedicated motivated to you\nBut there's lots of reasons to do it if you if you're thinking about wanting to get training and some high tech um you know a sector of our community we provide we provide training in cyber we provide training in space we provide training in aviation if you want to be a pilot that it's a good way to do it\nUm you know sometimes many many states have tuition reimbursement for if you want to go to college and you're willing to trade some of your time and serve in the national guard you know you can go to college for free so long as you decide to serve inside a ... you know your National Guard in your state states will pay your tuition\nI'm for you to to go to ah be a member of the national guard and then it is just it is so much\nFun to be a part

the at the service member themselves those who are who are actually deploying overseas\nSure I think we've realized that there's a sense of responsibility that service member has to kind of relinquish responsibility for\nIt reached things like paying the bills for house maintenance for Family Matters\nThe service member just have to relinquish all of that responsibility either to a loved one or a significant other so they can focus on their duty is and what they need to do a while in his deployed environment that there is not going to be a successful mission downrange if folks downrange are worrying about things on the home front\nWhen it comes to the national guard specifically I Want to ask about them particularly as we just recently spoke to General Joe civil and go ... sheep of the national guard bureau does it affect the guard members in the reserve is a different way of those who deploy after not being on active duty\nOh I think so I'm here in Syracuse we're home to the one Seventy forth attack ... which is a New York Army National on air National Guard unit and it's really interesting to see folks who live here in the community of Syracuse they may have been from here originally they have family in the area\nBut when it comes time for that unit to the point they they pick up and they go downrange are leaving behind their families in the city of Syracuse which is a

have three funny little dolls with a picture of my husband and his ... army BDUs or his age to use a in his army uniform standing tall but it's a soft huggable little a pillow type\nDoll that the kids could literally grab on to take to bed with them at night and\nIt was kind of a tangible object of dad that could serve to fill a little void and his absence\nWhat are some of the things that those are those spouses who are staying behind whether serving in the military or not should really keep an eye out for\nI think you first need to set up some\nCushions in and around your own community whether you are in the military community or the community where you grew up then you need to make sure that all of those support mechanisms that you know what's out there and that you don't hesitate at all to utilize them\nA this at that time when if that can go wrong it will um I remember waking up one morning and our car in the garage just literally wouldn't start\nSo it's that time when you need to be able to have a couple friends family members on speed dial\nWho you can reach out to and say I need your help if if I ever need your help before I Need it now and uh this is why\nSo there's

connecting vets dot com on navy veteran Eric day back to our conversation about the effects of deployments on military families with Beth who bought she's the director programs and services at Syracuse university's Institute for veterans and military families [noise]\nHave you talked about some of the programs you're aware of that are available for those families and for those military members during a deployment\nSure let me talk about some of the program's first and then we can switch to protections um\nThe IV and that has a community based program right now it's called American served and what it does it help integrate I'm a number of support organizations that are already existing in your community and it helps veterans service members and their family members\nNet better navigate those resources so say you're a things are tight you need a little extra help financially or maybe your spouse's deployed and that's the time you think you know I I don't have any kids right now I'm going to look at you know getting a job\nUh American served finds a way to bring all of those resources together in a comprehensive way so that you don't have to go out in search of them it pulled them altogether for you\nBut certainly a good thing to be able to have those kind of one stop shop for him to be brought together and when it comes to the protections that are available for families out there whether their financial or otherwise what if some of the things you're aware of that you think are more family should know about [noise]\nSure um there's federal laws that protect family members there the uniformed services employment and re employment Rights Act and in general\nThat was a enacted to help eliminate employment discrimination or because of someone service in the military so it's not uncommon at all that if someone is call to duty to serve you know for a\nPeriod of a year that they might fear that their job might not be available when they come back there's laws and protections that are out there and those are good to know about in advance so that service members can set them up to return and ease back into their life before the deployment of seamless manner\nTom pages ... so yeah and whenever one would be killed in the line of duty you know you just kind of see it pop up and there's a big community outrage and ... you know it's just it's sad it's it's their partner when the dog gets killed\nAnd so in January of twenty sixteen there were eight police canines killed in the line of duty and just got one month there were thirty five within the entire year\nIn twenty sixteen so it definitely it was quite a lot and\nI remember after the fourth one was killed specifically I\nThought what can I Do to bring awareness to what these dogs do and then also find a way to to give back and maybe you know raise money to get medical equipment our protective equipment to these dogs\nAnd it's kind of weird but literally that same moment that I saw the fourth dog that was killed I was reading this dog magazine\nWas off the dock people do and it was just inundated with all these products and I'm thinking you know they're all the same there's nothing different how did these businesses do well and\nI mean the idea it sounds kind of cheesy but the idea really just popped into my head at that moment and I thought\nDog treats let's do it you know let's have some type of tribute to the dogs and and I mean instantly in my mind just went into overdrive\nAnd I'm On I'm texting friends I'm like what do you think about this this this completely Dahmer what and everyone's like no you know that sounds cool thinking I'll just have some other idea and uh just I kind of kept going with it and and really from that moment um it's\nI I've just been all in and so\nUm so what ... is all about is it has a dog treat company\nBut each bag of treats there's a tribute to a fallen ... canine and so it tells a little story it's got a picture of a fallen

Walker was big\nBig do direct time [laughter] I don't know what the processes of of of making the traits that we do have I mean of course my wife has to pick the perfect ones that have the right person um what is the worst auction up the tree it's been like for tonight's food is it something that you just do on your own home is something that you outsource out his artwork\nSo famous sayings so as soon as I had the idea I had the same thought I thought well okay now what how does one make a dog treat and do I just I went into research mode and I mean the the great thing about\nThe time we live and as you can find about anything on Google so that's all right there on\nHow to start a business how to make talk treats and\nI just want to work and so\nThe process is it definitely was a little bit more time consuming not harder but definitely more time consuming and that I thought it would be so once you developed the recipes that you want to use you do have to send them to a certified food lab\nWhere they do the nutritional analysis so it's definitely not as picky as if it was a human food um but they do determine the nutritional analysis\nWith all the ingredients and the minimum things or the guaranteed analysis excuse me do you have to have the percentage of\nThe minimum proteins fat fiber moisture things that most consumers aren't always looking at how many do but it's it's still just a little tiny saying that it's a requirement and then you have to have your treats registered with the department of agriculture and they even have to really approve\nHow your your bag looks and the things that are paid it on your bag so that you can't really have anything that's misleading so one example is\nAlthough all of my ingredients are certified organic and I have to send those certifications to the department of agriculture for every\nSingle ingredient use even though my company isn't certified organic I Can't market on the front of my bag that chain I salute is an organic dog treats\nRight so it's just little things like that that was a learning process but again most consumers once they see the the ingredients\nYou know they see that everything's organic and they're not looking for a while as this particular company organic so it's just been it's been a a learning curve it's been fun though because it's just you know it's it's the talk trade centers what's not fun about a\n...

so\nSo a couple of news stories to get to this morning I I don't know if you heard of but um if you go to coast to coast am dot coms there's there is a really ... is a great piece about the experiments that inspired Frankenstein so as you're heading into\nThe holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way\nThis is a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind ... which is actually a science fiction story not people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction the you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play\nBut it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling science fiction words and that's because\nUm if you really if you think about these like like a robot both the ... version and then the robot that can be for asthma they're all kind of\nPlay on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation and in fact in the\nVery first version of I robot before the ... version of I robot the robot that has created in the very first version of I robot which was in the Nineteen thirties\nSo you sit down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding of like afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at ... am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more\nAbout that about the the tone upon test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but\nBut if they did well then you know they would become the new Roswell I'm kind of happy with the old Roswell very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nThat evening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell I'm and she promotes Roswell as the travel and and you know as a professional opportunity at people move to rouse while all the\nTime but this was that time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask\nYou what your plans were for Halloween what do you do\nIt if if Roger will kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\nAnd most people go out here grade arm which is a local farm and ranch community about seven miles out of town where they practice in the ... is a decreased family I\nCut the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on us first they said that landed in Nineteen forty seven either to get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a Hochberg\nYelling as getting la Salle life you're a crack in Nineteen forty seven other people go out your bottom earthquakes park I had to Mr yet bottom last\nAnd it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to RV camp and things like that but again I'm\nMore more of the stars and the telescope and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory if there is something here that landed and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA new position I'll be teaching you to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roger alright so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip hunter Roswell before we come back up against\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people's tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in being able to\nGo to the crash site\nOr ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the corruption Roswell work what can they do\nBecause they can go to the rival on international year from now and Research Center which is a great opportunity to really dive into their door recall and the research a part of the cry I'm definitely check out the library for those who are really the speakers and do you believe\nIt's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner in deserves it just ... a great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book right it is very little to do with any of the other versions\nOf the hunting appeal how's that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions were these slightly changed the title\nUp but it was just it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but they just did that good so if you're looking for something to be a little bit spooky\nMore in the area of terror than for\nA very suspenseful the hunting appeal how's Netflix um is a is just one of the rare\nThe Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch the news loved and I'll just say that much and I think what even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with with the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that\nThey they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera with a little bit out of brain ...\nSo you know there's there's plenty to you know give you a blues and chills but I mean there were some moments there were\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see\nAnd that's what it was like in the first one I remember them as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I go to handle it if I had seen it so they look for that you can

seventeenth century witch hunt linkage or England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but its\nSalem that sticks out and so why why do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the crap\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery I even that one of the big question I had gotten the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem has what city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of the ... century\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto\nYou know that even you know it's it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there but\n... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you you don't hear about Chicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home of that crazy trivial killer treat the famous world religion\nRight you don't know you don't go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\nRight but I think that's true and I think\nI saw that one is that you know the tragedy but it didn't say on itself\nWas both basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course generations or around say on the actual the actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver's was at the time to film village fulfilling itself doesn't really have a ...\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victims but with trials I mean the actual which is I Lived there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... and sounds kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a\nDetermined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I get to you and this is important and I this is it is great distinction\nCan't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims a murder that they were executed and the projects did their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\nWay dead right at ... at the ad the nuance of the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck out for their believe all the things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's critical of such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know only oh America\n... what's the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it blew up to two hundred and fifty during the the Halloween I'm\nJust a month long series of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they\nThey see that kind of bumps like that or is it just it just it just I mean I really do they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days or two\nOh mathematically I mean some some business is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\n... not really\nYears they've been getting more and more of a ... year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of

for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought she'd you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take were that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week uh tested so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to\nThat everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about like the media would be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy run this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about people who you believe to be guilty of some things\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody to come\nI ask you that\nIn the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train

can we say that but I worked\nOut well I probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say a\nGreat book obviously deserves all the accolades did you did your guinea for

hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or I Would I did um a\nA I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took it in the box and stronger case and probably from various about which may be right or wrong or it out\n[laughter] [noise] well I Love that I mean I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in as well but the managing the train is a story it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\n... is is there any story too old to be told\n... or ... when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe did it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that did either been incorrectly adjudicated\nWhich we know is certainly a cage in the book so far as I read it but also it's true all the time that there will be able to be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case\nA ... a ... a local guy is

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they are ...\n... there's all that are clear geographic pattern and the murders if want occurs just south of Portland them extra curse just north of ...\nOr so that that would be a link between them they uh uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would\nTake a laugh from inside the house turn the wick way down low surgeries gave out a little bit of light\nTake the chairman may offer lap and set it on the floor usually under a table a and then carry the lap around with him as he committed the murder another thing is that he would uh you'll put pull the blankets over the head of a flavor in person or a half a second before you have to I had with an axe\nHow are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blog from a flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nOrdering someone on the er grew quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nUp yeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and go into the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where the murder happened it's not that\nThe town that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new right that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin there was a it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could if I could have followed the\nPoet or another thing I've got a veterinarian we're all in the warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that are very may have weather 'cause first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not a not a plant that probably that occurred in cold weather\nBut he had to please real cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather and probably the warm weather\nAnd um we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for you to be around\n... ... yeah it is probably might be but\nThere's a discussion with my with my ... year which I never would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something like\nA murderer is biased nature done in secret or\nAre they have that in fact that is that is one of the earliest seven nations of the word murder is that going on at sacred there because it has done in secret the facts about it are never fully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um\nYou get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that discussing titled than the this person but uh I'd I'd ... I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just kept document ... all of the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nAnd it's ... it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye to eye with a with a with a vote outlast murders and the series so ah we\nDo is just luck I mean like we'd never in a million years expected to be able to find a convincingly who was actually doing the\n... bought we found a evidence about this man and argue that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of them in\n... and you know you've found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime and excessively after that um as as the years went\nForward it and yet ... ... ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were ... sometimes you were gun involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh by the uh I think that he while he use an ax to make the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was heading the head with an axe\nMy belief is that he had a pistol back in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could product but um there was not what are you trying to do but it's why he would do if you had to do\nIn order to get back to some of the ah the asthma to these crimes coming up next door but before I Do actually pause and say what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you you've you've found demand from the tree\nThey are ... what is the general answer the question is it\nCrime stories are fascinating to us because they ... they come from the parts of our\n... of ourselves that we don't like to talk about ... ... all crime stories are about the last\n... and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but they are they're part of everybody that I've had in the play here ...\n... and and yet we we don't like to talk about do we cover them up a crime stories expose those parts of ourselves\nThat we are ashamed ... the uh [noise] uh\n[noise] ... that's the general after the Y and Z obsessive reader crime but by the way to live with the real prime but with the real world leader or a it's a book by a ... that the wife or a ...

any evidence for two years before he was released or have always believed that he had gotten away with that and he said that reading it in my book back in our book that uh uh it wasn't that we're not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to him\nYeah I was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about had happened\nBut it was it was a shy and said he was a tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a random crime as it is Manhattan actually at that map Manhattan actually gotten away with it but the other problem I I I don't know why it was important to him\nWho while I understand the understanding and says it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with an impoverished I've I've I don't

grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these ... ... that these murders occurred in and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's that sort of equal distance from me and that and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful who made but I Am trying to get people to understand what the what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it\nWas really what the ... ah what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful lie or people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who live in Baltimore the hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and then they got divorced and they started careers and I got promoted and got fired\nThey moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs they they had entertainment so they work to literally every night all of the things that that happened it\nHappened to us happened to them and I was trying to create a a picture\nOf unfortunately it is a picture of their dads 'cause that's a terrible picture because they look die terrible that at all so he's trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader of an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think the change of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the ... can be on things which ... ... ... the ... pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of a town or the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings a fresh contacts\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism conjecture I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there is that there what is it always takes where pay that illustrates the point you were just making and that has to do with the the soccer in the case of taco invent that ends up one\nOf them I think it would suck poll had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty fourth of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a ... they had\nA witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them the ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would rent there would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way the Italian American communities lived a hundred years ago except that it's important than a crime story\n... that's like crime stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nThat I think that brings us very effectively to village gun Iowa ended the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away I'm used to get the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there is a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOr the other night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve or off the lights were out in Alaska due to a a\nA a dispute between the police cars city council and the power company so they had city life and street lights but they were out there and the town was complete darkness\nAs this Sunday night there was a church service or a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims of the woman who was the head of the house\nAfter the ... after the ... I didn't\nGet into this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe in the voice of murders would have would have ever have happened when they did have the lights and on and and the reason that was true\nIs that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about\nA hundred miles away and he normally would not have\nI had another outrage that quickly but because the lights the city was punched in the dark that there was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up anyway ...

that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned there just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding but Joe ... let's let's go down this path\nOf of the process that you use to try to actually\nNarrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper or jeopardy and including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to try to find you know well the sailor went from this poor to that port in in each one of these ports there was a murder so it's it's a good but you have to you always have to START I mean it it's not quite a needle in a haystack but it it just leads maybe um\nYou know to to look at it so\nBroadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing some search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that her name could even be found given the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\nOr a ... year veteran jak river caged I\nAm I read I have read probably twenty bucks I jak\nWith this guy or doctor ever was that guy or jak they are and I and my other book popular prior I've made fun of the people who wrote those books uh the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you could actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are silly\nThe I never really expected that we would find it convincing arguments about who's is who was doing it I mean we were looking gas and Rachel says she didn't expect to find them but I did the um\nUh but when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts in Eighteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw that she knew it was\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime you did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say let's go is is just it's beyond anything that you would\nPreparation for the event live I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see the ... very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA while you have if you had a trip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy enemies that feel that it is his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had a he has to carry to carry the sangre pretty open they are but I ... I don't doubt that there were other violent them to them\nThrough and about his life the uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that a great point what you're headed going into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up\nIn um and then ...\nYear he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get out of ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction\nAnd and you know I'm\nA nurse just a sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths or often rage killers and they just you know they did you pick up things and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that first release came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not an ... or ... because it was not to say it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming right\nAnd well spoken truly makes a good up here and he didn't do any of that he was he was\nA true psychopathic or a psychopath\nHave no fear or perhaps the norm that do not have normal here and one thing that the parent about this man is that on the train is that from his crime as it was not\n... not acting and fear he would he would call in the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been taking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with it or\nI Would probably not that I should have made it this other point for the story\nOf a Paul Miller and math and the training is much larger than our book and we were fortunate enough to find the set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or ...\nAnd going to say well here's what the games that they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they miss the full story about a crime and when that guy Illinois\nAnd the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our ticket or research that so we moved\nOn and printed book but there is still more story to be

Milwaukee and I'm In Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to ... Green Bay or something or in the other guy\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen away or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes near that area after Nineteen away he started just morally more or less trapping in it he he became a Nineteen Nineteen awake at night and Kenny transition to just running loose cross the country\nI bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money at one of the ways you know with him is that why this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room for that and that happens all the time that that that there was a he needed to he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that uh that that guy little was accused of than it was a robbery and and\nAnd yet you know did the same time the let me ask you about the actual so why do you think he would\nLeave the is this the\nMurder weapon at the scene I understand like in the godfather right when you wrap the handle and drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would it would be some evidence just to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWill shoot fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public and making a foreign national bought in his first crimes he just dropped the actor and left his body fingerprints\nAre on the on the act of ... one people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle they act\nIn a bucket of water before leaving a Santa Clara either that book it is every every wherever the second half of his of his career they are\nA ... which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers you knew what was going on and on the uh but here it just a drop the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was fully\nOr if he was he was out of the house\nHe was a unconnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected them to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that but it still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a lawyer that's why I carry my with me right right I mean if there's any occupation where somebody could walk for the next day would be either like\nFirefighter for longer you only two that you're going up on line but they all yeah again mongering oh did he work as a matter but but the thing there are some of the I think he dinner\nAt the accidents that he used the word they lumbering type of actors\n... uh mostly a like a ... there was found in would pile ... almost all of the house I see the murders\nWere a ... ... ... ah we're houses burn would sometimes coal buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the coal\nRight he would he would use the coal acts or the or the ... whatever you found outside the building\n... she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nFingerprint evidence and I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchase the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that to whenever a type of actually had in the house that's the one he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an act no your honor wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah you all\nGoes as why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties and sixties and there were ... at our house and I I dropped a lot of with with him to a burning out\nOn the on my dad deals with similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be shop in the woods and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house of like we we did a lot of wood jumping but for some reason my dad was a judge to try to let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago\nOn the first

caught in ... many many many cereal murders are sort of\nPlaying games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is we have a very unusual\nA aversion to being caught either he wasn't he wasn't yeah absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent and very well thought out you're basically of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene or even the you know\nIf there was a hundred dollars sitting on a shelf there so you wouldn't take it because she knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene fleeing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed for the so no he was he was very these uh quite unusual\nExtent you don't have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint right there I think for a guy

fact gangs of a fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you watch the movie streets of New York right to Scorsese movie that there's a lot of that that was during the day in there that's kinda cool but she loved it because the question about what have you had a modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI I haven't asked to do that because that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know why this is my book is right to say that's what I think and if you think something's ever that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the up a John Douglass monitored while not profiled are has spoken and written about Alaska\nOr one of his observation was that uh\nUh\nHe had several observations about the ... the crimes that are lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murderer had to be older because he is extremely Oregon I\nI mean he's in charge of how organized as this burger this guy is unbelievably organized or the or and and also have the ah you said that\nRubber inland Kelly who was accused of a vertical is a really couldn't have done it a because his mind is very disorganized but also because he was not physically strong in\nA window that Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah\nThere's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked the profile or British opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got my son of the book is about\nInnocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and Nineteen oh to a man named Henry Lambert who was white obviously and this was accused of the crime\nHe was just a a he was a a a knock around me was I got a an uneducated illiterate French Canadian who uh who ah you know cut borderline homeless drank quite a bit it was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years\nUh before a it became a cause all up in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually went to work trying to free him and did free and the governor of Maine eventually a graphic guide to the whole party to him on a on based on ... on actual and us to a\nA buddy that happened after we spent forty years in\nJail there are a lot of stories like that in the in the book it's quite I'm it's a terrible side effects of what happened uh let me get\nThe New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were my Nineteen ten the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated not relative to now but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred this crimes occurred in places didn't have a police or\nThe or the you know they had like a city Marshall and that was it the er so it's not it's not really the the uh not really that connected to my book\nYou know there are no um but it just to the nutrition ... in that movie of\nOf how those gangs operate within the government is seen where everybody was vying for jobs even if that meant getting it's like to keep him and end up by the way I think the profile or would do indoors what\nYou've done I think you know I don't think you'd be very proud of the way in which they might help so it's a nice of you know it really means do I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but\nAnd I'm ... I Believe at one point\nEliot Ness uh when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and look at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly until he white you know till he retired you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly what it is not your car with technically but ... the Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that you're referring to it at\nEliot Ness or after the uh what was hired to try to\nSolve a series of um you know and I had all been named by which the\nCrime period now and they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of a crime that I'm like in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... they were\nThey were act murders they were connected to train the buddy it's twenty\n... uh the\n... twenty five thirty years after the crimes that I wrote about it and I mean it's not like\nYou know I'm not sure about that here's what I I I I Know the case you speaking of ... went to become the public\nWould have to go to the public safety officer public safety commissioner or Cleveland after Chicago um and but those I thought were murders mostly of women again that they were talking about this is being sort of an American ripper\nOn in the world and they were on a liberal then there was one woman was like OK\nRussian Women get very interesting I we have time for John in Long Beach California and then we're going to have to wrap it up or go ahead John\n... thanks I'm not going to go to our way about the size of the gambling but I think\nHey a bill the guy in a in Cleveland out here in LA I'm a longtime journalist out here they think he might have been a suspect in the black guy you're killing of LA enough thought that\nUh and I just real quick about a Lizzie Borden she killed or a she if she did a choose the blade on the act and you said the other guy use the blood and so that would be I guess that'd be something else against the border to ask you real quick did they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if\nYou're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and teletype and stuff like that I mean there there had been some sort of of picture circulated or something of this guy a right to\nThe people knew about a month later if\nYou just blew into and out of town and no one ever no one knew who he was no way of getting idea when you bought bought ... that's a really big boy the first cry\n... everybody knew everybody knew what he looked like it even a very unusual looking man but for some reason that we can't figure out\nNo one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of and then posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west and the same era the ...

Kentucky Bruce you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nAll right I Know you guys are busy let me or run this by you [noise]\nA podcast or by the way I'm\nNineteen Ninety nine Toyota Camry [noise] um got an airbag light that slashing I jump or the wires are the connector underneath the hood the diagnostic connector I got a code Seventy two which means\nDrivers a lab or shoulder about a pre tension or has a short to ground um and I am wondering um if I can\nTake the a trim panel off and go in there and unplug the um\n[noise] um the preach engineer and then re scan it and if I get a code for an open\nWould that mean that the ... and ... or what have you is short and need to be replaced\nWell here's what's gonna happen if you unplug the pre tension or you're going to get a code for shore to\nSee people have the half naked [laughter] I like the way you think yeah but if you unplug the pretense that might be what's wrong with it now the plug it might be broken because if it comes on plug\nThere are two shorting bars in there that that short across the um\nThe wire and some of them have him on the connector some of them are on the um\nThe early ... so what you need to do is you unplug it\nAnd look inside of the connector and see if there's two of you know metal bar the jumps across the two if not it's going to be open and you were would be correct if you unplug your news scan it reads open that would indicate you have either one of bad retention or\nTo the little clips missing when you plug that little plugging him there's little a pause you locked it snaps in the back of it and when that snaps in\nIt spreads apart those shorting bars to allow it to operate\nTo make the connection otherwise it's in a position basically right so if that little thing and we've seen those break on the Toyotas and ... they're famous for a break but if you had ever master list that area of the car and you're wondering why could this just suddenly happen you gotta remember there's a lot of movement and vibration donor on that seatbelt and things can happen but otherwise I Believe you can check the wires to that run\nAlong there I don't think they come from the top they come from the bottom and we have seen also anything that runs along the silk Iraq or the floor paying that's a great opportunity for those wires to have gotten interested with moisture or just overtime\nWet feed you know ... that's ... that's going to be older car Ninety nine it's got a number of years on it you're the good climate down there that helped but I Would check the wiring going to they're also as an opportunity and that's why you're looking at your ideas there\nRight now let me ask you this or how would I go about checking the wire from the um the airbag module to to the part of the driver's side [noise] shoulder\nHarness too I Would it be okay if I unplug the connector at the macho and then go to the end of the connector and do a continuity check\nRight you need to disconnect the battery from the car weighed about Fifteen minutes and then disconnect that airbag ... an disconnect the pretension itself\nAnd then test between the module and the pretense for what you got to be very careful though\nBecause you want to make sure there's a lot of wires on that and you will do all the sensors and all the airbags you want to make sure you're testing the right one because if you and own meter makes a test by sending a small electrical current out one lead and looking forward to come back in the other and looks at the time and things like that and resistance to travel\nIf you connect to know meter to an airbag let's say you're pro but it it was supposed to be this PIN this pin 'cause a lot of words are very similar colors\nAnd they're small if you were to accidentally connect to a different pretentious or\nInstead of the one that you have open there's a possibility you could potentially deploying who could set it off yeah that's that so you want to make absolutely sure you're on the right one and that can be done a couple of different ways of wires were different colors and you have a wandering diagram off the Internet that says let's say PIN Nineteen and twenty were the ones\nI don't know what they are and this one but if those were the two and a wire is yellow and green and they match up for those pins when you go to the other into the connector and you see the same in a same\nCaloric advice you with this guy and this might be the worst advice I've given today advice would give the day\nBut I was first just take that thing apart over by the pretentious or physically look at inspect do I see anything you might have some that will jump right out at you and if you don't see anything in the ... before you start doing a bunch of

whatsoever\nEight six six five nine for Ford won five oh let's talk to Iran and North Dakota ray you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nAnd my question is enough out of their call what I Would like to have access to a website where you can check the echoes out before you purchase um the frozen car is is that just say\nWell there's actually quite a few of them up you know one of the more trusted in one over the years was Consumer Reports they have got you know they they\nI get suspicious anymore and everything but they claim to be fairly independent ... and you always got to look to see who's funding what and and what angle they might lead but they have proven over the years to be quite independent on their tests and they've also archived a lot of their tests that they've done over the years\nThat you can go back to uh they test about everything car and driver motor trend rodent track\nThey are they like the more the specialty vehicles first but at some point they do get into a test of of common cars I and I said kind of just the more normal stuff\nAnd those you have to be a little aware of because they might score something higher or lower based on something that they think it's important that has no but ... exactly and they will do long term\nTests where they put the cars into their fleet and they drive him up Consumer Reports there's a similar thing there are but as far as a Web site are you thinking where you'd look and see okay this cars that this many problems reported um that sort of a thing I guess we'll make sure what they're looking for\nYeah that is correct\nSo it'd be kind of a forum were boy that that I got to think about that for a second I think a lot of uh\nIt's just kind of education so yours it's running bad now but I Would bet at at some point\nProbably going to run bad all the time or the temperatures are going to change so now it it does it at fifty or sixty you know and then all the time and it could be until you get get my first step and diagnosed in years would be to plug it into a scan tool and I read the fuel terms when the engines warm\nAnd then I'd let it sit there and as it cools off watching them and if they keep climbing up as it gets cooler and then finally it starts running rough and their way off that's going to explain to her piece of fuel tremendously well a field for him just the the engine computers says\nWere designed with this much fuel going in and this much air going in to run smoothly and with gasoline that's fourteen point seven the one they called us you'll metric ratio is a big fan and I were just means\nAt ... at that rate I'll be right even\nThe fuel will burn it's cleanest with this most power and most completely you too much fuel its rich gets too much fuel and it's it's all the help like to lean a that's also bad you get excessive heat and that can damage thing so you want that perfect ratio while the engine computer at the perfect ratio\nMeasured by the oxygen sensors will say zero you know we're we\nMight we're ... we're both between ... originally originally originally ... were right\nThere were zero well if you start applying um\nYou start doing things like adding ethanol to fuel you go five ten Fifteen twenty thirty percent even going up while the fuel the computer can adjust for that it's completely electronic though it says let's add more fuel were still perfectly safe no check engine like\nIf you have a vacuum leak this very small as it gets bigger it'll keep adding fuel until it can't any longer when it\nGot to know the thing that can add via the computer\nOr take away the up and if it like a leaky fuel and check your well if they can't do that anymore it turns light on gives you a warning but there are situations like this truck that at times\nIt can control that fuel and keep it in that range and keep the light off but when it gets cooler if it does develop a leak and that's just one of the things that could do it it could be as simple as a dirty masterful censor too but when that changes that's when the light comes on\nAnd if you had a vehicle doing this and it did not have a light on and it seemed like everything was\nFine it can either be that you've got a carbon build up in the valve area and that carbon when it gets cool can really mess up their fuels and pray in the field trim into the vehicle uh so you've got a you've got things that can come with age too that will affect this and I think we're Ross the\nPoint you make for our listeners know we want to blame things on something but sometimes the ... the result is just a an an erosion over time as I understand it for you and book super cheap\nClarence thanks very much for the call that'll do it for another hour of the end of the show until next time

any more\nInteresting does it just until it's more possible that we've got a vacuum leak we go down that would actually wrote quite a bit but it's pretty common yeah and they're different in different vehicles different sources\nWhen something warms up what an engine warms up a lot of people have annoying like do here I have a knock knock into it warms up ... do we determined a lot of that exhaust manifold looking at as they warm up\nThe expand seal up they're quiet same thing happened with an intake desk spans seal up the answer doesn't surge other things on engines that can cause them to run

service center and the text they're hooked up to it they'd be watching this vehicle to see what it's doing on\nThe on the scanner with the rich lean codes and different things to see how it's running and they'd be able to pinpoint the swat easier but without looking any tools to it you just want to do a physical inspection first make sure everything is hooked up properly in the air intake system make sure these clean you might even consider fuel injection cleaning and see if that helps the problem\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's another call the came into the hotline\nDoug can have a\nFour Camry that has stopped problems accelerate\nStalling problem is when you accelerate that seems\nA bad yeah I'm a lot of cars will develop certain things that are inherent who them so when we see one that does is the one that does that mean we know the model like that\nIt leads us directions stalling one taking off in this model car there's been some issues with 'em as they age a little bit we if they're over sixty thousand miles we've seen some ... so when you celebrate you get a flashing check engine like you get a you know a starter\nAs you accelerate and that is one of the things that can happen those quote pack so we went from spark plug wires years ago to these in a separate oil to one ... per cylinder so that they can\nSupply more power to spark plug for clean burn as you can just stay recharge faster because one will spark and then the as the other four are the three go than that one has time to fully recharge we're talking about the whole\nLot easier for six people to do a tug of war than one\n... exactly and with the old one you had one coiled trying to hit every cylinders that went around so it would it would not go with that is something to check first they need to check the state of to you need to have a mechanical that and see what the state of tuna that engineers do we have failed and coiled or do we have worn a spark plugs\nAnd then you get into more more technical things or whether or not when you smash them the throttle is it is\nIt reading that correctly is there a problem with the throttle positioning censor I mean those are things that are going to be a little more finite in their diagnosis but all those things really if if you're not getting a check in July you kind of got to fall back to that based system\nBased fuel based electrical or what are you don't start putting a light on it something in that delivery system of either fuel or electrical and that's what you get into some other stuff uh that rather than talking about\nEight six six five\nNine for for one five what caught your attention and the automotive\nWorld well Toyota's is issued a recall is better if you've got a an Eighteen or Nineteen tundra which is pretty new and yeah at this release\nWe've been having some airbag things going on and\nWhat's happening is is the car when you start to the truck when you start 'em up it's not reading all the sensors correctly and causing this thing to be in a fault mode so you're airbags may not deploy and a collision\nSo few purchased an Eighteen Nineteen tundra and you don't know about it yet I don't know about this recall get ...\nGet the facts contact your your deal your local dealer give them your vehicle identification number if you bought it from them they're going to have your name and the number on filed is telling her name there'll be a look it up for you\nAnd see if it's got in the open recalls on when cars coming our shop it tells us when there's an open recall and the majority of cars and we print it out and handed the customers they look this means it's free it's a recall safety related\nTake this and get this performers and they'll tell us parts available or were aware of the recall no parks available\nA little bit rusty scout and I'm like oh this is kinda cool what year was it I Want to see what's the Seventy\nFour or five I'm going to go look it up and then you read the orange knows white\nIt was a hard top was it was I Believe will not have three or four of eating it or something like that I think to me yeah and it was definitely an eight and ... for whatever reason into old drive that thing could spend the tires\nMy ... one of my best friends and my cousin Todd he snapped a drive shafted it finally we we got a little too aggressive with it but that made a a number of runs up the split rock river\nWhen it was frozen in the wintertime [laughter] up into the trees I could talk about it now but [laughter] it was up I was the wrong person to pick up on my life right [laughter]\nIt was free right so I bought a raffle ticket right or what it was you know their bottom of the split Renault don't we used we used to\nBe sold to somebody who was still serviceable well thanks for calling me appreciate it Don Don thanks very much for the call good luck let's talk to Nathan Nathan you're on the under the hood show what can we do for ya\nHigh I I've got a two thousand five Subaru Legacy wagon and we've got problems with the rear suspension the bed the back of the car sex it almost looks like it's been lowered and we can't seem to figure it out on what needs to be replaced or what's going on um\nAll the the whole batch shock springs all that had been replaced in a funny thing I think it's gotten a little worse some kind of looking for ideas I mean I've even found on line where a couple of different places ourselves actually selling saying he bought space there's for super so I don't know if this was a common problem that that's the solution or not\nWe're all those springs instructs replaced with brand new parts\nYes yeah and I and it ... years I actually replace the whole just by order the whole um shock and spring altogether because I didn't want to mess with a compressed into springs down and when you and I didn't even I Know it\nWas it good as soon as you did that for a short period or is it still exactly the same\nRemember it being a little better but it never really fixed the issue okay is it\nThe same problem with the grand prix using that Ninety seven to ...\nLeave for a full ready to throw it on there with everything on it correct\nYep exactly yup just held it right on\nSome of them were just lower like with the grand prix in that car they just\nThey set a little lower when they were brand new they were good for ten thousand miles of them they settled and that's where they stayed and they were lower and if you don't like the way they that they do have some time space available when you put those pages in it sometimes you need a lime and sometimes you don't depending on\nWhat is a modified in that suspension on a car but they they do ride the all the ones I could picture in my head right now that our customers have most of them ride pretty low\nAnd I pulled it up on Google Images all the images looked like the Atkins ride ... like they all look like they're saying look at it to a little bit yeah I guess\nI'm not I'm trying to understand if he's describing something where he is or if he had some of those uh you know those things people hanging there were bumper if they'd be dragging on the ground it or if you know how low it is in your nicknamed the Kurdish part well there but then there's\nA hitch on that there's a hitch on there and it drags out it drags you know\nEasy if you had had ... and all the weight from many just [laughter]\nYeah there isn't a bunch of weight and back or anything but it just looks like it's sitting lower than it should like something's wrong with a ...\nWell I'm just trying to think of the way the cars you know the Palestine the car if there's anything that could be on the front the they become just trying to think through the geometry of the car if there's anything we're missing here\nOr anti sway bars are are going to stop typically left and right when you're keeping the car flat when you're going to a quarter of that really shouldn't have anything to do with it\nUm you know as far as the suspension in the back you know some of the cars not this one day to have like a ... a transfer Springer across there that would sometimes crack and what people would like in the grand prix the earlier ones that was a common problem but\nNot in this kind of a car it's it's kind of an independent suspension with that ... there's only so many single that there is there's only so many things back there I Would say that if you don't hear any\nIs there any downside to putting those Pacers enemies or anything that's going to ... that\nNo water or it could harm something you want to give it aligned you and you want to good qualities pleased with the break on you and then you want to give it a line because when you changed the height of a car the right how you're going to change the alignment on it so it's gotta be gotta be aligned after that's been adjusted\nThe even the like Chevy Truck a lot of people will put the the crooked and the dodge do they want to ... have leveling kits available for them to to bring you end up you want to make sure those things wind good\nYeah we did that on my sons pick up we put the level or a kid on the front spring blocks in the back just to bring the right how are you up a little bit and we brought it down headed arranged headed aligned after that just to get back into true and that was the recommended operating procedure\nNathan thanks very much for the call good luck that'll do it for another hour of the under the who'd show until next time you can find a timeline that under the hood

Doug gum to learn how they can help you create your dream bathroom\n[noise] and where we go we are going to do well in Livermore, California who's calling\n[noise] hey my name is Samantha and I have a question about how to make my that there are more pet friendly got some types that need to be washed\nOh okay I think we can help me make a bathroom more pet friendly\nUm you know um [noise]\nI got to tell you that pets\nAre a lot like children they are so many kids you know there are three kids\nAnd a lot of that we do Sam\n... uh to protect our pets\nIs the same thing that the same things that we do to protect our our toddlers are little children sometimes are bigger children\nThat both ended the age spectrum\nAn open concept shower if you're up for a little bathroom remodeling here's an idea that can both turn your bounds room into a more luxurious space and give you a better resource for bathing your pet\nA an open concept shower I think about this\n... eliminate any sort of ... ... means you don't have to climb over the wall to take your regular showers you don't have to lift your up an over the wall to get it they\nAre so open concept shower is limited eating that\nA ... oh right okay and then of course a curb list open concept shower is even more appealing because it's but you know I have to tell you\n[noise] um [noise] my love\nWith pepper for I've screwed me with a rosy for fourteen years was to bring her into the shower right standard on the bench on a towel so she wouldn't slip right and scrub are down two or three times scrub Brent scrub brands and she loved it\n[laughter] hey Sam if you've ever seen the videos of dog that didn't want to take a shower [laughter]\nThat those are so funny and that open concept curb list shallower but certainly be the way to sort of slide them in there\nNo matter what it looks sized dog are we talking about\nUm oh sized dogs all sides\nSamantha how big is your dog\nOh Rosie was a ... well you know Sam Sam I'm Sorry yeah I\nKnow how big is your mom and my thought is a hundred and thirty pounds big can shower would be very [laughter] sounds like he weighs more than you do [laughter]\nI thought how about non slipped shower floors you know uh I I just\nMentioned a moment ago that when I was showering Rosie\n... uh that I put down a towel on the tile bench and a wet towels sticks to the tile\nAnd gives a and gave rosy a footing so that she wouldn't slip yeah well she only weighed eight\nPounds yeah but the bottom line is that\nIf you have a a a a child shower fan or a dog or doesn't have the grip that we have their paws were a little bit more from than ours\nSaturate remember they're standing on their fingers\nYes and so the bottom line is that a ... a ... good surface is really really important in a and if\nIf you have the slippery shower ... or you might think of adding something to the shower that will make it more than ... good and there are elements that you can add that will glue on very easily and allow that to happen then of course\nA hand shower hand shower makes washing your pet so much\nEasier [laughter] um I mean\nThe the thing that made that that rosy loved\nWas that nice warm water just the temperature few like within two or three inches from for hair you know and warming up and getting ready for their shampoo and then warming a warm rents are the shampoo and then again and again and she really loved that through a a\nHand shower is a\nAn absolute must and then of course a\nBathroom tile bathroom floors um uh you really want to make sure that uh they're the floors are waterproof\nAnd that their pet friendly and not so slippery that your pet will have trouble maneuvering if they're you know walking around wet in the bathroom\nYou know what's really interesting as self closing twin ... so the dogs don't drink at a twin\nUh yeah you know that's a specially bad if you have chemical cleaner yet uh than what you have is poisoned water\nThat's right and uh having the live close is really important that doesn't sound it sounds silly but locked cabinet just like you lock for toddlers\nIs also important I've seen cats and dogs open doors with handles oh yeah yeah so there's anything that smells good and I think it tastes good oh yeah you know and there are so many poison in the bathroom cabinet anyway that's all we have to say about that thanks for your call Sam\nAnd I think to think about\nA nice weekend salmon captain Dan [noise] I think it's about trying to break and listen to a little bit of Halloween [noise]\nYep you know the song about magic to

I Do that by the end the front\nPorch uh-huh and I blow the leaves out onto the driveway then I sweep everything up put it in the dust pan put it in the garbage and you blow it ...\nI Do I gosh darn you're you're you're right and you're not allowed I didn't know what you were doing out there as a matter of fact that's really cool because yeah thank you for reminding me because I just did that the day before yesterday I did the grudge looks terrific yeah it does and one of the things\nThat we have to contend with in our garage is our spider webs because we don't uh occupy that space therefore all the little guys that make a webs uh happened to be very happy and content out there and and safe\nBut you have to end up you end up walking through spider webs and of course dust builds up on all your property that you're storing out there so it's a good idea to blow everything down and I use I have a little tiny Ninety nine dollar\n... I'm a Milwaukee a hand blower it's very lightweight\nVery powerful and it does the trick for me and of course the battery costs more than the blower but the bottom line is that I keep it in the\nGarage all the time uh by the way you can blow if you've got a good a leaf blower you can blow a\nSlight snow off the off the sidewalk before it turns to ice\nYou can clean your gutters with a blower or you can sweep driveways and sidewalks which saves on wasted water I Know a lot of people like to hosed down their driveway and sidewalk with water we used to do that when I was a kid water is a little bit more pressure snow and more expensive and more expensive yeah\nAnd of course a there is uh some some blowers mine doesn't but there are some blowers that have a vacuum and will actually mulch uh we just discussed that a little\nUh is before the last brick so you know a blower is a really good tool to have around especially if you realize all the different\nUh processes but you blow down patio furniture yeah uh it's just wonderful yeah and that's all I have to say about that Andy tool handy tools\nAnd uh I Want to say a\nDream I Hope you're having a good time in Costa

right and for the first twenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show the vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on my item in the were from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise them and they're developing skin\nCancer but that I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went oh my God it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength can you do three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor us it's kind of a quandary thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nRolling from side to side you wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of there's vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain fibromyalgia\nI Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while here of course strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like family in a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of result to be seen\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamin D three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a

'bout folks me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns but you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that\nThere are a couple of different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formula to different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your

Luther nailed those Ninety five pieces to the door of the capital church in whittenberg Germany those\nTheses would it be topics of debates Luther critique of a church which he felt had gone seriously astray from its task of proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ to those who are in need of\nHearing that good news hearing that sweet sweet news\nLooser as he was growing up as he lived his early life he was certainly a product of his time there was this overwhelming concern with sinfulness and especially with the judgment of God he would confess to sing at great length only to return a short time later to confess anything that he might have\nForgotten that he remembered on the way from the confessional booth\nIn some ways the church of the day was structured to be this sin management system the chief concern was not the eternal life side of the equation there was a sense that that people would get to heaven\nEventually the problem was more a matter of what about the temporal what about the this worldly punishment because of sin\nIf not enough was done to satisfy that punishment than there would be time in purgatory which was sort of this limbo between heaven and hell where you would spend sufficient time to take care of the worldly punishment which did not get taken care of in this life\nAnd those punishments do could be taken care of by doing good works by\nSaying prayers by visiting relics those holy items such as bones of dead saints or maybe if somebody had a piece of the true cross or any such fully hide them you would get\nYears off of your stay in purgatory by going and veteran racing these things and you can also pay money\nYou could pay money and receive an indulgence and that was the problem that especially brought about the reformation Luther was seeing his people spend their money to buy these indulgences that would then spend the money on down to Rome\nAnd not really give the people anything that they needed was losers fought the gospel was enough\nAssurance of not only salvation but also of the complete forgiveness and that's why I think we read ... John eight enrollment three every year for reformation Sunday there is this sense of knowing the truth\nAs understood by Martin Luther which does give freedom\nAnd the truth is it's not the works with the law it's not the law that saves us we're no longer under that system where sin was managed for a profit because forgiveness is forgiveness and we confess\nWe make that confession of sin each week knowing that we are forgiven\nJesus one that for us on the crime and then we strive into strive to live into that new life for forgiveness the life of the forgiving on the life of a forgiven child of God\nToday is reformation Sunday the readings for those lessons those are what we read this morning there on the bulletin has always but it's also the twenty third Sunday after Pensacola and those are the reading that we would have read this morning except for those reformation festival reading\n\nThe regular reading from the ... from those appointed readings for each week the one that lands on today is mark chapter ten versus forty six to fifty two [noise]\nAnd that follows right after what we heard last week where Jesus was again making the point about those who are greatest or wanting to be greatest\nAre the ones who will be the servants and so\nThe reading from mark chapter ten yet is\nThe story of blind bar to mass in chapter eight before Jesus asked the question who do people say that I Am he healed a blind man\nAnd then there are those three times where I talk about what it means to be messiah what that mission of the ... looks like and how it is titled are just not understanding then we have this story of barter males than other blind man chapter tad beginning adverse forty six and then they reach Jericho\nAnd as Jesus in his disciples left town a large crowd followed them a blind beggar name barter may have signed up to me it was sitting beside the road\nWhen bart may have heard that Jesus of nuns was nearby he began to show she is the son of David have mercy on may\nBe why it\nMany of the people yelled at him\nBut he only shot at all the loudest Sunday but have mercy on me\nWhen Jesus heard him he stopped and said\nTell him to come here\nSo they called a blind man cheer up they said come on and he's calling you bought a mask threw aside his coat jumped up\nAnd came to Jesus what do you want me to do for you Jesus at\nMy rabbi\nThe blind man said I Want to see and Jesus said to him go\nFor your faith and ... and instantly the man could see if you follow Jesus down the road\nIt strikes me that this was also a good reading for reformation Sunday\nBarter man says by the side of the road as Jesus is passing by we have no idea what he knows we\nHave no idea what he has heard\nMark doesn't give us those details\nIt was back in chapter nine\nThe healing of the boy possessed by the demon who thrown into the fire thrown into the water\nThat was the last time that Jesus has killed someone in the gospel of mark and that was way up in the north and now here we are down by Jerusalem between Jericho in Jerusalem\n\nSo we don't know what this guy might have heard you know the next door to mark tells us is in fact when Jesus make fat entry into Jerusalem the beginning of holy week we don't know what he knows we don't know whether you heard\nBut we do know he knows enough to call out\nNaming Jesus the son of David\nAnd you just heard is it a cry of faith\nYou think\nIt was crying out by ... I mean that's the cry of reformation after all\nThe man who was blind cries out and desperation a familiar cry which I suspect we've all made\nAt one point or another it's cry which cries out because there was nothing else to be done\nThe ban cry\nAnd then the crowd gets in on the act instead of offering words of encouragement setting giving giving words of guidance and whole\nThey just tell him to be quiet\nThey do not want this one this blind bar to\nMe as an outsider to be bothering Jesus interesting isn't it\nThose who are following after Jesus in the crowd seemed to be doing a better job of following the disciples\nInstead of following Jesus\n'cause the blind man is being treated as the children were no no no keep the kids away from you start to important for children\nNot important enough to bother Jesus keep them on the outside\nDon't let him don't let them near\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nUh\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nRight right\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd\nUh I don't\nKnow I\nUh\nBye to the stand as we see bill\nBut [noise]\nI'm a woman\nLast time a you know I'm ...\nTo have you know I Know na\nNa na na na na na na na na na na\nNa na na na I'm well I'm In a long long long long way\nAway for\n\nDa da na I'm\nIf I had done a\nFew maybe an hour and a one man show\nHow Iran and all kinds of\nGod the creator of the universe we offer to use the skip the glory there were a kingdom in the name of God father son in ...

talk about your book you profile leaders and they're not all from the same page will Disney Robert he leaves Martin Luther king junior or all subjects in this book are so different though what do you think they have in common\nWhile I think they all at some point we're viewed as leaders meeting they got people to do things or they cause things to happen in some cases they founded companies in some cases they were political leaders and other cases religious reformation in every case they were able to bring people to move in a direction\nAnd often using very different qualities and skills\nIs that how you define a leader being able to motivate people\nI think that is actually too simplistic I think a leader actually is some\nPerson that emerges from interaction between the leader and followers and then the unique context of the situation\nAnd from that you get this leadership that comes out almost like a chemical reaction the leader is part of that equation part of that process but I don't think the leaders necessarily the dominant part of it over we tend to want to think of it that way\nDo you think most of the folks that you profile in your book set out to be leaders or is it part of a chemical reaction to that question that you talked about\nI think it's part of the chemical reaction if we take out Albert Einstein for instance he was a brilliant physicist he became a leader partially because of his credibility in science partially because he had a very interactive nature with people he will thirty thousand letters in his lifetime\nHe brought along young physicist he created in people a sense of community and he entered a community of science that that was nurturing for that but he added to it and he looked like our uncle he looked like everybody's uncle and so we made something very difficult approachable and show\nIn all of those ways he brought us towards science she let us in some directions not only for science but also for social causes\nWhat stood out to you in terms of the Achilles' heels for some of these leaders were brought about their downfall\nYeah in many cases like Margaret Thatcher the prime minister of Britain\nYou have a certain natural arc she became very effective as a politician because she was very convinced of the righteousness of her policies she pushed it that was part of her selling point it was what made her attractive over a number of years in office however that start to warrior fan and she\nDeveloped a very centralized leadership style almost autocratic\nAnd people are tired of that over time so sometimes I think a leader tries to amass power and influence and when they do that can begin to work against them because people naturally start to reject it\nAnd Robert ... of course\nWell Robert he leads a fascinating case as an incredibly talented soldier also a gentleman if you and I met him you'd be struck by his quarterly manners and his charisma but in reality he made a decision at a key point is life\nTo betray the country that he had spent thirty two years in uniform for and to do it in defense of slavery now we can talk about it he was being loyal to his state or to the south but in reality it was what we would call a turkey in moment\nWhere he had the chance to get something right and you got to completely wrong and\nSo when we look at them as a leader we've got to look at it with both sides of that there's a conflict the story part of Robert de ... roared narrowly admirable and I still mired that part of him but I think all of us also need to be realistic that many of our leaders have
