where we got plenty of stories this week and one of the stories has to do with probiotics you know last week a story came across\nThe media or which then here's a sample headline probiotics are mostly useless and can actually hurt you\nTalking about a click made headline of this is a story that is highly inaccurately reported the steady based on a mere Fifteen volunteers\nResearchers at the Weitzman Institute in Israel gave probiotics to the volunteers and lo and behold they discovered that only in some of them did the probiotics actually\nAppear in their stool samples\nAnd as a result of that they claim that provide acts are useless\nAnd this is something that we've long noted is that when you do is to test on somebody taking certain probiotics sometimes the robotics don't appear in the tools to judge thing that they don't take root they don't colonized a\nHowever the researchers themselves readily admits relying on fecal samples as an indicator what goes on in the gut\nIs inaccurate Enron and I'm quoting the researchers themselves never lost a journalist saw fit to publish the headline probiotics are mostly used was based on this study\nAnd here's this study that came out just a couple of days ago actually just yesterday out of Georgetown University medical center headline probiotic use may reduce antibiotic prescriptions and here's what the researchers found\nYou're listening to an encore broadcast the best of intelligence to me Dr Ronald\nSubscribe to the intelligence medicine podcast updated several times we can go to the are half dot com [noise]\nWelcome back to television medicine that will happen here and you can call us eight seven seven seven to six eight to five five yeah you can really call it's actually a wait a little bit of a glitch in the beginning of the show because there was a fire alarm the studio\nAnd are are a intrepid or engineering staff had do momentarily evacuated until they determined that it was a false alarm and they came back but probably some Colts came through at the beginning of the show so you can start dialing again age seven seven Seventy six eight to five five we are indeed\nLive and we're taking your questions related to medicine the nutrition\nRight you heard of or the anti inflammatory diet this is really an important concept in nutrition is that certain foods are inflammatory and certain foods are anti inflammatory\nOr anti inflammatory food consists of a fresh fruits and vegetables or even tea and coffee have potent\nAnti inflammatory properties due to their Pauli female content I'm\nLow fat she's actually hold fat she says low fat she's here but I don't see any reason to exclude a normal fat she is\nA olive oil canola oil nuts chocolate and moderate amounts of red wine and beer these are all anti inflammatory if it's something that sounds familiar a has a lot to do with the Mediterranean diet that is a\nPrimer for anti inflammatory foods are including a poly female rich olive oil\nAnd what's pro inflammatory then we'll prove laboratory foods include a a process red meat refined carbohydrates a ship's a soft drink beverages sugary desserts\nA and so on these are all pro inflammatory particularly a cold beverage is very very pro inflammatory so\nThey did a study\nOf the effects of\nVarious anti inflammatory pro inflammatory diets on the risk of dying\nIsn't that what it's all about yeah we can see you know the risk of heart disease the risk of a cerebral vascular disease the risk of cancer but really what it's all about is avoidance of dying\nRight when it comes down to it generally Journal of internal medicine study sixty eight thousand Swedish men and women aged forty five eighty three you get to a pretty good records they're good record keeping and the Nordic countries they were followed for sixteen years\nParticipants who most closely followed ... diet had yet there's an Eighteen percent lower risk of all cause mortality\nThere was a twenty percent lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and they Thirteen percent lower risk of cancer mortality when compared with those who follow the diet to a lesser degree of smokers who followed the diets\nThis it's interesting smokers who followed the died experience even greater benefits when compared with smokers who did not follow the time so it suggests that a an inflammatory diet can even for protection on smokers and such and say that smoking is okay but you can mitigate\nThe effects of smoking with an anti inflammatory diet in a companion study this one is from a University of Illinois\nDietary fiber reduces brain inflammation during aging and\nRain inflammation is now thought to be a major cause of all timers disease and other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease or these conditions afflict many older Americans\nAnd uh if you don't get outright old timers disease you're probably gonna lose some IQ points on the way to being Ninety five\nAccording to a new study from the University of Illinois there may be a remedy to delay the inevitable dietary fiber\nNow what's the benefit of dietary fiber when it comes to brain inflammation\nWell when you consume dietary fiber the bacteria did just the fiber and they produce what are called short chain ... fatty acids in particular something called ...\nAnd ... they say is of interest because it's been shown to have an inflammatory properties on the ... which are the little cells in the brain that are responsible for clean up\nAnd be arrayed improve memory in mice when administered as eight separate supplements one of the problems with sodium Buner age you can give it to people but he has a really stinky smell it poorly tolerate and\nI've used it but it's hard to get people to take sodium beer it actually a better way to get ... into your brain to eat fibers so the bacteria in your intestine can transform\nThe fiber it to shore chain ... fatty acids including ... this new study reveals that old might be arrayed inhibits production of damaging chemicals by inflamed micro ugly\nSo ah\nThe research say people are not likely consume sodium berate directly due to its noxious odor\nA it's sort of smells like goats hind quarters [laughter]\n... said it's really smelly in fact\nUh you've heard a stink bombs you know sometimes they try to create a a some sort of disturbance a campuses by throwing stink bombs I Know that happened during the Vietnam War on my campus and are they true a computer age stink bomb\nInto one of our classroom buildings and for weeks and weeks afterwards the building stink\nSo how do you get that stuff to be made inside of you will less likely that you're going to take\nOral sodium ... more likely that simply by taking fiber in your diet\nOr you're going to prove your shirt chain ... fatty outs of production which has a direct beneficial effect on your brain reducing inflammation and every habit that any inflammatory diet and fiber are these are things that can help ward off\nInflammation which is one of our past ways to disease heart disease cancer an early death\nOr what we're talking about the gastrointestinal tract the ears of very very

I don't know if they are\nUh the claims that they are uh from safe sources uh I'm not sure that that's entirely true because if you take a\nYou know you may get some bad stuff in there you may get some some led to mercury some cadmium in there\nA so unless the company has done specific testing for the presence of harmful minerals\nUm maybe that's not so good and besides the the potency of these things is very low so in a multiple you might get I don't know thirty fifty milligrams of zinc\nA in a colloidal formula you may get do one or two milligrams of snake so you're not getting very much you're not getting a lot of bang for your book when you get these global products I mean there are but I think they're marketed as kind of a\nA a hype the alternative to ordinary supplements\nBut I think that the claims are really overblown and I'm not a big fan of coal Lloyd all minerals never have been so thanks for that a good question um [noise]\nAre you a muscle head or you can find your activities to just brisk walking that the sum total of your assertions well here's this study big study\nI'm eighty thousand\nAdults over thirty and they followed them for a long time from Nineteen Ninety four and two thousand eight and during that time there were a fifty seven hundred deaths\nAnd so this kind of a way to see well what's going on relationship between exercise and the risk of dying among these are adults and they looked at\nStrengths promoting exercise resistance exercise versus aerobics exercise or a combination of both and the impact on various diseases or on overall death rate so what they found is that it hearing suggest strength training\nWas associated with a Twenty one percent reduction in the risk of dying\nOr eight thirty\nFour percent reduction in the risk of cancer\nOr and that's pretty good at hearing to just\nAerobics little less suffocation is sixty percent risk of dying a cardiovascular disease reduction of twenty two percent\nBut if you're here to both guidelines or there was a twenty nine percent risk of dying overall there was it thirty percent reduction in cancer\nAnd\nResults of the studies suggest that promoting adherence to the strength exercises guidelines over and above\nGeneric physical activity targets would result in better health outcomes in other words if you're going to exercise yeah sure you know do you know with the usual direct within a hundred and fifty minutes of aerobics to exercise a ... you know take a brisk walk forty minutes at least three times a week\nCovering you know at least a couple of miles that's all

have seven seven\nSeven to six talk is our number and let's hear now from Ryan in Queens Hi Ryan yes\nHi Hi docked often I have a quick question I um I've suffered from guest writers periodically here um for the last couple of years\nGot out of it recently stomach nausea and I also have chest congestion went to my primary care physician about a month ago and he looked out all I see you know you and your your all your old congested and planes go getting used to next ... or or um or the other one now anyway those and just keep taking them every day\nAnd it should get better I haven't noticed a big difference it's yeah you always feel like when you want to clear your throat you still have jak congested and yet I guess that's allergies and so forth\nSo uh and then they know what he had started to get a little bit more severe I thought well let me go to my guest rather odd to see ...\n... he said well it's been five years since we've done we've done and asked me for you do not have a good idea to get it off to begin yes exactly did end up going to be on Tuesday and he didn't seem to think of anything at this age they did say guest right as but nothing so crazy or anything [noise]\nI guess I'm just calling you talk to obviously have kind of foods I should avoid or I didn't take him by the way for Hanukkah\nAnd you sit next and vitamins every day or anything you can recommend to take to avoid this condition it's kind\nCutter yeah you know what's interesting is I it just illustrates something called the L. P. R. or ... or reflux and we recently had a doctor Jamie ... on our program you can find the pod cast into your Hofmann dot com she wrote a book called dropping out that about ... she's an ear nose and throat doctor believes that\nAre current way of treating it which is to prescribe powerful out to bloggers like pro tonics is wrong headed guy actually leads to a perpetuation of the problem I mean surely if you have an ulcer or severe gassed right as a you may need to take one of those medications short term but taking the long term\nA sense of kind of a vicious cycle [noise]\nUm [noise] so\nYou're in treating L. P. R. you know we have to deal with\nUh the allergy aspect of it which affects the mucus membranes in the nose in the back of this road we also have to deal with the city\nBut not using powerful labs have blockers using a soothing agents like D G L which is a licorice extract a also you can take a aloe Vera Jews to bedtime my favorite a brand of it is literally the desert because very few are without preservatives\nUm you take a quarter cup at bedtime and perhaps at a nutritional quarter cup on a rising and maybe in mid day for not eating foods around that\nAre also this radical end if in which is helpful for uh the esophagus and the stomach or independence available via full scriptures are online dispenser ... take it as directed it's a powder that dissolves in the water it's very helpful for many more patience with a\nA bird and reflux an L. P. R. but it may be that there's something in your diet that's contributing to this\nUh it's also possible that bacterial contamination in your nasal passages is causing some information than for that\nAh antibiotics are virtually useless than I Do like the long term effects of steroids um you may want to use clear nasal spray spelled accidentally a A R because it contains silo tall and that breaks up the bio films that harbor the bacteria that can sometimes caused sexist mucus production [noise]\nSo um you know there's some of the things that you can do get the book are dropping out by Jamie ... men there's some good ideas there\nI'm listening to pod cast maybe you can break that cycle it's a it's a it's an elusive condition because there's no quick fix by taking an acid blockers some ear nose and throat doctors recommend that\nAnd they'd only\nBelieve me it's the problem in about maybe ten twenty percent of cases I mean you get maybe some relief but it's not making it go away and the long term used to that protects a has some down side effects so see if you can uh\nUh try more natural approach to believe ... thanks for your call a this on him you know earlier in the show we talked about the anti inflammatory diet and its benefits and a part of the any inflammatory diet\nIs Holly fee no rich olive oil that's the mainstay of the Mediterranean diet which has been found to be so helpful for prevention of cardiovascular disease cancer\nUh all manner of health problems and did you know the ... and its peak of flavor nutrition right after it's fresh pressed at harvest time uh it really is a fresh fruit\nAnd it sits on the shelf for a long time it gets transferred it loses its potency that's why my favorite all of our lives delivered to me direct from the latest harvest thanks to the fresh pressed olive oil club as a lizard too intelligent medicine\nYou can now trying a bottle of their finest artists little olive oil normally thirty nine dollars for just a buck with no obligation to buy anything else I've been enjoying these harvest fresh olive oil for years they've been great with my summer meals\nAnd they're far and away the brightest most lively and flavorful olive oil that I've ever tasted there any oxygen and content and Polly female content are off the charts because they're fresh heart is the next door but all the oil taste dull and flat by comparison taste for yourself\nCheck out this generous trial offer and get your thirty nine dollar bottle for just a buck new obligation to buy anything else visit my favorite olive oil dot com and that's no understatement that is indeed my favorite olive oil my favorite ... dot com\nMy favorite olive oil dot com for the special offer get a thirty nine\nDollar bottle of fresh pressed olive oil for just a buck\nFor right let's take a call now from a gym in why only boy we're getting calls from all over the usa\nHi Jim my dog how are ya good thank you\nUh I'm eighty four and I and the U.S since\nI had my first ...\nCalled on I guess by an irregular heartbeat and discovered that I have some ...

to our fifty nine affiliates across the country we're so excited to bring you are show coast to coast and again that's a show or your Justine you want to catch it entirety you can get the podcast version\nAnd you can get that ad stain young show to point out tonight to into pretty much an all the pie cast directory and we have a volunteer along the line with us he is the author of the longevity diet\nI gave out there you are just kind of going through the pillars the first killer when you know using science and research the take us on to the next pillar there's five of them\nIs the second building is epidemiology so what about the studies of a large population of for example and we shouldn't be Bobby Rush on protein intake in the United states\nThat turned out that people that had the highest world getting fake but it can be from animal of sources or they can get a am a higher risk for cancer and higher risk for overall mortality\nStopped after sixty five they should get during the Iraq that if she adjusted that somebody was Seventy five\nShane I uh have their little protein to show up but it's very interesting and they came out of these have you been led you to start a new meaning yeah dozens and dozens of Americans are reporting what the\nAnd after Twenty years for law but these was that data collected by this and the center for Disease Control and you see a attracted when you fall out there and you can see what happens and what the risk for and going to hear of a shrinking the is that each particular guy\nAnd and obviously those epidemiological trends change over time so you have to keep updating that that's what would the third pillar be\nSo that would be an all white thing for them to have five ... not just one because you know lots of times you can you can get lots of legal or by looking at a different way but it's a lot a lot of\n'em but the next dealer these ... foundation for the next you know which is a randomized clinical stuck some point\nYou can say I think ah for example or the diet the drug or it's going to be beneficial to somebody a Web diabetes we know one could prevent diabetes okay then then you um you're randomize a group of people and and you keep a one group to diet and another group you've got to proceed or\nOr or uh or just a normal diet and and then you you cash or are they are able to you and then the diabetes or a boss bonnet et cetera so that's a randomized trial\nIs a sort of gold standard for demonstrating you affect all of a particular intervention\nAnd then you have to put that into clinical practice yeah so what's the next pillar\nDidn't actually before we at least I and I were in a ... ... is there a centenarian thought well you know you get a positive result in my eyes and you can have positive results in um\nIn a randomized clinical trials and you know a G ... but you still want to say uh let me look around the world looking let me look at people that have record longevity or do they lose it raised\nAnd why is that in part that was a it's really a service do no harm um a reason\nA and saw for example if you think that a lot of suspicion\nProtein diet is the best uh you look around the world and and and you ask do they consume any longevity record areas\nAre and in fact they do I so whether it's an hour or so dean yeah or Loma Linda California I'm most of these places that have a are known to have regular longevity they have a you know ... ... in a or on the lower side of protein intake\nWell I you know I kind of goes up cutting in contrast to what some people like you know there's all kinds of diets right but some people have just been high protein no there's no that love you but you're you're way as\nDying so based on research making your own and in others as well and it works it works for longevity and doesn't it all to work for like disease prevention\nSo I mean some of it is devastating if someone with a it is under investigation but certainly\nUm the what you eat a very clear now um I haven't done that but others have looked at a monkey or twenty five year long a study in monkeys\nThey showed that the dies restriction um was able to uh a reduced a completely eliminate diabetes and the monkeys\nAnd read these kinds of us 'cause he's by fifty percent ... Iraq and reduce cancer by ... percent like your show that incredible effects and and this is somebody who's monkeys a but also the human data keep Jeff staff\nWould that work we've done to check that you can have tremendous effect uh by dietary intervention and the risk factors for diseases in humans\nUm saw if you are if you put it all together and then you conclude that um is it about longevity but it's also about avoiding as many of the chronic diseases as possible\nYou know in your book he mentioned the centenarians studies and we've had the the guys that did the blue zones and a lot of the restrictions that believes down on him for our listeners those are the areas in the world where people live along is that what share your take on these centenarian study\nThis say that as I as I mentioned is that is one of the killer is one of the five dollars and a very important to butter of course I always say you can do just that right you have to match you with the science to the clinical data because there's lots of things are centenarians do that are not necessarily that good\nFor you to lock in Cincinnati for example in southern Italy have record frailty um so what does that mean that they're just fairly weak and the only long but they they're weak you know they don't have many diseases they have no lower level diseases of the week so that that you don't want that\nRight so why why do you why do you think they're weak is it the lack of a mobility are black a protein in later years\nMaybe uh maybe like ... the local brought in like a new shipment for sure lots of them you know may not keep up with eating all the things that they need to eat\nA lack of exercise you know for example no didn't need in order to Europe they're famous for being more outdoor type should they compared to southern Europe or during the older to use my maybe not earlier but after\nAfter the audience you seem staying home though that that identity and a U.S so there's a big change between now at least you know what people used to do many years ago on what people do now and I love the southern European elderly\nOr they don't or they don't get out that much they don't do sports they don't do much walking even as they don't do much to live in Salt yeah so that is probably contributing to making him trail and uh so yeah so yeah you want to learn from the from the centenarians absolutely\nThat's the tradition that say history but then you want to find a common denominator with the science and the clinical work and say okay this makes sense\nThis seems to be something that ah it's extremely unlikely that it's going to do any harm and it's very likely that it's going to\nOptimize held the longevity\nSo I guess some people say you gotta eat five or six times a day I I I don't think you agree with that haven't read your book but at well how many hours a day should we plan on eating and how many hours a day so they plan on fasting\nLee is safe way seems to be twelve twelve I'm\nYou spent a few problems metabolic problems a few problems and ... it should go longer you start the promise for example Goldstone formation and the need for a gold led operation of people in fact sixteen Eighteen hours a day they may lose lots of ways and have lots of benefits\nBut he also studying heavy probably that's one of them both on\nThe other one is a many of the people there as fast or sixteen hours a day we'll skip breakfast and now that has multiple epidemiological studies\nRemember one of the killers and showing that people just keep breakfast and to do worse\nAnd worse for the Alaska in these wars for for for diabetes worse for almost ...\nSo not a good strategy to start doing something that for whatever reason I'm not saying that that's necessarily because of the fascinating but certainly that's one of the things that you kind of have to do if you're not going to have ... you're going to fast for Fifteen just you know\nBut with the exception of Loma Linda which is you know basically due to the uh religion right ah folks out there having a you know avoiding alcohol and and and then since I've been ... yeah so I mean that that one that's kind of a say a cultural\nA unique even though they're\nNot isolated as much as some of the blue zones\nYeah I well in the blues are they talking about Mormons in seventh day Adventists and there was another religion I Can't remember that they had the same thing they lived longer but a lot of it had to do with that that healthy lifestyle the not drinking not smoking and such\nI think it was interesting Dr long ago with polluted to having an adequate protein diets not access of protein for so many fat dies ... died the carbohydrate restricted diet but it really all comes down to a balance and not overdoing anything well you know it it\nIt starts out if you know when people come in and that you did this I'm going to do died or paradise good ideas like\nYeah if you cut the sodas and the bread out and you're focused more on your bidding proteins but at some point then they're going to have to refine that so there's kind of still learning stages move through if you can just get them to start making\nConscious decisions about what they're eating and what their nutrition is then you can advance them on\nBut the analogy I Would use is just like it's been well studied what influence from a nutritional standpoint much different than what we as adults need right All right but it hasn't been as much studied what two older patients you what do we need is we get older and now you're seeing data come to that point of sixty five you need to start increasing the protein intake\nUm you know you also need to start increasing the iron so iron and younger men not such a good thing but as we get older as those guys need more our men and women stays about the same thing except when they're pregnant\nAnd sometimes they can have issues of low iron when they're pregnant\nBut actually the new National Book women's ... pretty much the static throughout their adult life versus the guys I think that is well obviously with nutrition they're always in order to fish and just a state you know 'cause they're losing some even put so\nYou know for their body compensate you think yeah they they need a higher and higher than the guys do for the most part too but you know changes

Everytime you go to a new state really living our current duty station for a year so there are many people who are going to be unemployed for the year ... simply because they can't get that licensing or\nIs that something that within the spouse community out at like Leavenworth where you are now and your previous duty station is that something that you found to be a\nRelatively common issue between the the the spouses who are supporting their spouse but having difficulty themselves\nAre overwhelmingly counting it really is I I\nI Would say a vast majority of people I Know are going to be unemployed that fear at that particular duty station I I Know that employers can't say that they don't hire you for being a military spouse um but it's absolutely the case they can see it when they walk in the door you're overqualified I've even been known to down my resume down to get jobs\nAnd I feel like that's something I should never have to do or not\nAnd that's one of those interesting things that you bring up that we've talked about on the show many times before where\nThey can't come out and say like we're not going to hire the Laurent hope she's going to be gone in a year would be her when there's someone\nWho's maybe not quite as qualified but it's going to be here in the long run they can't say that but you can't stop them from thinking you can stop them for saying well we're not going to hire you why not just not the right fit for the job why not just not they don't really need to divulge\nTheir reasoning behind it so it's one of those are the optics of it or like okay it looks nice that they're not not hiring you because you're a veteran or a military spouse or whatever but is that the reality\nBut you know what they're missing out on a lot they're missing out on the mavericks I mean we can make everything out of nothing we've had to move over and over and reinvent ourselves reinvent our family where we live we have to reinvent our tribes that we can do it I Know we can't say that military spouses are the\nAre the unsung hero in the you know the the the trip goes into work but someone else has to sign all the kids up for school and the doctors appointments and the dentist and re enroll in all of the things that in just get everyone back into a normal\nNormal group um\nIf we can do that year after year and not break our spirit but come out stronger on the other side you have no idea what we can do for your business that's very true but\nThe truth is of course that it's difficult for those jobs to to last because you are going to move as you said you're in Leavenworth for a year and then on to who knows where and you know there's probably a McDonald's in both places that most companies are fairly localized\nOne way around that we've talked to several people about this is starting your own business you can bring with you and that's what you've done or of course being in the war and hope who's the founder of hope designed limited so first off which just talk about what exactly your business is what do you do with hope design\nI hand craft jewelry edits of military thing both vintage pizza as well as modern pizzas and I make pizza to support our military community we have expanded into patriotic jewelry for all the amazing red blooded Americans out there that want to support us we appreciate you\nAnd this is the job that move with me uh fortunately grown enough that I can put my money where my mouth and hire other military spouses to help me in the operations and we've created jobs that can travel with them too so we can all work remotely together\nWhen we return\n... or jewelry or whatever [laughter] were you ever trained in this or something you picked up as a hobby\nI it had been a hobby since I was a little girl and when the craft of cooking I left my life over time I I still enjoy it but we do it at home is not the scale I needed to keep my hands busy until I'm completely self taught amazing what you can find on YouTube now a days and uh\nI'm just asking questions it's seeking out mentors how it's said\nHow did it happen but you decided to do is business because it's a big leap going from a hobby that you enjoy to actually making it your profession when was that decision made and how did it come about\nSo uh my youngest son was three weeks old and I'm sure it was in a sleep deprived days that I looked at my husband said I'm so I have this idea and I'm ... I'm going to I'm going to bar a little bit of money I'm going to start the business and uh it's it's an ongoing joke between that they said I\nThink that's such a good idea [laughter] but he came or make good man for it and uh the joke to this day is it's whatever his gut instinct is about the jewelry business I just go completely against the grain and it works out incredibly well so he has the best business partner I could ever have\nWhen it came to producing a product\nHow did you pick a you know like the military the than the patriotic themed a jewelry that you do with the uh the brute your broach broach Roche I never thought I'd never wear one so I Would do but when you decide well how did you decide on that particular design wasn't something that\nFriends have seen before that you would made and they asked about or how did you come up with the idea to focus on that specific\nSo the tradition of approaching the military it's actually generations deep um had been working with a gal Charlene rushed in for her she did it for over Thirty years and um I ended up hurting her business and carrying it on and\nSo the the way the bridge it's got started for me and my husband taught military history\nAnd the United states military academy and so he and his friends are heavily into a military history books and and the collectors world the pieces when they break lady the insignia uh\nUnfortunately they're scrap in that world and so they started collecting for me and that's how I came across all these amazing center pieces for the roaches was giving his three new life\nThe ... that's not the only thing that you may be that but that's what you started out doing was the ...\nThat's when I started doing and it it was a very steady snowball from there and so we've got everything where I'm now license you mentioned from Connecticut or the Waterbury button company all of a uniform buttons in Connecticut and they were just tickled to death with George so they've open

are a veteran or serving in the military and like going to the sporting events concerts or any other type of live event you might want to check out that ticks they're a nonprofit that's been around for about a decade now providing tickets to a wide variety of events at an extreme discount\nHow extreme well earlier this year some vet took members went to the Superbowl for Fifteen dollars\nJust before that some other vet took there's went to the college football championship game for Fifteen dollars\nAnd quite a few have gotten to see Taylor Swift toward this year for you guessed it Fifteen dollars and that's Fifteen dollars total what'd you get one or two or more tickets to any event on their list\nAt this point over five million tickets have been provided to vets in the military by that ticks with over two million being provided in the last two years alone\nAnd that number is short to grow even faster with Bette takes announcing birthday which will provide the same services to first responders I spoke to marine colonel Steve Weintraub the chief strategy officer of ... about the history and future of his organization [noise]\nWe get donated event tickets and those event tickets can be to ball games can beat a concerts it can be a performing arts could be\nChildren's events it could be mixed martial arts fighting you never know what kind of events we get but these tickets are donated by by performers by artist by management groups by Venus and even private donors so these tickets get donated\nAnd then um we do is we turn around and we distribute them to ah to our members and\nSo we'll talk a little bit more about that but we started\nTen years ago um we're we're actually you know it does our ten year anniversary so we started back in two thousand eight and what happened was our um our founder and CEO was at a Super Bowl and in in Glendale, Arizona and where where\nWere based out of Phoenix and so he's a ...\nAnd he was at the game with his buddy who's a fellow veterans and their their their they watch the or the color guard march on the colors national anthem scholars march off\nAnd they noticed that there's no seats for the color guard after they march off they were ah they're ah stay and watch the game but they didn't have any physical seats that were in the ... level\nAnd so I'm R. C. E. O. like he was looking around and he noticed throughout the game that there was empty seats are literally seat the super bowl that weren't used to he came up with the idea of a\nYou know how can we get these unused seats how can how can he get these tickets to unused seats\nAnd turn around and get them into the hands of veterans service members so they can attend these events and bring their friends and family so that's how the concept started and it started locally here in Phoenix, Arizona but\nSince then it's it's more into a a nationwide organization\nWe've got over nine hundred and forty six thousand that takes members what we called the pictures and we distributed over five point three million tickets since we started\nIt's really an amazing program and as I said\nI have now used vet ticks as you mentioned mixed martial arts that's a one of my favorite sporting events to go do that actually worked in may as well there's a promotion in Maryland called show gun fights and there were tickets available there I entered for those tickets I received them and ended up paying something like\nFifteen dollars for tickets that what it costs three hundred I mean is it always that kind of a deal is it are are so many of them like you know coming down from hundreds of dollars down to Fifteen twenty bucks for a ticket\nYeah absolutely and and so that's where the these tickets are donated their their donated by by donors and I'm\n... there there is a small transaction fee for for these tickets but it's never going to be more than fourteen dollars in Ninety seven cents and that's not per ticket that transaction regardless of what the face value of those tickets are because number one I'm\nYou'd pay a couple of bucks for some tickets you got some skin in the game\nSo you're going to go and data obviously makes our donors happy because they donate tickets what are they want they want ... seats and in this case it's just it's veterans currently serving military their families having having a good time so at that kind of um\nTo get tickets at at that type of a deal\nYou can't go wrong\nYou really can't now what is the process for for someone who's sitting out there are things and what do I do I just go to the website and log on and there's tickets and I just click on them or are there different ways that people can get tickets or how do they go about\nSo sort of get tickets you have to be a vet six number and ... and we we call her vet tips members of that chips are so Eric you you you are that ticks are just so yes and um so what happens is it that you go to our website that ticks dot org the E. T.\nT. I. X. dot ORG\nUpper right hand corner it'll stay creating account so you click on that and it it's going to ask you some questions and we verify your service or either as currently serving military a veteran honorably discharged veteran already\nImmediate family member a service member killed in action and so how we do that is id dot knee is neither a vacation process that we used for that so if you're already a member of ID me it makes it that much easier so it takes three to five minutes to sign up it doesn't cost anything to sign up\nOnce you get signed up and verified\nThen you'll start receiving emails about of dance and your area so what happens is is that when you can ... your ah as you're signing up it'll say hey I Want to be notified of advance within you know there's a drop down of X amount of miles within my location so you'll get daily emails every morning\nAbout advance in your area or something you're interested in you click on that link and you put in for the event ... and it's that easy is\nIt really is quite pay was again I've gone through at once now and I plan on going through it again we do keep an eye on it to see what we might be able to take the family too and there's no shortage of events in fact\nI remember a just a earlier this year during the college football national championship\nSeason as we were getting closer and closer to that game there were actually tickets to a bad event available through vet to so you know this this isn't just a small local events or say a baseball game at the end of the season when the team is having trouble uh feelings than there is a really major events aren't there the\nYeah absolutely I mean we had um we had two tickets donated to us by a vet ticks or\nA to the super bowl in Minneapolis this past season so there you just never know what you're going to get uh this this that ticks are huge biking span bought bought the tickets or early in the season in the hopes that the Vikings were going to go when the when the Vikings um\nYou know fell out of contention he had no desire to go so he donated them to bet ... some lucky that texture and the uh local Minneapolis area gutsy the super bowl two tickets for for Fifteen dollars so\nSometimes these tickets they might be up in the nose bleed or they might be courtside or behind the dog out of the New York Yankees so you just never know a kind of take it you're going to get\nEven as I understand that you guys are growing significantly I mean there there's a lot of people signing up every day for the program that's going to be expanding even more because you guys recently I think just in the last couple of months and now you're going to include first responders and this is well is that right\nAbsolutely yeah spot on and so what we've done is we've opened this up to first responders so that includes a police firefighters and EMTs and um and there's\nI'm ... and so sometimes that's a factor but we've got a we've got algorithms that will ensure that number one nobody can game the system so um the you know you're not going to put in for\nThree national games three nights in a row\nAnd you're probably not going to get selected for all three games um so it's part of it has to do with supply and demand but um if if you don't get selected for then you'll get notified but\nUh but you you don't have to say okay I'm just putting it for one event at a time so yeah my my advice is put in for or whatever you see and if you get selected grade if not keep trying\nWe're speaking with Steve Weintraub he is the chief strategy officer of that ticks and Steve let me ask you about this\nAs the CFL of an organization that's had such great success as we said over five million tickets in the last ten years with over a million one point three million coming close one and a half in two thousand Seventeen alone\nWhat is the road map to that kind of success that other people who have you know maybe a similar organization is doing or not operating within the tickets but operating a nonprofit what would you recommend to those people who want to get to the level that that takes has gotten doing such a short period of time\n... you know one of the things that you really made us I'm successful is number one the concept um you know you you you can't deny that but the other thing is is the mission\nUh you know you want to call it a mission creep um we we specialize we only have two two programs and we don't deviate from those so um we stay focused on our mission\nAnd but what we also do which made a successful is partnering with other quality\nVS those in in the veteran space and so um you know we we have strategic partners uh to include armed services YMCA VFW ... the\nNavy Marine corps released society and because we don't we don't do the things that they do and we don't try to but what we do is have these informal\nPartnerships with them where we can refer our members to those organizations if they require do those types of uh resources and we promote them at our strategic partners to our debt pictures and vice versa so\nPart of it is is just playing well in the sandbox and having having a good mission and sticking to it\nYou can find out more by visiting ... for first fix dot for\nAnd that's this hour of CBS eye on veterans if you've got what veteran for individual or organization helping vets that you

O. T. C. I mean it has a range of around\nIt's like twelve hundred dollars to up to Ninety six hundred dollars that they can get a for simply hiring veterans that's classified as a disabled veteran now there are other sources out there that basically if you're the company and I'm the veteran that I can get a\nStamp of approval that basically at the time I come and apply for a job what your company and I met my pay for that seals that blue seal that comes with it um\nIt tells you right away what I represent walking into the door so could it be something that's on a on a compete level you know if there was me and another person that\nYou know maybe represented forty two hundred and I represented Ninety six hundred dollars but everything else was equal that you might hire me perhaps you know so that's just one example there's others like the returning heroes tax credit a window warrior tax credit which also has another up to Ninety six hundred dollars so there there's various of them out there especially state by state\nUm I I Know that they're ... a lot of people a lot of employers believe that hiring somebody with disability is going to be dragged on their their business what are some of the common misconceptions that employers have about hiring people with the\n... one of the things that we've seen we've all seen you know the ... you know unfortunately the media can have a tendency to portray\nA disability such as post traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury in a completely negative light and it usually comes\nComes that way if something tragic happens and we find out the person's veteran then we find out the person has you know as a combat veteran and and the list goes on and so it's stigmatized a way way out of proportion and\nI'm so there are you know there are companies in fact the company straight out asked me one time at a at a summit I was at that what can they do to screen for post traumatic stress disorder\nAnd that's absolutely the wrong angle I think the intent that was probably a a Ernest intent behind it like in other words what can we do to understand it more I think is where the questioned arrived but it wasn't the way it was asked and so it it came across simply is that they may be screening for\nYou know to eradicate a particular thing when in fact uh that's that's just bad business to do\nYou could find out more jobs dot D.

he's not in special education he talks looks exactly like you know his\nPeers there's nothing that if you talk to him for about five minutes you wouldn't even be able to tell that he um has been diagnosed with autism um our daughter Cameron has a little social anxiety but she's five years old and she's also on a regular classroom but our son Daniel um he's three years old and he um is not talking\nHe has to be prompted to um say words um if his tell me it's hurting or if his foot hurts um he's not able to tell me that and like medics rich in North Carolina he is a wonder if you let go of his hand he'll run off\nWell you know what Andrew actually is an advocate for his siblings um and he participates in their therapy he will go into a a therapy center and he will sit in the room and watch them\nAnd he's watched their growth and he's watch their development and he actually can run therapy trials he is so engage with the therapist that sometimes they come out and get him to perform appeared modeling impair tutoring\nAnd we make sure that he takes care of them and he helps them to learn to read and dressed in the field and he is a good role model an example but not only that he\nUnderstands a globally that there's kids that have autism outside of his household and so more than just his sister and his two brothers the impact it but\nThere's a whole community of children who can't speak oh who can't understand simple instructions and who are growing up and who may need a special services for the rest of their lives so Andrew wrote a letter to the governor and\nAsk for more training for police officers or to learn how to deal with people who have autism and he actually was invited to the state capital and I'm spoke with several senators about a bill in the Senate here in the state of Minnesota that funds training for police officers when dealing with people who have autism\nSo he has been an advocate um and he has worked tirelessly to try and help create a better life for his\nSiblings who have special needs and not just for them for um kids who need um special services and they nicknamed him Andrew the advocate [laughter] because he's working so hard to help his siblings\nThat it's awesome to gear absolutely awesome and actually that's been covered by the media out there in Minnesota and local CBS channel I did a story on what Andrew due to bring attention to this is you and it's just another aspect of autism that we we might not consider on a day to day basis particularly those look\nNot living with children affected and not affected by it directly making sure that the police understand someone you might have to deal with a little bit differently when it as\nWell yeah because um we um you know Daniel ... being a wander will run off and you know he might run into somebody's house and that's a cute one he's three\nBut what happens when he runs into somebody's house that he's Thirteen and he's ringing his arms and they're trying to talk to him and he can't respond or top back um they're going to call the police and the the people who live there may be afraid\nUm and so it's so important that the police and law enforcement learn how to deal with kids who can't top court not really a danger um and not a threat but who have special needs um and that needs to be addressed before um any weapons are drawn or or you know anybody's placed in handcuffs\nFor the military families who are affected by this who may have an autistic child and that may have a parent who's deployed for a year or six months or whatever the case may be\nIs there something that the friends and community who know the families can do you think would be particularly helpful when you have a single parent or a deployed parents or something like that\nHappened to local organizations that provide volunteers PCH services um they can be tremendously helpful when it comes to just doing simple things like running to the grocery store\nUm they have sitters that could come into your home and you know sit with you for a few minutes ah there's respite care you know if if you got to a family member has deployed deaths deployed and moms home with an autistic child that's a lot of stress um so I encourage moms to connect\nWith the vote volunteer organization that the broader community to see what services are available that can help ease the burden I'm even thirty minutes a day\nOr can can be helpful um we've had the luxury of having\nSome family means a services come in and help out volunteers to come on Saturday afternoons just to spend an hour or two with the kids playing out back and that's been really really helpful for mom and I are just to get a a mental break up from from caring for the kids you know twenty four seven around the clock\nI can actually take a shower with the door clubs and it's amazing\nI I think all parents understand to some extent the or how things change when you have a child it changes a little bit more when the child has autism what'd you say shorter\nYeah it does and you know that\nThat's not the end of the story though you know when when they diagnose my children or my third child with autism I went into a really really deep depression um I probably lost thirty pounds forty pounds maybe for fifty pounds I stopped eating um stopped communicating with friends and family stop praying stopped going to church and I got to slow down because I\nThought that that was just the the my children would never have a regular life they would never get married they would never graduated from college all the dreams\nThat I've thought a half of my children I'm I believed in my heart that they were over and they would live with me forever and they would never be potty trained and they would never get a high school diploma and they would ban special education all their lives but it's about\nAccess and information and the information that I got was through this applied behavior therapy or a BA therapy that my kids could do better and live better and they came into our home and like my husband said they work with the kids forty hours a week um each child gets that much therapy\nAnd we saw great improvements after just two years and now my kids are in regular classrooms my son Daniel the wander who can't\nSpeak as much as he would like and understand simple commands can actually read a book\nHe can read words that he's never seen before we couldn't believe it we just found this out a couple of weeks ago so now we know we can communicate with him through language the written word and that's amazing I Would never have happened had we not gotten the early diagnosis had we\nBeen in denial and tried to put it all had we not want it to put labels on him and had we not gotten the services early enough to make a difference before school starts and so now I Know that my kids can graduate from college they can get married they can make me a grandma when the time is right because we got the services early enough\nTo make a difference in their lives\nWhat are some of the national organizations that you're aware of that you think would be most beneficial to families who are dealing with all the\nUm like my husband said um the autism society or in their local state um each state has an autism society um autism speak is another a great organization I'm ever university has\nI Know the estimated number of that are that are affected ranges from a hundred and twenty thousand below into over three hundred thousand on the high end\nThree hundred thousand on the high end so if you have two hundred and twenty people I mean they're going to have to do what like Fifteen hundred a individuals' for each of them I mean this is\nNot a good situation and as we've seen with previous deadlines and using the VA ID cards which are to be fair is to get nothing but free pancakes on Veterans Day and that kind of thing\nBut they couldn't get that done where you are out and they've stolen we've gotten a third of those which a similar numbers about three hundred thousand people applied for him about a hundred thousand actually have them so far at last count\nUm how how confident are you that the ... going to be able to fix this before it starts having an even more significant effect on the finances of those veterans go into school\nWell what makes matters worse and really isn't a good signal it is the school is like Antonio banks school certifying official have a hotline they can call and when he called the hotline he has not given a timeline on when students can expect to see payments and when his executive aid called the hotline just last week she was told it had been more than thirty days with some certification is worth ...\nSo it really is a ... issue of window technical\nSystem ... linked up\nWith another part on the Internet and that really is a technical glitch that's the building payments for hundreds of thousands\nOr what are the school certifying officials are able to tell those students if anything what is the best course of action for them is there anything that they can do until those payments start coming in\nIf there are a veteran experiencing a genuine financial hardship the they recommend conga beat customer service number at eight eight eight four four to\nFour five five one that's an important number to be able to call and this is something that could have a significant effect not just on the the the short term finances but I'm a long term educational goals if this drags on and those vets are not being able to give and are not being given their\nLiving allowance for two months than they might have to look into getting out of school because you know what how are they going to know when it's going to get done\nSo you've got to hope that it does get fixed out sooner rather than later on this is a major issue and again or is it surprising to you that they had a year to prepare for this and still ran into these kinds of problems when it was launched\nIt really seems like they kinda got caught with our pants down where the ... they weren't even anticipating this problem and that kind of popped up out of nowhere and they were not prepared to deal with a now again the VA\nHas not really broadcast what they intend to do to needed a media ignored or schools or buying officials and definitely not to to veterans and at a time where student veterans you know going school as a stressful time enough when you don't have to worry about\nPaying your phone bill or paying ... landlords don't care if if if your if your department's check early 'cause they get their their rent on the first month so it really is putting didn't better than a really tough position\nIt absolutely is and it's something that hopefully by next week's show will have a some update on this there will be positive but for now that's all we know that there is a deadline that's already been extended him at the school certifying official they're not even really been given a deadline not good stuff thanks to the same thing for coming in\nHere and discussing that with us and its on that note that will end this week's

he spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC the Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team\nIs the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work comments regrettable welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nKnow I'm well Richard thanks for having me on my pleasure\nLet's talk about Harry who d'nese um how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic of now after death communication he was an of vow to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for\nAll these people that he considered to be fraud where did that have no why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books have your mansion and he really um he um\nHe was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all be what they were the ... and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think it is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake a psychic\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have been some money to get back to\nThat young students who had done the boxing gym to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of a crowd like someone like you or me you know right in there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready\nBut this time with this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all and mussels words for this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen so intense that you know you had those problems and his appendix first and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive\nA medical uh hell he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed work for five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all we had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a tiger for in the newspaper Harry would be wearing skies a magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on to wear their whatever with a hidden string making something like this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and say I'm Harry Houdini any pull off his mask and and so these guys are very sick\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah just writing on beating on Harry right up my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else from it seems that makes sense a few phone calls have you know I mean so I had nothing on hearing you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right anyway\nI thought it would if I just wanted to ask you about briefly about the circle is er Arthur Conan Doyle because they were area and and he were were good friends and yeah it's\nA ... was a prominent spiritual and so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that area was such an of vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friends and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yet this very foot movement is not exactly I'm buying in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't do there is a leader but a lot of people looked at the oil as the leader of spiritual as a matter of friendship starting it around Nineteen twenties for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fans just fan crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but\nEventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil why who gave a I think it was a\nWhat do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that\nHe brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry mother plays an important\nPart in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ...\nYes yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no heart of this debunking that that uh Harry and bats engaged in would be to sort of demonstrate against the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own sort of photos\nPsychic act on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics you may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nI think we should have turned out a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to a and anybody that interested if it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can word in the tens word is actually a friend in each word correspond to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first mad and Eighteen Ninety four I got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer it reaching their pocket ... or I Would have allowed to do this on the coin and they these were rich\nAnd praying answer said now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words and easy sent in like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural and listen to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean all\nRight so if the coins the bats helping her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight and because she would say she's communicating to invariably using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight eight eight were in in the rye secret Cody minutes oh so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nIn other words my mom has been living with type two diabetes for almost ten years so together we want to say to the eighty four million Americans at risk exercise and healthy eating can

the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas his website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time it's quite common so let's get to the other day on a at a Baptist house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there the the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happened\nUm are there for shows up and he Arthur board usually works is his name Fletcher\nAnd Fletcher is in touch with who teeny and this ability for this year worlds communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother in the spirit of the mother was also present make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a a like a show a very theatrical show where hurry would work with that same way they were\nWhen they were on stage and news or as an assistant and and have her up well he was very poetic wizardry very at times very touching and romantic and uh there were statements like throw the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put his hand\nKey word on the table and then they did coated than and after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that's his nickname that\nHarry used for her with Rosa bell and this came about real popular fall right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was rose about ...\nAnd it's really really touch them and she was very very strong and clear and your language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted that anyone knows it or to Ford no that Roosevelt was the name for better with the common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read the other day on the Internet 'cause I'm trying to brush up on this kind of stuff someone said that there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bad who is Twenty years older than he is he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of the hour that Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find that incredible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that they've been quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but to believe is actually came through the decoding of those other\nRight and again he just he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher just didn't show does the word believe they use this secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look and be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes yes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nHere's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry died ... she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nA you know and so all of a sudden\n... she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do to stay on it and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the GOP will be higher closer to God and the stairs anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it a\nSafe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back with my friends and embrace the standard\nMainstream believe\nBy your inclined to believe\nThat the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur forest been contacted by herbal loving Harry that that that are quite possibly happen\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that you wrote to wind chill and also it has a fair amount of passion

in U.S Russia and the er the programs and the the the the forced a started nations in the Ukraine and so forth\nUm but uh let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about it someone born with a silver

... they were just sitting in the news or the old world well I mean there are ground where quarter mile down the road as of anger deal man\nOn the show on basic parcel of land I mean to say that this

you know I mean this is the evolution of this person\nIs cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nI think it was a second ago right\nAnd and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nAre well they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't thrilled about what does that lives just not the way that he was raised by that Roosevelt name that was done anything to frighten people had to do was\nUm ordinarily a bowl along the specials that comes out so he can get a lot of things around and say look back and yourself on marrying\nThis person then you're spending a maverick tight Roosevelt you know that and so there is awful lot of weight so he was a benefit from the Roosevelt may as well\nRight and he was also governor of New York and you know he was he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nAnd it has to happen that way through the history that's for like there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have a sort of\nI think of George Bush senior trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous TV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of August and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter]\nIt's funny how they it's funny how they live\nAmongst us but

been\nPresident but it's certainly changed the trajectory of his life as you would imagine it would but also his politics talk to me about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this is where I had gained a lot of a lot of respect for the job was not necessarily you know the ... and I'm not much social personal but you know when somebody comes down and we're

course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banks system it failed and just to paint the picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had orangutan going and the person in the number the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWere starving children will be able to afford luxuries and the country over got in trouble with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on I'm sure that fast and ah you know so here comes FDR in ...\n... says there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has a slow motion of legislation\nI'm In a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of help for a lot of people would put people to work and it was on the government or the governor of paycheck and um this was the experiment from the communists\nThe communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're in New York City\nOr and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class and there was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point\nUm you know America is an economic chaos they know they have to get into this war for many reasons to the ... the economy as well and uh it was just in the he had to FDR was putting a real bad situation\nAnd you know in the first chapter of my book I paint FDR is kind of a villain and I have to do that to set up a murder so I Apologize in advance for anybody to read that and get your town when FDR had to sell\nOur country on this war and I believe he had to sacrifice Pearl Harbor and the lives that and there was a terrible thing to say but I uh I think that's that's how it happened\nIn order to galvanize public support right yeah 'cause he he had already been saying this is Europe's war this is Europe's\nWere well between the the ... the global economy which was not doing anything in the necessary time to get into the war coming through our spies and it was he knew it was time to break gut wrenching decision\nVery gut wrenching decision so that that's a that's how that came in to pass you\nKnow before we get into the U.S in World War two and FDR's relationship with Churchill and and then later style and I'm not never been about sort of the enemies list that he had already cultivated through the overregulation and and then with with the big corporations in the United states\nOh boy ah [laughter] this guy had a you know there were\nHe hated money you relate to and ... as much as he get his hands on stuff um and he really\nAnybody who is interested in industry are making money it was definitely not as friends I mean he really pissed off some powerful people\nUm I'll go

that's just the way it is a fact\nUh and and I think they kind of ... a mutual admiration society going back and forth I think\nUm when Mussolini was still writing for this worker party magazine he admired Roosevelt Roosevelt wanted to send a delegation over to Italy to see how they did things so I I just thought that was kind of an interesting chapter but\nWhen they entered the war\nRoosevelt wanted a pact with the Soviet Union to kind of squeezed Germany how did that idea go over with Churchill\nWell when it first started to address your emotional anything you're absolutely right with that as a matter of fact Hitler also idolize was when we first he was in awe of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that has to be a little odd\nI'm so America\nGets under the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed the night for\nMore than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the ... in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it and the ... bombings in ... she watched the city's burn\nOn every inch of ... in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um what's really neat that I have that personal contact with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way um anyway\nUh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my editor was there\nHow close\nEngland came to losing your mind when they were lined up on the other side of the day being ...\nGermans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in weight on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of\nYou know church does resolve a and you know we're so we're going to the war and now we're there to help out Churchill\nSo we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course to have my previous way and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you chose the one who got the two together but he he just pay the fact that the Americans because they were so similar to the time\nThat Stalin in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary allied he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nShow to answer your question around about fashion um church elected for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trust that FDR wasn't going to become a style and only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point with FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely he was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been strained but of course we weren't getting there until decades and decades later\n\nRight in the New York times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful show a communist I mean there's like\nThere's still a communist newspapers as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are now doing\nFDR it seemed in reading your book an FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with style and I don't know if this was because he admired him or that he was burned down and was playing a little hard to get\nDown to the neatest\nWe needed Stalin Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course many of us Hitler and it's and Stalin had to pack\nWell Hillary violated the fact and went after style in which completely blue asylum is mine and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego to go over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leaving under the delusion right now that he's unstoppable\nHe's completely unstoppable so of\nCourse we know anything about Hillary's drug habits at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator of the ... this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horse and the train and go to our style when you're at\nUm meanwhile the weather is changing\nA winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want to do it so that one is already reading or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think\nIn a was Turan in Nineteen forty three and again the number forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye at sort of\nCarving up the post war world ah and still at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt your looks pretty robust\nA you know he's you know bite bite\nStandards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him\nAnd you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy um but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to go back a minute and talk about the\nAssassination squad that Hitler was standing over to the United states because I didn't know about that until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nBecause that that can fashions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents are declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders and only crazy so you can really go back in piece together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis by hearing\nWas the largest firing and then they're in history thirty three miners and that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on um operation ... uh was another Nazis firing eight members auditor created after Pearl Harbor\nUm they attacked Chilean targets and has a stake and they were all caught and they said we each one of them except for one seven of them got the electric\nChair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah\nAbsolutely they did but Stalin was closer to that one had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt is I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is this is what I was saying about\nThe parallels to modern day people think oh this was Seventy some odd years Seventy five years or whatever what have you know this you know this was all history is not all his readers repeating itself okay here we have in the White House\nIt's again I'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another of another president who was accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist or you're legally infiltrated a on at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo here give me an example of give me an example in in Roosevelt is White House of some of the economy and and they had each year\nFor the first communist overhead as there was a Monday our house which was a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth that came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were there were hundreds of at least Fifteen higher ranking officials in at the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder test and they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins\nWhich turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety\nAnd I'll talk about Harry Hopkins at a at length later\nSo they don't get bored on your way to work on it [laughter] um\nThe or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated

to get over the story of the old or the girl at Baker grandfather's ashes\nIn the ... she was going through the great ... and the famine in Russia under Stalin and what's really going on ... or or or anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well you never ceases to amaze of when I just wanted to check everything is because people need to know it's you know you're on the east coast is three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you\nBeing here with us and staying up late so I wanted to talk about you know so much of the\nPost World I'm so much of the post war world\nIs a result and then then the ensuing Cold War and and all of that really is a result\nOf FDR's frail condition is greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference and you also in forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon Roosevelt Israel condition\nOr and and um\nFDR really didn't know what happened and he just was so out of it but\nYou you look at those pictures of FDR at the the also conference and obviously is is he looks like death warmed over but seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a fiddle I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nLovers or this boy and we've been talking about the bond that we have a garden much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them um every year as being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here\nTo give this book away but it was a type of poison we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was plentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet\nBut the rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe for Fifteen hundred years old maybe older\nSo in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walden would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poisoning from inside the White House every time he goes away\nToo Warm Springs Georgia\nTo sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so weak and mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or\nOn the advance of polio is joining mud joining muscle weakness or the an increase muscular pain I'm being fatigued or exhausted um atrophy of the muscles trouble breathing sleep apnea and becoming called okay this is the advance of polio\nThis is not the laundry list that doctor Dr Ley he discovered when he that is\nA you know work up on this guy he I'm not going to I'm not going to um boar everyone with us 'cause a laundry list is incredible but everything from cardiovascular to mental an intellectual issues\nSensory motor for ... for such and gastrointestinal his nervous system was shot his kidneys were shot\nHis or he was this heart was racing out of control this is not the advance of polio and this has been kept from us for Seventy some odd years because that memo from from Dr Frank way has been out front legs\nGet terrible tremors to weaken barely holding light a cigarette\nOh yeah it was it was it was incredible he was calling things by the wrong name he couldn't yeah he was just shaking all over the place so here are these doctors um you know mcentire brew in the fall and and trying to figure out they were so baffled they take this guy to a surgeon\nHe's got\nPressure that's out of control and they want to take him there for X. rays\nYou know blood pressure doesn't show up on X rays I have no idea what they had no idea what they were doing but again it's not the fault these men it was time period involved they didn't know what we're looking for so every now and then you get lucky with a murder and I get look I got lucky on this one\nMargaret sock daisy suddenly as one of FDR's cousins and in confidence and she published a book on the fiftieth anniversary of his death and title closest companion in that book in age to all three she writes the following\nThe president's fourth day in bed and he's still feel somewhat miserable although ... gone last Tuesday without any warning who he felt ill at noon also known as new as mealtime okay he lay in this\nAnd it's often so for three PM when Tony and the temperature of a hundred to ... ... ... ... with a toxic poisoning but they couldn't describe it anything they know a\nSingle smoking gun\nHere we have the president at mealtime suffering from a toxic poison in ... in the White House and this is how baffled there [noise] [noise]\n[noise] it's it's incredible I mean were they were either really really stupid [laughter] really naive or maybe I'm not gonna I'm not going to budge away they just irritates me that our President Reagan and nobody incredible\n... what we're coming up on top of the hour we're going to open up the phone lines questions and comments and I know coast listeners will be referring to have at you with a great questions and comments and we'll also talk about\nWho may have been delivering the poison uh at Warm Springs in Georgia the little White House\n... my I guess the book is who murdered FDR the true story they don't\nWant you to know and as I say we're going to open up

C. I got everyone from\nRescuing the apostle John in the Bible and poison and political poisonings hit their ... right around the renaissance Italian Renaissance on the fourteenth century ... and even today ... are used in sort of advocate that um you know everything [laughter] and here's some people\nActually I tried to poison other people throughout history\nOr you know it sounds outlandish that our president can be poisoned the span but it's it's actually quite a kind of thing the ... the ... Mark Anthony Neal Petra Queen Elizabeth King Henry the eighth Abraham Lincoln these people all were so worried about boys aren't they all had foods dusters\nBut today we're a little bit more sophisticated about the ... we actually have um in America we have the presidential food safety thing and there's this set up a security zone where the first family can without complication inmates concocted ups\nYou know super screeners and people who watch people prepare the food and\nUh if you get outside of that in the White House's own even the air in the White House and stuff I mean that's what his own right right if you do outside of that if you travel\nUm ... you will go back\nTo having a true testers and they've used everything from military prisoners to monkeys the dogs the taste or the face of the\nUm both Presidents Bush Clinton Reagan and even President Obama when they were traveling were using the same thing so this is this is a legitimate threat I'm In Nineteen Ninety three um Turkey's aids president was poisoned or the Bulgarian embassy when he drink lemonade\nAt a at a reception right the right this is a this is for real thing here um as far as the world war two is concerned\nHow they tried to get rid of each other there were forty two attempts on Hitler's life from Nineteen thirty three Nineteen forty four and even Irwin rom all they knew Hitler was crazy or when Ronald a desert Fox are great in the infantry ingenious he started cool from inside inside Germany\nTo assassinate um\nUh it off Hitler and on July twentieth Nineteen forty four it was discovered is kind of his indication was discovered with other people inside of Germany and they took him from his house and they force them to bite into a cyanide capsule\nSo they were trying to poison and assassinate people back and forth probably the most hilarious up the Winston Churchill ... Winston Churchill like I knew the guy you know\n[laughter] you're like this yeah yeah fresh\nSo um you know they tried to get each other back and forth a multiple times Hitler was going after us so fiercely hit operation long John where he tried to assassinate Churchill FDR and Stalin during a Toronto\nBut possibly the most is the most hysterical of all of these is a page right outta Maxwell smart\nIs the Nazis were very good bomb makers and they knew um the Nazis and everybody had spies everywhere in every in every government enough to they were not all that special we have spies too so [laughter] I'm Churchill they discovered like chocolate\nHe was up or at least oh like find chocolates so what they did is they crafted the German was being crafted\nA bomb or to make it look like a chocolate bar and they there was a bomb and that was um\nMade with thick rich dark chocolate and there was no leveling lovingly prepared or doing raps with gold and it was Peters chocolate and it was placed by one of their operatives who was in Britain on one of the trays along with other luxury items to be taken into the uh\nThe work and and what they were trying to do is they were trying to blow Winston Churchill's head off with an exploding chocolate bar\n[laughter] you can't make this up Richard you just can't do it you know so I mean there's I mean they went back and forth you know all the time doing this so let's fast forward to the uh\nThe innocence now either tae or ignorance of FDR loose taking\nJars of caviar in cases of vodka from Scotland do the same guy who murdered both of his wives and the degree purge I mean it's just that\nIt's incredible how we were we're there either really naive or really dumb\nRight what were the doctors in on it do you think because you know\nJust minutes before FDR you know reach for his head and said I had a tremendous headache and then he collapsed um I think it was his ballet and he would he would he would get give is a lay out a picture of cream and some cruel or oatmeal or something and then it's a it's been described it this glass\nOf green liquid or I mean is that how they get it in that in that classic green liquid and was that the doctor when they connected to that one\nI I you know I'd love to say I know everything about this I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt\nHad was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that'd be are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with the um and she commissioned a private investigator to uh you get to the bottom of his death so I Do know that um\nThe private investigator hit a dead end all of that the medical records were were stolen from a lock violent with us so one of four people had those he's one of them was a doctor and uh it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six roped\nOr the or the book being um\nThe White House physician and that was a ... am or us mcentire where they hand on the murder ... new idea like I couldn't say I'd have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit so ignorant maybe\nAnd and what happened to shoot ... that the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she which has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time for that afterwards well immediately afterwards well they packed\nUp the uh um\nAnd assume it's off and the rulers Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so\nIt was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote\nA the uh the book being um\nThe White House physician and that was a rather them arrest McIntyre were they hit on the murder I Am absolutely no idea like I couldn't say I'd have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit so vigorous maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the ... the Russian pager and her driver and and and um she would jobs has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well they packed up\nThe uh um\nRobbins and shuts off and they threw Lucy Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get out of Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book\nUm her being I'm showing us off in her book she describes the place that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm why I don't know why would why fleet a scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still records you know and if there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually um JFK shot in Dallas\nThey break the law to bring him to a lot of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas\nThey break the law to bring him to besides the you\nKnow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three ... wasn't Nineteen forty five day to the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the besides the so both you know both uh JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know a lot of this besides the good talk you know ... and then they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's and stuff\nTo him in a very they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough you\nKnow ... by the way and no one balding\nMiller autopsy knowing bombing\nIt's just easier and crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on

Koch cooking bad thing going to die anyway All right Steven you want to reply to\nUm\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils\nOkay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have bones lands that okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been you look so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poison systematically boys and\nThat's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio and it's built up very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history there's an awful lot of people who are researching this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as silenced I wouldn't want to rule the world\nHe didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he sent something to look in the in the end of the cough initiatives on one to verify what was going on he was already being there but that was already verified from the two Russians were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nBy John thank you for that to me to sing point there are let's say Hi to James in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning welcome to coast to coast a venue Richard um but my guess for my question for Mr ... to the store banning it in your research\nA then you come across or anything about the ... to ... an attempted coup against a Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nIt did happen if you came across it how close was a show happening\nAnd that that was the ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler in that one of the people involved was a I think it was a guard or did you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come to happening\nUm if it if it did happen if there was\nShifted coups against Roosevelt\nIt's not something that you discussed in the book uh is uh James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I\nThought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did I'm In ... I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is where the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who\nDidn't like him for multiple reasons I'm from you know or suppressing the ah the the capitalist to falling off as as long as he did it would not would not surprise me\nBut I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for your call and sorry I couldn't be much out there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family are probably it's old money so you know just kind of a cheap the Toomey elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all the money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but that that um that FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars and a while so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families and I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company\nA and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and these guys are never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach your name 'til you want to be as best they can you know or something as far as I did I I still get fascinated by stuff somebody will

eight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call that came in after hours\nRight this is Cheryl and I have a five dodge Durango\nFive point\nAnd we get a ... motor over how we are as ...\nAfter a complete engine overhaul I Would be a concern with a lifter tick when you do in a complete overhaul\nYou need to make sure that you properly prime the engine before you fire with a spark plugs out we crank them over with the new oil until we get full oil pressure of ... started to cool down do it again make sure everything is completely full blood out good to go before we fired because if you fire engine\nEven brand new you can have where quickly\nA professional ... manufacturer or a a professional machine is that is putting these things back together\nYes they will be using an assembly an assembly loop I in the friction areas that is going to give it some initial lubrication upon start up but if you don't have that oil pressure brought back up to the level that it needs to be\nYou're looking at an opportunity to score or something very soon now\nHonda Civic VP addition is you know I I I Know most of these nomenclature what year is this car\nNineteen Ninety nine All right and how many miles on this fine automobile\nOr about one Seventy and I got this thing from my grandfather after he passed away gave it meticulously maintained and I'm really darned good at it\nAnd the only real challenge we hear about these inches there was a no one\nI don't know if was a recall or Bolton but I Know they rip it for a while that they had problems with the mating surfaces between the head gas gets in the head there was a cracked block that would occur and ... and and it was but that was something that was pretty well no one on those but it wasn't it wouldn't lead to what you're having happen\nAnd yeah now\nWhat's funny is it's been about five days and it's rotten every single time I've been using the town car you know not taking it on the trip\nThis thing is running like it did before and you know there's there's always been a little league on this car I Would say you know maybe five little drops a quarter of a teaspoon of the night you know kind of thing but not nothing big and yeah it's\nBeen running so like I said I replace the oil and that whole distributor family there and it's been running you know\nLike a top I I just don't understand [laughter] oh God I'm well any\nRestaurant you assume for a second this repair shop was not completely trying to rip them off yeah I Am interested in the start and when it didn't start like he's been having trouble with maybe ... dollar annual it got full fuel\nTo where it was just washed out and the compression was off so they said hey you're gotta you gotta compression issue is engine needs to be replaced it's going to cost five thousand bucks well that sounds real it\nIn that case I Would have said there's no way I'm spending that much money on this older car I'm going to go the Kurdish part not cop pick up a used an inch long if you wanted to keep the car going that'd be a great thing to do that so what do you do it or if you want to keep it going but\nNow that it started I'm going to say well\nHey it starts in runs perfect there's no way I had a compression\nProblem and then now I don't I think we've got an electrical thing going on where we are not well obviously we're firing you inject or is that we've gotten a few women at the flooded out and make it ... you know spin like that with do compression\nThe world what I'm saying is you're going to use your personal financial information 'cause you're ... you're not giving us any measure we're giving you\nKnow credit card numbers report on the other hand if you do want to give us your credit card information we will ... you can add all die on you wouldn't give it to us you've ... to the to the company making the ... the third party merchant that handle were on a ... so we we will sell you a ...\nA teacher we definitely will go under the hood show ... also your car if you need one you have to tell you anything and you just don't find a link to that\nBut that led to Glen in Wyoming Glen you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nUm have you got a two thousand five or ... days or longer afford or hand and when I come to a stop\nOr whether it's a well a gentle stop them from a stop there I was a split second after I come to stop I feel this clump [noise]\nAnd it reminds me of perhaps something like a motor mount may be in park in one direction and when you stop it [noise] flying back down to a ... normal direction or ... percent normal position that [noise] I don't know why I thought of that but\nIt's just kind of an unusual I Would think an unusual curves [noise]\nKind of like a kind of like a golf ball loose in the back of the truck and when you come to a stop it rolls forward just gives you a little too little\nAnd it seems to be a rotational cost him in a you know\nYou do not like something's coming forward or backwards but\nI'm following you I liked that description is it like like the drive shaft and and I would go that way because some of these trucks did have a little rotational issue with the dry chef yolk the front dry chef yolk they would\nAs you come to a stop they just had a little ... the click the is more of a sudden a click but it would it would move and they had a bulletin\nFor people under warranty when they were in warranty out of warranty they just didn't do anything about it but under warranty they were putting in nickel plated drive shaft jokes you remember that can do three huge on Silverado the Hummer age to had a big thing about them\nAnd uh that yeah that that took care of that but it may not be that but it could be that's one thing the other\nLeaf springs was the yeah exactly Shannon the rear lease springs you read my mind\nYeah but I just can't remember what the situation was there was a ... between the spring was may shift\nJust a tiny bit so how we diagnose at one of our guys that are shop has a wireless chassis here is what it's called and it has several transmitters with a little alligator clip and we they're magnetic we\nMap under the metal parts of the body clip them on and then we go inside and we can push the buttons on the unit and look Christians like a really fascinating and you push the button than you can listen to all the parts of\nThe way better than the guy riding the creep are down the highway the vehicle and like the average improvement\nYes which I have participated in many years ago sorry we Murtha um anyway so [laughter] ... yeah so we can listen and see what's creeping in if we hear more of a ... and it may not be a perfect identification but if we hear that there's more of a creek at that dry chefs slip yolk\nThan on a spring we know we need to be in that area to find it and you can almost never find it when you raised none of ... because a car sits at a certain level with the springs compressed a certain way on the ground when you raise it up and everything drops down on suspension you just can't\nYou just can't find it in a perfect world we all have chassis diner was in our shop the run all four wheel and a spot where we could walk under the vehicle while it was on the chassis dynamo doing it's normal liberty thing and listen for those items which would be a\nFour shaker with the chassis die you know I got ... spring\nRelated uh it seems like you would [noise] he would feel the clock right wing downward rather than just\nReally wouldn't be a rotational and I and I and I'm Glad you said that rotational thing because in my head\nI I get that I'm I'm I\nFeel in my head rotational ... versus just the clump of like a golf ball hitting the back of the cabinet and and they're different sounds if you listen to the vehicle we have these things that we call by the order and the orders are you know first order second or third order when you're going down the road your\nYou know your engine is turning at let's say two thousand rpm\nAnd if it's in direct drive your drive shaft is turning in two thousand rpm that doesn't mean you're wheels are turning at that speed because if you've got up\nFor like say a four to one rear end you're turning around the dry chef four times for every one time and the wheels so if you're a click as you move forward goes click\nClick click and that's equal to one two three revolutions of a tire that'd be like a first order like if it's going click click click click so four times for every one time that we'll goes around you know what's in your drive line and we listen for those kinds of\nThings in a a train mechanic over the years will start to pick that up and they'll say that to see these chef click that is not a tire shift or are tired noise or a ... you know drive shaft or whatever it is they can pick those things up very interesting\nGlenn thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one final let's talk to Bruce Bruce you're on the end of the show what can we do for\nA chill [noise]\nSix sure [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] right\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah well that the way that set we use the computer to set it you need to plug it scanned tool in and it'll say\nIt'll say distributor offset in a zero degrees on those so it's there's the computer handles everything you wanted it zero so what you do as you started up and let's say it says plots Thirteen that's enough to turn to check engine light on so what you'll do at that point is you'll move the distributor the direction needed to go back toward zero\nMove it there then tightening down start the vehicle up read the scanner again and if it says plots to shut it back off move the distributor just to hear more tightened it up fired up until the the engine read zero you don't need to disconnect anything you just do that until the offset says\nZero if you have advanced or retarded a little bit they actually called at now instead of a distributor a high voltage switch it's just really which plug it goes to if it's off a little the engine may run really well but it'll burn a distributor cap and wrote her up quickly so\nThat's why they want that perfectly zero so that's how you set it you need a of a scandal\nDon't be scared of that scandal thing it doesn't have to be a really fancy one\nIt can be one picked up at your local auto parts store they can be picked up for as little as ... fifty two hundred bucks for some of the basic ones that just read basically will be two codes and scan data\nBruce how have you know that a Gemini both knew that answer too so that it was just a rod

like yeah it probably won't be don't wait for this but we're just we're going to be Fifteen year round that's it I'm just telling you and you just came right out and he had\nMade a miniature notice before he got onto the plane or inventing helicopter to the winning Iowa yep went to a rally down in Iowa but now there is going to be a public comment period that has to go through in the and the hope is that this can get move fast enough that it will be ready for the summer season in two thousand and Nineteen\nWhy didn't we have a Fifteen year round\nA month ago well I get into your veins and this is why we're explain it so you political people out there that are listening to us tried to let me know listen to an automotive show this is why we're talking about a fuel for your car and this is all all we really do is why it's a fuel in a car\nNo politics [noise] so\nThere is something called read vapor pressure\nI'll put it in real easy layman's terms I was going to the stuffed evaporates OK okay you're put a cup of gasoline on a counter been approved container of course\nIt's gonna evaporate at this level in ten hours this much is going to be gone you put a cup of each ten in this much time\nThis will be gone now remember it's only ten percent of the few mhm so the ten percent evaporates quicker to get the the Ninety percent gasoline still evaporates at the same rate as the hundred percent get okay Fifteen little more\nWell Congress and the EPA and all those guys at all or ... or it's going to evaporate faster so it's you know problem in the summer because we don't want it polluting near let's hold on let's not use that voice for going to try and all that great we've got to be nonpolitical well\nThe powers that be have determined that the hope still up there so it was determined that yes it evaporated and warmer it is the faster it evaporates so winter months where what\nYou had here's the here's the issue though\nAnd see if the if you guys are all in our radio lander are with me on this\nAll the signs UC say a safe for use in two thousand and one model vehicles in up that's the way it's being promoted so if used correctly it's going in your two thousand and one a vehicle or if they're worried about evaporation\nAll vehicles made two thousand and one up and quite a few of them that go older than that are one hundred percent sealed fuel system there is no evaporation called in the fabric of mission system which we talk about on this radio show all the time\nBecause they'll get problematic from the time he don't\nWant the gasoline evaporating into the year because you will if your cars parked without a gas cap for a long enough period you're going to lose that which pollutes the air but also costs you money in your wallet bread take a long time but still you leave a Gaskins says there were no cap is gonna evaporate so they keep it in a sealed containers they seal all this stuff up\nSo it's not a problem so\nNow with that said she kind of know how that works going to it year round\nI mean there's all sorts of stuff you can you worry yourself about how it affects the economy and stuff but as far as your car goes 'cause a lot of motor so\nIt's not going to hurt a thing it's not going to change anything for you as far as you know when you put it in your been putting ten in there for years and I got I'm going to crack

is you've got to pull the switch out check the voltage there see if you got voltage coming out of that wire that voltage should go all the way up to the gauges have you got it at the switch but you don't have it at the gauges you gotta open wire somewhere in between something's not connected good if you do have power all the way the gauges then you need to check\nYour ground if you've got power and ground all your goals are burned out which is unlikely to have every one of them out but one of the two will be gone either you're missing voltage at the switch\nOr somewhere in between because he got a broken wire that use the circuit on the back like the Ford pickup she used to use that actually the gauge yeah like a little printed printed circuit on the back and those can break you can have a little break in there were more the wire plugs into the back of that gauge I think that one's got around\nPlug with the pins but they back and breaking not connect rounds can do it too in that dashed with a weather radio goes in that car makes sure that that wire that goes that same color wire that goes to the back of the radio is not a\nShortage or in the ashtray that the ashtray light is not shorter than in cause and that thing to have a a bad circuit that'll do it to\nThe jackets\nRight other question for a seat by saying the LA well does\nThat mean the oil\nIt sure does does it matter\nOkay I go to war when he runs out that's good\nYou know that's what it is thanks for calling thanks for the call al eight six six five nine for for one five oh what else was caught your attention in the automotive world having news happy news\n... news have you like Chevy Truck some new like for cylinders while the twenty ninth team Silverado we gave me a little wind that it was going to be coming out with a four cylinder engine option\nWell yeah I don't know what do we got going out of that four cylinder engine that makes me nervous when I hear that aren't talking about an engine that's going to be twenty miles per gallon highway twenty miles per gallon city twenty three miles per gallon highway a\nEight speed automatic trans who you're going to get a lot more gear so you can get this thing moving but it's over three hundred horse power in this turbo charged engine now\nIn that particular story that they did it say the toying capacity or not\nNo they don't but we've also got a to point seven ego booze and the Ford which is of the six ... six were just talking to an engine with you know a\nBigger displacement inside because we're putting to point seven leaders of displacement in a force owners compared to to point seven and a six or eight what I mean you could make a to point seven VA you could make a to point seven one cylinder engine if you wanted to I just have a huge pits in the summer the stroke yeah I mean so\nYou can do those things a lot of it has to do with heat this a patient and the block size and stuff like that the Ford is still going to get you a little more uh by means of talking and horse power not a whole lot more but still we were looking at three hundred and ten horsepower three hundred and forty eight foot pounds of torque out of a four cylinder\nIf we go back a to a five\nThree engine or think about that I mean the five three not too long ago was like three hundred and Ninety five or yeah or rent or own sphere of horsepower yeah in a five three V. eight so we're talking a four cylinder with the same amount of power so it is yet to be seen how well these hold up when\nPeople over told them because they get in them and say wildest things got a ton of power less poll like we always have an overdo it um\nWhen you're when you're pushing a\nFive three VA hard and may run a little warmer and it just doesn't go real hard but when you're pushing a turbo charged engine really hard things get really hot turtle usually not a lot of heat oh yeah um I remember a buddy of mine with one of those four cylinder turbo lasers in uh\nNineteen eighty four five and push that thing heart and yeah it went like a V. eight trying to push it hard with super high rpm but the the terrible melted pieces wouldn't the injured and destroyed it so that's not good you know there was way overloaded everyday driving the thing would have been fine for at least thirty thousand miles right\nInto a little worried about adequate headed fifty thousand but he took that thing I'll while it was still under warranty you know it's it's on how you drive but I think it's neat the options that are coming out and what we're getting and just to see trucks that are getting into the\nYou know passing they want to live forever and this will be a great option for some fleets that need a full size pick up bad to be able to put a light things for the job site in ... they're not pulling the construction trailer they're taking a few guys to work and they're and they're put something in the back and let's be honest the great thing for the guy who wants to pick up truck that really need the mini van [laughter]\nI mean it or they are huge part of yeah that's a huge part of that pick up market now is people who just want to drive pickup they don't need to pick up they just like pick ups and they want to drive the curious to see what this was going to\nBe available and they're showing the half done now but will it be available in a um know of other half ton Ford or long box truck I say I think every quarter trying to you know\nI think it'll end but we've already know that will be six cylinder instead of oh we need to fill in there for the full time and yeah and look we'll see what happens let's take a quick break you're listening to the end of the show\nThere's that clicking it sounds like it comes from that are under the dash and just click click click eighty six clicks or so and\nThen that's it and there's also while they're taught for like little worrying sound from a small motor runs out at time off so and then it starts up and then find no more clicking after that it's just by first turn it on\nSo just to make sure this isn't a clicking noises that is stopping the vehicle from starting like a typical power situation we get a lot of calls on if you if you went to crank right away the car would start\nYes it's not like a you know I think the ... on the battery or yeah okay like why does\nNot engage you know it's not that it it sounds like it's coming from and the dash area and and it starts up every time\nA lot of those types of noises and now I don't know me out of that well maybe Russia's had one in we've had experience with it uh but there it's a for I'm guessing they're using fairly common Mazda type pieces and there is probably an actual waiter for the blend doors or the\nThe uh the you know just for the H ... system and they they can they can make a clicking ratcheting noise if they try to index\nOr if there's something wrong with them does all your heating and cooling stuff seemed to work OK wants to get going\nUh yes and I wondered if that was the problem and I don't know enough about the mechanics of it I I turned off the a C and he did that was a picture that was all turned out in it and it still does it on that makes a difference or not\nIt's a good that's a good test to try that whenever you have a thing because we'll have people come in and they absolutely have no clue and they haven't tried those things and others will say well want to turn off the year before I shut the\nCar off if he doesn't make that noise so we've got an I'd faster when that'll help you save money when you go into a technician to be able to point them a direction but I think Janet is right on with it you get something in there\nSomething coming on and it it without seeing it I mean I might sit in and go oh I Know exactly what that is but without seeing you it'll make it a little difficult in this situation if you want to see it or hear it that they see the car here to do it right\nThere you go into it [noise] it's\nBe something in there that's\nIt and it may be a normal operation something you're turning on normally should click on when you turn the key on but there is starting to be a failure in it or if you've got to relate it's getting week it's just kind of bugs in until the vet both voltage comes up on the battery when the old Nader surcharges and then it stops that's a possibility we've seen that\nThe value to me also if you make a mistake\nYou don't lose the board right just make a little ... is a show\nNow we know the product is not only good for above tub walls and showers and shower pans which have the fall built into them the drain systems the linear drain the round grains where it rains the built in ... for soap and shampoo\nSo this is truly is a water proof system that\nI have a feeling I could just take a piece of Kurdi board and I could think of it in the Monterey Bay and leave it there for Twenty years and it it'd be in the same shape\nBut I adored Andrew you started to explain the old sharp and [laughter]\nI Want you to just quickly go through it again we had the more on the wall right which was Swiss cheese water went into the mortar drain down into the pan\nAnd what happened well there was secondary drainage\nCalled we polls writing those old drain a sandwich yes so you were\nCounting on the water getting confined by that time writer and then getting back out through secondary trainers the ... border as you said is very porous would hold a tremendous amount of water for ever let any relief so now you're at a constant water source available for more than ... gross so the new systems are dry\nThere's no water behind the assembly the tile is simply a decorative\n... that's right the whole I'm gonna tell I'm going to say what I said off off a Mike\nThat is some day every shower will be a shooter flew to shower\nEvery single and Andrew accurate polluter in our audience lego where for more

E. D. lighting system that ah we want to talk about a little later on in the show but right now\nOur guest is Deron night he's with a company called their risk\nSo yeah that's our parent company were actually my company's exact where and what do you do Darren so we are a software in a data analytics company we bring in over ten thousand line items from across the country and manage the cost and pricing on those items\nAnd in a leverage that to help builders and contractors estimate the cost of construction okay not labor a labor to yes\nI'm I'm always been curious\nIn our remodeling company we have a few men that work for us ... been working for us for several years\nAnd when we drop cost we drop cost against their labor how they work how they sleep how they waste time how they are are more efficient than someone else or something and when we're finished job costing we know what each man in our company costs right precisely\nAnd those costs plus our markup are put into our estimating system okay how can you possibly tell me from a thousand miles away what my prices are that I Know are in fact perfect what are you trying to achieve [noise]\nSo what we're trying to achieve is help people get to a bit faster\nAnd the way we do that is providing tools within software that make the work for a quicker and then also we provide are priceless that brings out in and within our soccer we give the contractor flexibility to adjust the labor costs that we we bring in and so they can put in\nOur fish and the labor is what all the taxes are associated with having that labor if there's any workers' comp associated with that and with some middle initial set up they can be up and running really quick any job gets faster as they as they did it out\nAnd so we have over fifty analysts that are always surveying the market earned over four hundred individual markets in the U.S\nAnd those individuals are former contractors or current contractors on the side so they're very familiar with common practices and best practices and so this system\nIt's a database that not stripped out it's populated with costs\nYeah so you're looking at material costs all across the country and your populating the database with current material costs correct the cost of a board foot of a red water southern yellow pine or\nYou know what the cost of concrete is pretty hard and I'm going to say that varies across the country and this database is on line is that it\n[noise] well it's not readily available on line to be plugged into our software and we're constantly surveying the markets that direct feeds and all the big box stores so you know what the costs at home depot or above or one of the big big ones is going to be in Baltimore versus where we're at in Utah\nAnd that would be true for electrical and plumbing and lumber and roofing and there I wall and insulation and windows and doors and all of that\nYeah our parents product our core product is based in the insurance industry and it's a it's back to me and it has over Twenty years ago it you guys do have exact to make yeah oh yeah that's a big software yeah yeah so that's where we come from um [noise]\nA composite deck and we see some natural would you see a little bit of a pay you see a little bit of southern yellow pine there's some iron wood and hard with but I think that\nIs about maybe ten Fifteen Percent of what's on display here the vast majority of product being shown if this show is composite back and correct and one of the new trend and composite ... is a waterproof in a system that will allow\nThe space bolo a second floor deck to be dry yes and\nReally think that there are some interesting systems here\nThat are are on display and I think there's about six different choices six different choices but at three different primary methods of making that happen one brand new that we had not previously seen which is Bexar dry D. E. X. P. R. D. R. why it is a gas get on a roll\nBack is a place to between the pores that one\nIs a kick yeah that one is a real real kick\nIt just a piece of rubber yeah it's a rubber gasket nothing else and goes into the groove of one board and into the groove of the adjacent\nBoard now we have to say of course is that this particular product\nA must be installed when the deck and has installed it cannot be retrofit that probably has to be installed at the time of the deck and ... but the other system which has been around for years and years and years is a system where in you place\nPanels many under side of the day right they go from ... joy to debt Joyce that's not capture the water that's been around five yeah and they're a half dozen different brands and styles that we've seen a and that area so that the second the third of course and this is something that\nIs much like the second choice this too is done from the underside but it is a monolithic\nSort of finish kind of like a beep or look if you will a sided top yes that captures the water and then runs it into a gutter ended with layoffs onto a trough and then with down about and that's a haven under deck\nA little and twenty five colors mix and match yadda yadda the one that I like the most\nWhich is the easiest and least expensive is the gas ... do you like the gas gets around like after the deal with the gas could of course is that you need to be building a deck in order to make that how yeah of course would be willing to disassemble your existing back yard over talking ... ... a on a second floor right yeah\nSo we're going to move from decks deciding another big category here at the remodeling show and deck expo because citing has so much to do with your parents of your home the durability and\nThe curb appeal and value and we are joined it our broadcast location by Andy's dry and Andy is with diamond coat building products Andy welcome to the program thank you very much guys morning so tell us a little bit about diamond code building a house in what you're exhibiting here\nSo just like you guys it's a diamond called building products reprieve finish fighting products or recreate a fighting system so we have a lot of different components to make sure that we have a good quality terrible fighting product but wait a minute right now wait a second\nAre you making siding with a coating on it for you coating someone else's citing or both\nA little bit of both okay we're we're a little bit unique uh we did an L. P. smart tied substrate we we buy directly from lp we bring that into our facilities we do some enhancements to it we and then we put that dynamic will finish on there so we we saw a pre finish dieting product that built on Yelp you smart tides substrates so\nOkay so you buy a Tesla that's unfinished suggests was delivered to your shop you paint the Tesla and you put it out for sale\nYeah got current allergies a great analogy we we we often referred to it but if you take a afford nothing's easy off line you're bringing in ... make it better faster easier to drive more fun to drive and then he fell ill for a little more money that's how we are so\nIf I'm a builder if I'm a builder and I've gone through planning in my community and I've got a small subdivision and planning says we want this yes we've approve these elevations we've approve these architectural treatments and so on and we've improved these colors\nIf five ...

distribution channel we don't all director contractors but we do our through distribution channel we offer thirty standard colors of identical finish and we can do come from callers as well\nSo why diamond coat why what does that mean I don't have to pay or does it mean I Will have to paint less frequently or does it just mean I Do have a debate but I don't have to paint initially can I wrap a piece of hiding around my finger and then give it to my wife and I said this is the diamond or\nI've always wanted at all so diamonds obviously right they're they're beautiful there long lasting so that's where the name darnel came from so diamond code is a product of the pre finished that you're going to last very long time we have a Thirty Years' ...\nOkay so it doesn't prevent me from painting but the value proposition is one\nDon't have to paint the product when it immediately installed it's finished a and we know hearty for example has a pre finished product as well and not wait about wait a second he said that you don't have to touch it for thirty year right\nThe said hey you know he didn't say that he said they have a well known fade warranty but if I Choose I and feel the need I can painted ten years depending upon what the elements have done to my side\nSure maybe you bought that house or maybe you changed your mind that color and like all you want Fifteen Years from

I Am fascinated by how tradesmen do their thing and it doesn't make any difference what tradesmen whether they're a Mason or an electrician or a\nDry wall person who ever is doing it I Love to watch them and I especially love yesterday's demonstration because I think your product\nIs just from your product fan I Love watching it be installed\nAndrew one of the important\nComponent that goes along with\nA shower installation in an environment is a grain\nI Try and in the last several years we've seen grains evolve from just the traditional round grain\nTo a maybe a square drain and then what we refer to as a a linear drink\n... yeah they don't they don't like to say\nTrench strain anymore yeah yeah that sounds like something you put in front of your garage door that's right that's exactly right that the trains on the inside of a linear drained his great great\nLinear drain the linear drain is the female trench green\nAll I like that the more feminine very [laughter] then of\nCourse well and using them for years with you guys might think I used my first one about seven years ago and I decided to do a drain that did not have exposed metal\nIt was kept in title the pilots and had beard Brian it disappeared so for our audience listening whether they're pros or designers who are spent to find products for a project or whether they're homeowners who have an interest in redoing their shower ...\nHelped them selected during sure well one of the things that they're going to look at first it was like you just mentioned during the difference between a point drain round or ours are square which tile setters pretty strict square\n... ... ... square feet square word of square guy that Oscar so that's been tile setters who use ... ...\nWell yeah and then you're still cutting round round around after I got even more difficult to even more\nSo those of if you think about it the reason those were so popular and the only choice for so long is because the the shower pan the part that you stand in when you take a shower slopes towards drained from ... all around the parental rights you're limited to the size tile you can put on that shower pass\nRiley inches square for maybe five you can get away with because of the compound slope the nice thing about a line drain and why they're so popular is because you're not limited to the size tile you can put just about anything very well that's right there's one flat plain sloping down towards the ... which is situated usually at the ...\nThe back we know that we're seeing some of the drains come forward ... which is a complex if you're building an addition a little more complex if you're doing the renovation do you have to re can figure the floor and that sort of thing that drives moving climbing around right for the deal\nIs that the drain in the front\nAllows you to build up the ... the back part of the ... in the shower in the shower mhm making the\nInstallation after the fact in remodel\nSo much less expensive can we\nDo that with the with the Kurdi a board a\nYes they're slope to Kurdi Boris low trays the slur trade and so we can do that and build up the back of the shower with the slope courting tray which comes down to a fraction of it into a little bit is equal to ... work in harmony with the linear drink that's right if you recess the floor\nUsually the thickness of the ... regular records on ... and you about are the truck which is our uncovering membrane that's also waterproof yes to the front of a trend that only out your ... and not only know step and not only is that an on toppling membrane but it will accept\nTo the wire for the Detroit heat ...\nRight you can do all in one fell swoop without rebuilding the room\nAs you can drain the shower\nUse a linear drain the opening to intercept the water to intercept the water\nThen tile all the way out to the bathroom door and not have to use the shower doors for\nCurb or change your title size that try everyone's picking such large format tile very invoke exactly and they want to carry that same large\nSay that again I like the very end vote very and vulgar area like that but no but but I mean look at let's get from both which is pretty and that is nice because I got to go to news and let's talk about us\nAging baby or and let's talk about accessibility and let's talk about walkers and wheelchairs and being able to get into that space easily\nThat linear drain back ... system that you're offering makes it very easy\nVast rise to navigate it is all of our components incorporate into the aging in\nPlace a movement if you will yeah that's so important for all of us baby\nBoomers it's true who want to stay in the house and we've been at you not want to move so the renovation is still beautiful to look at but it does actually function to see that function and design and you had the capability to stay in that home because you do have access you can build a barrier free\nThat's not just know curb that means

R. dot com and speaking of which we are joined at our broadcast location by Andrew Hacker in Andrew is with floater and Andrew thank you for sharing this hour a little bit about something that's near and dear to our heart and that can be a significant value to our audience and that is\nHow do you choose a contractor tile contractor ... well what the mother to do how do you\nWell you know you got to do a little homework right\nOr you should always get three beds I always when I was a contractor\nAnd you were in our area I was how contract I'm surprised we never cross paths we\nDidn't I saw your signs on digital some homes good this this remodel or this homeland security brothers why Roger act well we're going to we were we were in the same area we were in the same stomping ground\nEven when we want to do we're one of the few contractors in our area\nAs there are few and every area who actually put up a sign\n[laughter] yeah yeah most other doctors don't want anyone to know there are there others were allowed to know K\nYeah three beds but you should also asking them questions Kay what kind of work are they doing in the home and then they should ask the questions that are ... to that for example for example if you're doing tile work and you're doing a shower he want to read your bathroom and you're going to have water in there\nWell it's pretty important that you have somebody who knows what they're doing or what kind of training to they have\nWhat kind of background that they have are they\nComing to shows like this and learning about the latest and greatest in building products in technology and attending\nThe seminars now you guys do share our class seminars here that we aren't fit in a classroom and you can learn about a marketing or advertising or business management or estimating but\nThere are also workshops on the exhibit floor like yours that's what we're doing at our hands on training\nAbout how to uh you install the product successfully\nThat's right we're telling all the background about why you would use the product the benefits the futures of it and exactly how to put it in proper\nAnd there were six people nice completely surroundings that are exhibit and of one of them was me yeah and I got to tell you that everybody seemed so fascinated by what was going on\nThey were really paying attention yeah we we do have some really needs to suffer remodel or the efficiencies of it how clean it is for them to to do the work the finished product is as good finished\nProducts that are the hormone I tell you what's going to scare a lot of people tell you what scares a lot of people at first who've been in the industry\nThe new Halloween movie coming a no no not Halloween I'm being serious ... anger is backed by the way oh forty years later he comes back to the countdown okay\nOne of the things that I think scare will scare people are a lot about your product\nIs that it's so easy I think that we're also used to working so\nHard to achieve the given and yeah that's the problem I Can't even break a sweat with your product isn't that something really and I and I'm not and I do not have to wear a mask with your product\nWe had all kinds of installers call us and go okay I did this and I did that fits that guy\nDon't really know what else ... what exactly yeah that one of our guys\nTo your school I mean we were unusual to the extent that we did child in house and um\n[noise] we sent our\nTo the training school went through the shooter training school and uh for many years we successfully insult tile and how we do offer over three hundred trainings\nYear across the U.S and Canada for installers people in the professions\nWhether they're remodeled builders they could be architects specify the product or people that sell their product retail wholesale we train them all so that they know exactly what our products are about and how to put them in properly these are free there is so aerial reason why somebody shouldn't come to our workshop so when a homeowner's asking\nDo you do you use the litter system have you been to one of their work shops because we get them all the training they need and all of a support\nWorse to do with here's what I hear from uh other towel contractors they say oh well you know I don't usually are because it it adds to the cost\nYou know cost they are do to do so dumb it adds to the cost it adds to the material ...\nHistorically what it does is it saves on labor costs because it's so easy to install but they don't like the fact that it adds to the material costs and I know that's not as hell contracts that I Want to work\nWith they have to get over that that is a bit of a you know something to get over there that's for sure yeah All right well listen we appreciate\nThe fact that you folks to pony up and\nHave a presented our remote here from the remodeling show and ... and we want to invite you listening to visit the Andes website is ...

and access are pro podcast or all three hours of our on the\nTalking about an issue that have been each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr pick is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr biggest thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris grades have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress\nOn the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension and your\nMuscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right\nAs a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy now and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over in the muscles in around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive\nDifficulties and I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen health and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night\nAnd how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps in their legs and we're illnesses\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more harassed or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting on life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old\nYeah and your body's actually starting to manifest at wow all due to a simple\nLack of these nutrients\nCalcium and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this into the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down great absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nOr I this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd want to let you know the doctor bank is has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred\nEight two three eight three nine to\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain in stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you it's lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis you want to improve your heart help your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress\nI encourage you tried the ... formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred eight two three eight three nine to\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks this book is packed with vital information about why your calcium needs change with age\n... teams rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression fatigue it's all in this very informative

the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drifts little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah there's a point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr Pickett's you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the

events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles working real relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium may need them in the system well so the very drugs

you\nTurn your great nose into good news for all the people on earth shape us into willing serving up your kingdom and make us desire always and only your will\n\nGreat to be on to you and piece from God our father and our lord and savior Jesus Christ amen confirmation affirmation of faith\nIt is also called today we have for youth who will come from a\nFrom their faith in public confession\nAnd as a part of the works of four have chosen a favorite verse and I commend them for being able to limited to only one 'cause like I Would\nHave failed that assignment to many favorites face\nAs you know as a gift from God Martin Luther talked about that in the explanation to the third article of the apostles ...\nHe says I Believe that I cannot buy my own reason or understanding believe in Jesus Christ or come to him\nThe Holy Spirit calls me through the gospel enlightened me with his gifts sanctify and keeps me in one true face\nIt is the work of the Holy Spirit to create face face is not our work it is God's work in and the definition of faith again\nFor Martin Luther is to fear love and trust God above all else which certainly needs to be God's work in me because otherwise it just ain't gonna happen\nI'm far too likely far too prone to be trusted myself far too often\nBut that's what's going on today that's what's happened to these views are confirming confessing that God's Holy Spirit has been at work\nCreating faith with you and you guys got all that right good\nSo I was wondering you know if if I Would help you to focus on the sermon if I told you there's going to be a quiz\nAt the end of it because there will be\nIf you would follow Jesus which is what that confession of faith is all about that you weren't going to serve\nYou are to count yourself as the lowest one that's the word that market just wanting us to understand\nMost clearly\nMarked chapter ten that's where the gospel for today was red Jesus\nWe know Jerusalem is just around the corner the death in crucifixion of Jesus is going to be happening soon and in chapters eight and nine and ten Jesus has predicted his death\nDesk on the cross three times and the last production was right for\n... billion or read for us this morning\nAnd after that first production deal that's when Jesus there Peter makes that great confession and then\nJesus Says yes when I go into Jerusalem to die in particular no that's not what's gonna happen\nAnd Jesus needs to review can and then after the second production Jesus again says I'm going to Jerusalem are going to die\nThat's when the disciples argue about which one of them is the greatest and then the third production of his crucifixion in Jerusalem James and John come up and they can I add the left he can I add the right seat at your hand when you come in your glory\nIn March gospel to decide who's just don't get it Jesus keeps trying to tell them what the kingdom is going to be like but they don't get it and it's interesting and marks gospel before you get those three passionate predictions\nJesus heels a blind man and at the end of the tree passion predictions Jesus fields a blind\nBut the disciples were just kind of blind throughout until that resurrection\nBecause they're worried about places will power and privilege they're worried about being the most important the most influential they're they're wanting to be the stars of the show they all think that you know what I'm going to be that number one draft choice or maybe I was that's why Jesus chose me to\nCome and follow they don't get it that the kingdom of God is about being a surfing the life of a follower of Jesus is about being a servant\nSo as you make that confession that affirmation of fate today that is what you are saying I Will\nBe a follower of Jesus I Will be a surge\nAnd it's what each of us states each and every week every time we use those words of the powerful creed the nice thing ... to confess our faith\nPart of that confession is I Will be served\nI mean if we\nPeople have got to say no I don't have to serve them those are people that I should be serving and that is just not\nThe way of Jesus because he wrote to serve\nThose who are around us\nYou know those those ancient words of the creed the palm fools are nice scene you know we we speak them from memory they say what we believe and asked me saying what we believe\nAbout the guy who loves us so greatly we also are saying confessing boldly this is who we are we are followers of\nJesus because Jesus loves us enough to die for us believing in God confessing faith in God means that we know we are a part of that most important relationship of all the one between God and those whom God loves and that's why\nThat is you know\n\nAnd that relationship makes us to be who we are below the child of God and it keeps moving us in shaping us so we can live that life\nOf child with God\nWe're call to be\nIt's not just some intellectual exercise it's not just repeating back some words\nThat the church uses old so many times and we've heard in church so often this\nIs saying there is a God who created all things there is Jesus some guy came to die for me and my ... and rose again on the third day there is God's Holy Spirit who fills me and moved me and comfort to me and sustains me\nAll of my days the truth of this confession\nThe power of this confession must and will change your life\nSuch as the power of our God\nSuch as the power of God's love working in each and every one of\nUs Jesus came to serve\nJesus came to die\nTo give his life for the sake of everyone\n[laughter] [noise] this\nTruth this confession is also at the heart of who we are this truth which we confessed each week\nFirst of all it tells me how incredibly valuable\nI Am you are in the eyes of God\nGod's\nOnly son is willing to come and die\nFor you Jesus gives up his life for you child\n\nI Want to thank you for those state it's a faith that are found in the bulletin this

invisible to the body's defenses and the immune system can't kill what can't see it\nDoctors in essence taught as amused system\nSee they took billions of her white blood cells cells that normally are good at destroying invaders like bacteria and viruses but bad at fighting cancer and turn them into camps are killers\nWe can take those cells out of the body genetically modified them teach them how to fight cancer and then infuse them back into the patient\nLike their blood house and you give them the center of the cancer exactly say go\nTraditional therapies like chemo and radiation often
