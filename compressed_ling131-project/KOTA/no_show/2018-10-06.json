cobbler first down\nTheir artificially their eighth I'm sure I've lost track along the way and it's women with a six yard run\nThirty four yard wind of Sioux Falls Roosevelt we'd man with his twenty six carry out of the night\nFive fifty years ago the clock is stopped\nDoes it reset the chains\nAnd he well he was taken out of bounds June clout splits out to the right Roosevelt jumps there back\nTalk so hard now between the numbers and the hash mark on the near side stretches for to fly comes in late\nWeeding and got it inside the thirties or the twenty nine would have been a pick up a five and that penalty will be a whole that gets the cobbler's\nFlags sits at the original line of scrimmage cobbler's who did not have a penalty of the first half have for here in the second half and this one is costly instead of a second and five they're going to be looking at a first and wanting\nPenalty back to the forty four yard wine\nAnd the flight came in late way past the point that we needed that block\nThe cobbler's first and twenty five oh wait to go in the ball game and Rapid City central if you're just joining us leading Sioux Falls Roosevelt Nineteen Eighteen in a totally dominated the second half they trailed Eighteen to six at the house and put up two touchdowns\nIt picked up two turtle overs\nAnd taking the ball over on downs in the three possessions by Roosevelt

I I'm pretty sure there's a woman of Indian ancestry bleeding heavily after a miscarriage the doctor who saw her suspected street induced an abortion and call the police when Patel woke up after ... there was a police officer standing by her bed\nAnd the anti choice Dr ... left the hospital to go in search of the fetus and sure enough they found one\nAnd despite hospital test showing no traces of any aboard a face CNN or blood work the state of Indiana charged her with both feet aside for allegedly inducing an abortion and child and the clock for allegedly having a premature baby\nSo that was that was in you know this\nOriginally happened the same year that Pence was sworn in\nAnd then the next year that was twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen she's arrested in March or this year than this from this piece in salon a pen signed a law prohibiting women from a tiny obtaining abortion because of race\nOr the gender of disability the fetus making any out of the second ... said the nation and do that this has scared the hell out of people of color because\nYou can you can now say to a woman who who is not Caucasian that ah who had a miscarriage that shit actually tried to induce that because she had a child who was a person of color she was trying to induce abortion based on race\nAnd she basically has no defense I mean this is this is what happened to ... Patel\nIn fact a perfect Patel had had numerous text messages where the front of her as a ... is talking about how she was afraid to go to the doctor because you know she didn't know what happened\n[noise] um\nSo anyhow federal judge block this in this law but um this this ... but you know what happened then on march thirtieth was thirty three year old ... hotel was sentenced to Twenty years in prison she'd been facing is there\nA Seventy year sentence\nUnder Mike Pence's laws and Mike Pence's Indiana Seventy years out and they sent and started Twenty years in prison for this miscarriage\nShe originally she was sentenced to actually to Thirty years ten years was suspended and then they had also a six year sentence on the fetus I charge that overlap to that now since then she has she has gotten out that I Believe this is something\nThat's been a reverse effect or at least is on hold but I mean this is this is the world that Brett Kavanaugh would have us live in this world that Mike Pence and now Donald Trump would have us live in\nDonald Trump's we laughed with Howard Stern about how when his second white when while when his second wife was his girlfriend and he got her pregnant I'm Marla Maples he discussed with her whether or not she should have an abortion and she decided she wanted to have the baby and those Tiffany\nSo you know and that that is like right up at the top of the list of the stakes in this debate although everybody's framing it about whether\nClear from Christine Blasey Ford should be believed and obviously you know should be and and whether the FBI shouldn't be doing an investigation into that and yes they should have a guest the White House block them\nBut there are other things on the docket [noise]\nI mean you know we're looking at the end of roe v wait how among other things where we're looking at the end of possibly Medicare\nAnd Social Security and the environmental protection agency if Kavanaugh believes that they're all unconstitutional this is Tom are\nMove program because the federalist society in general a or at least the people associated with a generally take that position that these things are unconstitutional and now there will be five federal society people on the court\n[noise]\n\nDo you feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nOr the actual executives are cashing out the FCC verified corporate buybacks are hiding insider trading and Justin's casinos aren't built on winters and neither is the stock market\nIt's called the wealth transfer and you and I are the ones that Red Sox are high was a high downside gold is low with a high upside right now gold and silver are bargains ever the strategy by low sell high\nIf you want to make insider moves and hedge against the volatile market call my friends that I T I'm trading and find out why smart money is cashing out of high risk stocks for the safest currency ever created\nSpeak to an idea I'm precious metals expert and learn the smart money strategies and gold and silver\nAds for their free investment guide which outlines how you can use precious metals as your ultimate safe haven asset call one AAA owned goal that's one triple A.

Democrats\nThey shouldn't that waste any time we're trying to go after the Republicans tried to save do everything you can to save our voting rights because that no matter what you do that is a thing would we've had elections stolen from us and everything get rid of their Citizens United\nTheir their counties that these ballot images exist so it seems like a threat oh my God you're trying to make us trans parent you can't use citizens shut up go away no we're going to count the vote and us down and said to count the votes so I guess the F ... inside\nYeah so we have we have two two issues here one is the millions of people who are being ill legitimately incorrectly inaccurately or perhaps accurate because they were targeted because they were young old or or a or a minority racial minority\nUh who are being thrown off of voting rolls all across the United states in an effort that has been championed by Donald Trump and Kris Kobach and then at the same time we've got it even if you're going to end up voting if they if you ... if your name Adam and emerged from the voting laws you may well be voted out of machine that could be doing anything to your vote\nAnything to your vote and that's the trouble with on transparent digital counting um and fracking counting as we know we've done forever and magic and talked about how some detectable but on the ballot images are a means of audit and interestingly Tom because the health America vote act\nHad some language about well it has to be ought to double in case you know challenge so ballot images were sort of included and talked about by the vendors as well we have a picture of every ballot we scam so you could look at those and now they're hiding them ...\nAlso I Want to caution people the Republicans are trying to go oh ballot images great now that you want those let's make those the only audit mechanism let's never go to paper ballots and that's not cool because you could duplicate messed with ballot images digitally and if you never connected them to their papers stores\nBy some sort of percentage less connect and seeing all these ballot images are really from their stores\nThat would be a percentage bought it for ... uh do both you can't just do it by device forever\nAnd I just went ... and then the ... and then the third issue is uh to you know how vulnerable are our election systems and this would include are voting registration rolls\nTo hacking and we know that or at least according to the FBI that the Russians have hacked into the into the voting systems and the uh the registration rolls of of you know ... states now and yet to enter and according to Trump the Chinese have done the same thing\nAnd yup there's some evidence that other countries as well have a Iran's specifically of penetrated and North Korea penetrated our voting systems um yeah so so what's being done about all these things made me kind of\nA well to federal legislation sales because really our elected officials are scared to tell election offices what to do our elected officials\nSo here's my solution or and what I'm trying to message we each of us voters we have to protect their own felt so here's what I'm telling people to do go to your secretary of state sector registration\nIn your registration check if you're not if it's not right if anything's wrong or if you're not there call the number there or go down to your office and makes you register don't depend on somebody canvassing you got to go down to the office\nAnd want to do it online soon because later they're going to go oh you weren't on the rules 'cause you registered to late we were ...\nNumber two if your registration shows that your vote by mail voter\nMake sure that you get that vote by mail\nBallot and either voted and send it in early so it's an election night returns because anything coming into near to the election I won't be processed and will be an election night returns\nYou need to both about or if you prefer to go to the polls you got to bring that ballot in and surrender it on voted or they won't give you a ballot because they'll assume you used it and you're voting twice\nDaniel vote provisional don't get in the provisional batch it's banned in every state right and you need to be in the regular ballot that she got a check your registration no your vote by mail status\nTake care of either getting the damn ballot no I don't know I didn't get it and I want to vote now do we ... we're going to vote for visual you gotta make sure that you tell the office I haven't got my ballot and I want it\nYou also need to screen shot of your registration and maybe print it out and take it to the polls because they might tell you well you're not here and you can say yeah well I was here this is not my fault somebody's gotten into your vote are all\nThese ways of protecting ourselves can either actually protect us and got us regular voted the polls certainly obeying all the rules will do that if you encouraged\nThese methods will start to create a lot of people who did this and going so it was really wrong and then we have more evidence so that we don't hear just no evidence that only happened to you and people feel ashamed that walk away going wow that's made the both traditional I don't know why\nWell here's why they might be gaming you so stay out of the game and take a screen shouted at registration and know you were on the rolls and if you're not on the roads register now\nIt's a I think there's still a window of opportunity in most states don't wait because they will say all these young people didn't on they registered late in the back locked and we don't have them on the rolls bridges provisional though that school it's not cool so protect yourself we have to protect ourselves now it's down to that there\nYou go maybe Kennedy uh with progressive Democrats who America PT America dot org and ah just always this extraordinary work that you've been doing for years and years on this on this issue of\nUh you know voter integrity thank you\nThank you very much Tom\nScreaming talking with is always great how wonderful thank you ...\n... ... back to pick it up your phone calls here Mike in la Mesa, California listening KPFK Microsoft\nThey told him I just wanted to recruiter aquarium or apparently made by a car yesterday\nFor the Episcopal Church or some sort of reaction or a cabal just because Judge Gorsuch and presumably Mike Pence are members okay yeah I'm In the first place my parents as far as I can determine one straight promoted very devout Roman

gender does not determine and antisocial behavior and my conclusion is\nBe afraid to physical truth if you are indeed a partner and protect a and not have credit to the truth of the biological basis of behavior can only help you okay\nVery good of you you make a compelling argument a I Believe um and probably one that deserves more than four minutes on the radio [laughter] and and so you know we'll have to circle back to it at some point in the future but thank you thank you for raising that I'm Mark in San Diego California a mark what's up\n[noise] a child I got on your show wondering why we get in these situations where uh on August or candidate Kavanaugh's being shut down our throw it against\nTheir will or a unpopular because the Koch brothers want him\nWell it's I think it's more a structural than that I think it's because the United states government\nIs the way it's set up is not of course that the majority of the equal upstart where the U.S Senate sure or do you have two senators from California represented almost forty million people\nYet not caught up with less than a million people gets through senator all the ordinary people gets two senators that's why you have like Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell\nAlways happy that in a way against the people these guys keep getting reelected and they and they send you already and you've got a Congress what you're supposed to be more representative Yeah Yup it's gerrymandered so much that it does not and then you've got to the White House who lost three million votes\nSo that there is the United states government or that's why we get ... and policies shut down our throats constantly that much of the country a lot\nYeah and most of the things that you've described originate in the debate over slavery they they are parts of the compromise and there were a series of them to Connecticut Compromise is probably the most famous one um\nThat that basically wanted to keep now they're in the textbooks you know for a particularly the ones that you read in the northern schools it thought it was always about Delaware Rhode Island the small states but in fact the population of Georgia was about the same as as one of those states I I forget which one at the time of the of the\nOf the writing of the constitution the white population in Georgia but the you know the black population Georgia was substantial and and so really the two senators per state\nAnd we you know was was based on on giving the slave states extra power as well as the small states up north\nAnd that you know that needs to be stripped out of the constitution or we need to come to a better understanding of that number one\nAnd the number two the electoral college was you know there for the exact same reason to give the small states slave states you know a large say so you know yeah spot on mark thanks for the call Tony in Huntsville, Alabama a Tony what's up\nHey Tom how're you doing today good\nGood uh listen man a I call the talk about Joe Manchin is that his name's ...\nAh I don't\nAgree with the caller before me Joe Manchin is not a Democrat if you're a Democrat you believe and the Democrats\nYou believe that they're going to ... they're going to stand by you that they're going to fight for you get out knock on doors for you and then you get up there and use use state would stand with the Republican on the biggest issue of our time\nTo to to to overturn everything that to a gym there Democrats and the progressive have fought for because you're afraid they won't stand with you in a Republican state would then you shouldn't have your seat either use and with those people or you don't\nAnd that was my point is is the electorate knows that and and I just I I think the age\nOr I'm frankly on both sides you know the Republican side if you're not a full blown racist anti Semite white supremacy person they're Republican Party doesn't why anymore and on the manic side if you're not actually\nVan Dyke for

international justice in the same breath as you know these campaigners for sexual violence or being praised by the Nobel Committee\nAmerican actions in the war in Iraq are being condemned it was\nPersonally carry all that I Am\nMostly on the tip of the cabinet but but\nYeah I'm calling a story of men in the prison in Iraq being raped with the times is that what she was talking about or

[noise]\nWell you said multiple or not [noise]\nI think you should under yeah maybe your candidate to do that Dr tape is going to explain that will take a call in a moment from Lansdale, Pennsylvania not dictate what would be the circumstances under which somebody would take a multiple vitamin and mineral\nOdd I think a better question is what would be the circumstances under which somebody wouldn't take one it's just some simple health insurance I think you can think of it as that way in terms of bridging the gap\nBetween our daily diet and making sure that we have optimal level of those individual nutrients in the vitamins and minerals and in in the most current\nA sophisticated multi vitamins you're getting a lot more than that you know a whole food for example fight a new trends come from ... the\nPlant these compounds that you know art vitamins and minerals per se but we have a you know they have health benefits for us and so it really can make a difference those those micro nutrients to be getting them in every day\nAnd uh [noise]\nNow does it make a difference in terms of delivery system powder\nPill liquid what do you think\nThe formula itself and the individual components of the formula generally\n... ... a\nA whole earth and see so\n\nWhat else can what else can I ask ... um I take the man who were the\nGood or give it to me it would grab a\nPerson taking it will notice that they look on the back of the they look at the ... panel they're going to see that if they were accustomed to taking a tradition or another kind of multi they're going to say gee these are small doses what would you say about that\nThat we're talking about in many cases forms of nutrients that you are not finding and the standard multi for example when it comes to the bees\nMost of the bees in here are in activated form so normally when we have a B. vitamins either in our diet or standard supplement the liver has to convert it through you know one or more steps to its active form that you then actually utilizing the body but\nIn these multi use those that conversion has been made using enzymes in the laboratory and those active forms have been put into the supplements so there's an example of an area where you don't need as high amounts you're utilizing more of the new trend that's in their\n... organic a hundred percent organic yes\nAnd uh what else would you say about multiple why them in the minerals from a natural factors what else would you want to\nSay well one of the features that I Love about these is that they're one of the few very few vitamin supplements multi is on the market that\nContain vitamin K too and this will eventually be standard but again the whole earth and the line is is leading the charge and really ahead of the pack in terms of including this particular new trend that's been overlooked and of course it's a it's an area of of particular interest for me and that's what my book is about\nAnd this is a new trend that is helpful for bone health for heart health for cancer\nProstate cancer bitterness of prostate health for men and many other aspects of helping again we often don't see this in a multivitamin\nSo you looted your book with the title of the book\nK to end the calcium paradox how little known vitamin could save your life once you talk a little bit more bug but that's interesting\nWell I don't think he too is a new trend that will take calcium wherever it is on the body and help guide it into your bones\nAnd teeth where you watch it and keep it out of areas where you don't watch it like your arteries for example is including heel spurs kidney stones in other areas where calcium can build up\nThat it shouldn't be and so and if it does many other things interesting and important things for health but that's a ... he won so\nAnybody who is taking vitamin D we're the vitamin D will help you absorb more calcium but once the calcium absorb vitamin D has no control over where it goes and so that's the role of vitamin K choose to take that calcium and direct it to the right places\n...\nGeorge K Ron blue is my guest a and you can call\nYou eat some seven eight nine seven five eight seven seven eight nine seven talk\nSo I'm\nTaking you take the multiple with food or not\nYes with food why that is one our body is primed to be absorbing nutrients of all kinds and so you will better absorb the nutrients from your multi as you are absorbing the nutrients from the food that you're eating\n\nSo I'm also with these multiple\nYou take them in the morning you take 'em in the afternoon ... or ... when do you take them\nTo do here is one tablet twice daily and so it is better to spread it out whenever it's convenient once a breakfast once it dinner that works well for most people or\nAnything else you want any other argument you want to make about multiple vitamins and minerals supplement\nOr what I could go on and on about it I think that we really appreciate actually the minerals because minerals\nAre um can be challenging to get from our diet and because we know that ... come from the soil and win soils are depleted as they're becoming depleted and minerals than those are going to be lacking from the foods that were eating and\nSo eating organic is important because soil typically tends to be healthier and rich in minerals but another way to get those minerals back into our body is with a multi vitamins and minerals supplements\nIt's seven\nEight nine seven eight to five five eight seven seven eight nine seven talk

really glad you asked that because this is\nIt [noise] is it something of a of a myth although yes you can lower your your intake of vitamin K by avoiding green leafy vegetables that really only makes a difference for people who are artificially deficient in vitamin K when they're taking forefront\nOrdinarily even if you very strictly avoid green leafy if\nYou will get small amounts of vitamin K n

I. M. and traveled intermediate part of the elements\nNow this case is unique because that's the usual area for essential tremor when we did that surgery on that area\nHe got you know pretty good from our control but it wasn't perfect\nAnd the interesting aspect that's also Ken Burns picked up on is that we have to then addict secondly that is not so unusual so we needed to find that\nAnd he okayed it in the movie that that was great\nWell I mean you know let me be clear a good old brain surgery\nOr have seen that are in risk and I of course have to discuss all of this with Mr fresh and all of my patients that it has such as causing all bleed hemorrhage stroke and so forth so we have to take those risks\nBut in this case the potential benefits far outweigh in our opinion\nThe risks that he talks for his quality of life it was a deal breaker yes absolutely you know the amount of a trauma that Mr ... chats actually would be considered you know not so much in in the sense that you and I like if we had it it would not affect our life\nBut for him because he's a hunter master that's what's actually devastating\nAnd now the other interesting thing is he has a remote Chanel where he can turn these electrodes on or off if he's not using up playing the violin right\nThat is correct so he can and and that soon as he turns it off all up and comer comes back with ... yeah he demonstrates in the movie now the other interesting thing is when we added a second lead in another area just in front of the the I Am\nWhat we discovered is his criminal control actually [laughter] it's almost to press the larger meaning that you know everybody you and I answered conditions would have a little bit of tremor\nFor the logic tremor well interestingly she can now hold on no almost\nSuperhuman meaning that he can place had violent [noise] even better than before but [laughter] it's wonderful [laughter] All right we've\nBeen talking about the deep brain stimulation without your tend to lead

dot com promo college radio that to blink half dot com prominent code radio\nYou know the feeling that not materialized losing your stomach\nThat is emerging to be very powerful\nIn addition that it's also allowing us some interesting understanding of how religion or control of movement happened that what that means is how does the brain control our lemons voluntarily so this is a finding that was just reported in nature medicine\nYes that that that's correct so maybe I can tell you a little bit of background on this so\nAbout four years ago that the ... accurate ten and act which was the ... had 'em published a paper very interesting paper\nWhere they implanted patients at that time about four patients where ... simulation below the level of the spinal cord injury caused voluntary movement back in the lower extremities\nEpidural means above\nSoda sold ... around the spinal that's correct\nYeah so that's a technology that is essentially the same as what we use for our pain patients under the skin but outside of the spinal cord\nOutside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spy okay okay so these are actually surgical implants and what's been demonstrated with these devices and pain patients\nIs that they can help with pain so this is already approved by the FDA for pain now what Dr ... and ... group that was too now apply this technology and spinal cord injured patients who've been paralyzed for example with a thoracic were\nUm child has level complete motor insurance rate meaning they can't move their legs or sense there's no sensation\nSo when that paper came out that you can get movement we were very excited about it because that's really changes our whole view of what we can do for our spinal cord injury patients\nSo we can talk with Dr ... group and decided tend to replicate those studies and so initially\nThe latest update on this research was recently published in nature medicine we've heard about this exciting advancement from the nearest surgeons perspective but an equally important part as a role play by physical medicine and rehabilitation\nAnd here to tell us about it is Dr Christians out and making guilt doctors always the director of Mayo clinic's assistive and restored of technology laboratory\nAnd Meghan is a physical therapist and doctors all lab welcome both of you to the program\nFor having us You're good to have you both bits must be exciting for both of you to to work on this project who's most excited\n[laughter] I like Meghan\nYeah and you know being a clinician and having that experience and working at the population for\nFourteen Fifteen Years now it's really time to be able to finally have something that we can talk to patients are patients families that we're making progress towards\nUm recovery for those who have such a devastating injury that didn't complete spinal cord injury so it's it's really life changing for me it's a professional but also the experience to be able to tell her patients coke on the horizon it's really really amazing\nDid you know for a while but this was coming something like this would ultimately become available\nYou know I had been kind of following the literature um that had been coming out from a UCLA our collaborators from UCLA as well and the University of Toledo so I was aware of this type of intervention and what it was available to the individuals and spinal cord injuries and what their options were\nWhich were really promising but I think that the paper and in our our adult really kind of her home run compared to where it started and so you know we knew there was a possibility but what would the level of ability and what was the level of recovery\nWas really beyond my belief at that point so it's really amazing to see the progress we've made to this point anything to add doctors out\nI guess I Would like to just add that I mean I think it's exciting that that we at Mayo get to have a team that that is able to replicate this work and push it forward and and now really excited because we have this great team together and the possibilities are sort of endless now for what for what we can do next so\nWhat role to group therapy play and rehabilitation play in this whole process and how important is that we know about the employer we know about the same illusion um but didn't that they should also have a significant amount of therapy book for the employer was ever answered\nYes on the part of the trial is for the first five to six months we did typical therapy alone and worked on the type of activities that were attachments addicted standing and stepping in balance training which is why we continued with that after the surgery\nBut we really wanted to do the physical therapy and can lead to find out what kind of recovery as possible and just for therapy alone\nUm the individual that um where we've published in the in the paper had very little physical therapy after the injury\nI'm three years prior other than the traditional conventional compensatory strategies um so it wasn't to the level and what we introduced in the rehab program at this trial so he did five to six months of intense therapy with you know maybe ... minor improvements in terms of his endurance and conditioning but no recovery below the level of injury\nSo how do you what sort of political therapy do you do on someone whose legs were\nParalyzed so our goal was to regain blitz in all activation and movement which means to be able to intently move their legs or activate their muscles okay\nSo you were trying to get him to be able to move something that wouldn't vote their credit which you can\nAnd we were we using strategies that we use with other individuals with neurologic conditions um to try to engage the than aroma killer um activity of the legs and the trunk\nBy loading them and by going to the repetition of the Fox and extension moments of the legs so it's a standard of care that we typically follow for people who have had some motor and century activation but it's not the standard of care for people who had a complete proud to injury such as these individuals\nWho you were trying to strengthen the muscles that you knew the patient would need to walk\n[noise] partially yet\nI remind you that one in a spinal cord injury\nThere is no damage to the muscle the damages and the spinal cord but the age where they are trophies atrophy definitely so our our purpose with tried to ... century information up through the nervous system by loading the legs and providing tactile cute and movements of the life that can be sent up through the central nervous system then try to make\nThe connection and a nurse you didn't send a motor output in the muscles\nSo does this type of therapy continue indefinitely for the patient\nSo we quickly realized that you know you can't have an epidural electrical stimulation without physical therapy we feel they're both in are going to that type of recovery so we know it's really important\nTo you but you can put the employer it in but that it won't do any good if you don't have the therapy\nWe better in theory an had yet to be proven as well but um we know physical therapy itself wasn't cancer so we had the implant and we added that therapy and the teenage together and we got these miraculous result\nUm what goes on from here a little tricky because number one like I said that's not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send the individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage to train the leader\nIn conjunction with a therapy which we feel really really valuable so we're at that point with the trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program and identifying activities have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with minimal assistive devices and then let them do that stuff at home on their own\nUm and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is it's appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to implement into standard of care\nSo how many patients who have had the day we later now order are presently going through the therapy and ... what are the things that they're actually able to do that they couldn't do before\nSo we're on our second subject right now are patients so even wrote to 'em we have some research funding to hopefully continue into a new protocol that will be very similar but will allow us to enroll additional subject\nI'm right now the subject I'm the first subject is able to um\nYou know stand alone for a long period of time he's able to um in wheelchair bound before yeah um he's able to walk 'em or independently step on a treadmill and also over ground with a Walker\nSo he had some assistance obviously to help him you know their weight on his legs but he's able to um\nAs Meghan describe volition only move his legs when he wants so on command so that's really the exciting part is is where ... where we can go from here now improved bladder and ball function for him we've had some anecdotal\nImprovements although um we didn't measure those things directly so I'm at this point um our next study we're going to do more um data collections which we hope will help inform whether there's actual return of of bowing bladder um but they do report I'm kind of a shorter\nBell on time so that's a good thing\nAnd we just don't have evidence that you're working with a second patient is it's very similar to what the first space you want or are known to patients the same [laughter] you know to me is\nHow do we go from one or two individuals to millions because we know they're somewhere between five and six million people out there who have spinal cord injuries maybe not complete but partial ... how do we were we go from here how can we get this technology moves to marry for\nFive hundred million [laughter] so I think Megan alluded to this earlier and we've probably both looted too you know one thing we need is obviously\nTo gain additional research support money to do this work and to keep this team moving forward I think one of the other critical questions is you know which patients will respond to this therapy and which ones will not so can we come up with a way\nSaying you know out of the millions of patience you know the these people will respond in these won't so that we don't try to deliver a therapy that's not going to be a successful\nFinally do you believe that some day paralysis won't be permanent for all patients\nWell we're definitely making a term because we used to just talk about how do we compensate for the death protests that are existing for the population and now we're talking about how do we recover and how do we make narrow potency occur in the central nervous system so\nWe're definitely making a change in the progress of how we're managing and getting spinal cord injury but that's not a lot of work to be done\nFor you made so much progress old show bar\nAnd into the site in technology and both of such great work and we wish you the bird but thank you [noise]\nWe've been talking about a quarter stimulation the role of rehabilitation without the Christians out from the Mayo Clinic to assist everyone restores new technology laboratory the oppressive [laughter] and they are political therapists leg and Bill thanks so much during whether\nWere going to take a short break and when we come back we'll learn about the many jobs being done by Mayo Clinic volunteers [noise] you're listening to Mayo political radio and

crossing and then the Methodist campus gift shop so\nUm and a lot of people don't know that our proceeds go back to the practice so the ... the good Samaritan fund and then we also find a lot of institutional requests um for example an area needed I pads to better communicate with tricky asked me patience and we funded that a initiative so\nWe try to give back to the organization any of the profits week so if you shop there you're really helping our patient\nAs I mentioned uh this program it's hurting over two hundred stations around the country so let's say that someone is far away from Rochester, Minnesota right now but likes to help out likes to volunteer in their community and is maybe getting an idea of some way they can help out at their local clinic or community\nWell if they want to reach out to me I'm more than happy to share what our model looks like I Would suggest reaching out to hospital patient experience as a first step of getting into the door and its Android with

I don't know I\nDon't know who I don't know I I Am plus the categories never repeated so [laughter] I feel a once is enough okay I guess I've retired the category they got like ... [laughter] so\nLet's start our conversation you've got a brand new book out accents regional war the subtitle is fascinating the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military were going to get into that I Want to get into climate science\nBut I also just when it starts with some basic construct for my audience ... about what you do what\nThe universe has told us what we've learned about it in the last ten to Twenty years let's start there you wrote a book about\nHow much time did you leave for the show [laughter] forty five minute ... yeah I Know how to ... you you watch wrote a book or astrophysics for people in a hurry or something yeah yeah that's precisely the title okay so I'm In a much smaller book than this one right I'm In a hurry to tell me some things that are really cool but I should know oh yeah\nSo in Africa there's people in a hurry or it it's a curated\nSet of information that is intended to just blow your mind every few pages that that was my goal right and I didn't follow it syllabus I'd say well here's the complete lesson plan I just cherry picked\nJust to get you excited so now if you're excited you'll go out and get a bigger book round the universe right now that I think should be for any subject that really being Suzie has them has to\nProceed the investment of time and energy\nThat it might require to get the full understanding so ah okay how about this uh in the centers of stars that have very high mass higher mass than the sun I not only undergoes thermonuclear fusion\nTurning hydrogen and helium they'll keep going down the periodic table of elements how does the healing the carbon nitrogen silicon they'll keep doing this all the way down to iron\nAt the end of their life then they go unstable and explode their guts into the galaxy\nThese are the ingredients that comprise planets when they form rocks have silicon and oxygen these are ingredients manufactured in the centers of SARS so when they explode scattering this enrichment across the galaxy it enables the next generation of stars\nWho have planets another interesting chemical things on them one of his life\nSo the very chemical makeup of life on earth of our bodies is traceable to the actions of stars that have exploded billions of years ago so it's not simply that we live in the universe and you look up and it's there and we're here no it's deeper than that\nWe live in the universe and the universe in a way lives within us\nThat for me is one of the most profound facts that modern astrophysics has given a civilization in our understanding of our place in the universe\nAnd that's not just the scientific construct it sounds almost to me like a philosophical construct like with these things are inter related\nYes well your place in the universe is not just a matter of information it's a matter of for some people it's even spiritual ... it's how do you find yourself it's emotional yeah we are what isn't what what\nIs your meaning the meaning of your existence in this world and so many people spend so long in search of that right and the more you find out that you're connected to the universe here here's a better way to think about it when he offered we we want to think of ourselves as being special for how ...\nWe care about in modern civilization that we think of as modern civilization is today enabled magnified or distributed or contributed to buy space assets\nAnd in a way that is I mean beautifully invisible to us we just go on and you get you withdraw money from the ATM you you just do these things and not even thinking about it and so\nSo [laughter] there's the old saying ... probably apocryphal the person who doesn't want to invest in space or because they just want to stay on earth which I don't need space investments\nI don't need space I've got my cell phone and that's all I Need that's all I Know [laughter] how do they exist without the assets in space and talk about ... what ... what does that mean maybe space needs a marketing campaign well I I don't know but if people think they don't need it when in fact their life depends on it\nThere's a mismatch there what's an asset in space you don't use that phrase well so a space asset would be\nLet's start with a GPS satellites watched by the air force\nCo opted by the rest of us and GPS stands for global positioning system got ya I I don't think the lesson for satellite I think that's a system got an I ... definitely the GPS global positioning right and it is a system satellites that\nProvides for coordinates for you you would want you to your attitude your altitude and your time\nThis is very important oh by the way a completely obscure fact the GPS satellites are so high up that they're in a significantly different gravitational field of earth than we are\nAn ... general theory of relativity prescribes\nThat if you're in a lower gravitational field time we'll take more\nFaster for you that it will if you're in a higher gravitational field so the time kept by GPS satellite has to be corrected for general theory of relativity before it sends the signals back down to us and we know precisely how much correction that is a really obscure fact but I had to throw a fantastic yes and\nAnd how was that program how do we know what that differential is oh 'cause you can calculate what the strength of the gravity is at they're orbiting out that you've got a safe that's and then you engineer back you'd have to medically reverse engineer that to what time difference it would take because time is not absolute it's relative\nAccording to [laughter] as someone who works in the business that has built at least conceptually around precise timing I Know it's also precise but also incredibly relatives relative\nIs it's not it's not going to be that\nIt can't be that unless if it is it's the end of everything and space to something called the Kessler effect again I'd go for it to catch what Nineteen Seventy eight calculated they'd be have enough satellites above a certain threshold and you destroy one of them\nAre not density of satellites and your destroy one of them let's make the math easy but the breaking into ten pieces right if those Tempe just each had a satellite\nAnd breaks those into ten pieces each you'll take out one ten one hundred one thousand satellites in just a few orbits and it stabilizes and destroys every single satellite that's up there and that was the scenario portrayed in the movie gravity\nIt was yes so that is something that we can prevent or we can to prevent\nIt says that if you want to watch stuff up in space it's the end of all your space assets even if you're targeting your enemy so space as far as I can project for it will always be sort of one of reconnaissance\nThe militarization of space has been around since the sixties if you include the constant in your concept of militarization the role of intelligence gathering\nSpy satellites ever since we've had satellites that's not a new thing I that is the militarization of space 'cause it enables command and control decisions on earth that are much higher precision and accuracy\nThis is a great way to get to well we'll start with a probably a conceptual conversation about space for something more specific one because that leads into your book accessory to war space for ... minutes later when he was here said\nIt sounds brand new it sounds like something we've never considered before he talk this through how in Congress it had been discussed in under a different name and under a different construct tell me your evaluation of the space for as a concept and as a either achievable or should not be achievable goal for the United states\nI remember recommending a space force in two thousand and one twelve member commission to which I had been appointed by George W. Bush\nTo serve as a ... to to explore why the u._s. aerospace industry was on hard times it was a commission specifically task to understanding\nWhat would happen if we let the aerospace industry just go the way it was headed\nIt would be able to going out of business sale\nAt that time the Cold War was over the weekend competition from Airbus embrace air other sort of aviation I'm a giants in the world so what what's going on because if we lose our aerospace industry then we lose our control over our own we lose our own um\nAh ah what's the word but your own destiny does it work without forgetting of losing in at the moment um you can lose your you lose your own access to your transportation right to your security and to your commerce okay so\nI'm In there I remember saying well why don't we separate out the space force from the air force these are two different regimes of our ... of of of of military interest\nOne involves flying in a vacuum that you know everything is different and people said well we got this the air force guy said we got this because there's us space command\nUnder the air force I okay I'm not going to proceed you OK I'm OK I don't have a horse in this race like All right at your bureaucracy exactly zero [laughter] so but if you want to create a space worst\nMost of it is sort of an accounting shift\nAll of the space activities that we have conducted since the sixties had been under the umbrella of the air force you just pull it out and now to space worst I'd want to throw in some extra things and that's what I like I like protected from rogue asteroids marijuana\nI call that defense that's a good one because that protect us from going extinct ... how about that okay and one would think a high priority I Would think\nThen they didn't have that same pressure of longevity risk because all engines for the most part pretty much say that they're going to continue to pay you for as long as you live right\nRight I guess similarly you would also say then things like market risk an interest rate risk and default risk and things that are associated with stocks and bonds and stuff like that wouldn't also weren't\nRight ... and then you go on to the ... what we refer to as a rover to generate some\nMore sleep between Nineteen twenty two and Nineteen forty five forty four and this was obviously the world war two generation born during that time leading up to and including the second World War and\nMost of these people are tired\nDuring the eighties and nineties Nineteen eighties or Nineteen nineties to be specific and\nThey weren't dealing with the most of them ... ... [noise] I'd say as many of sixty Seventy percent of that generation sellouts pensions from employers where they had worked and they also had a pretty nice stock markets are request\nBack [laughter] okay [laughter] you you can talk a little bit more about that\nYeah and and for those of you that are just joining us we're spending some time this morning really just talking about some different generations in the difference that makes in terms of how they had to approach retirement in thinking about World War two generation\nYou know one of the benefits that they had was centrally a very strong stock market\nFor somebody who was born in what are we talking about here I guess the thirties and forties or so yeah let's say that they were retiring in their sixties and it was really during the eighties and nineties that they were in the core of their retirement\nNow a lot of the times if you think about the stock market history\nYou know one of the question do we have to ask yourself as you know over the long run what do you expect to get out of the stock market and we got to remember I guess that's an important distinction also\nThat for a lot of that previous generation that was born during the you know Nineteen hundred in Nineteen twenty period\nA lot of their investments may not have been stock market base they'll try um they were probably young children going through the great depression and I wonder from a psychological standpoint if that made a difference in how they say even in and how they viewed investments\nAnd sure I mean if history serves me correctly you had more bombs and there was one way that you could invest your money I Would have\nIndividual corporate bonds as corporate America or continue to grow and you know a lot of things that you know your bank would have been involved than there are lots of visits to the bank for dividend in interest ... some things such as that back\nThings that sound very funny nowadays because a lot of us don't have to walk into a bank at all anymore [laughter] All right\nI'm laughing because you're making me think of you know we often talk about coupon bond and found that I actually I used to have the coupons [laughter] he would actually send them to get your interest payment Ryan um and while we still have that it's all electronic these days\nExactly well and another thing now that you said that about the bombs to another thing that the world war two generation had\nWhen they were tiring and the eighties and nineties was certificates of deposits which are bombs and\nThings that would pay them ... percent interest um they would buy it I'm On a ladder dying was what it was called or they wouldn't buy them to expire one year and I'm not actually to expire the following year and so on but they were able to get five percent interest off of the bank notes\nTo help fund their retirement him at least for the last ten years that's absolutely impossible you really get about two percent so to get to restructure the way that you have to find your retirement\nYeah I feel like that's an interesting dichotomy in terms of just the mental shift of what you consider to be an investment in based on\nYou know if you think about it we oftentimes packed and so you know everybody has the same situation that\nSame economic environment and that these rules of thumb that we live by are are just hard and fast rules of thumb and we oftentimes miss\nThe historical or contextual element\nThat makes something seem true we think it's a rule when in reality it's more so just what was true during that time period and then we started out talking about and and again I don't know what the generation is called but it's the generation born from like Nineteen hundred a Nineteen twenty or the generation right before the uh\nThe world war two generation and then we talked a little bit of World War two generation we were kind of breaking apart the different pieces that these two different generations had any kind of the mindset that they had also\nYou know when we were talking about the generation that proceeded to World War two generation\nOne of the main things were really highlighting is that for the most part these were people that were retiring in the fifties and sixties and predominantly have probably pretty strong pension plans that they were relying on\nIn that one of the main differences between people in that generation the baby boomer generation was that the baby boomer generation are much more so than the generation that preceded it for probably much more heavily reliant on stock market returns in a stock market portfolio\nAnd their situation and and a lot of this really has to do with the history of how these different pieces you've also will throw in a few more historical pieces that kind of extrapolate on them you know one of the things we know is that call it in the Nineteen sixties or so\nThat were very heavily stock market based in that they were really probably retiring in the eighties and nineties and the stock market that they had just seem to be so different than maybe the stock market from the preceding generation crime\nAnd then you go into baby boomers who are retiring today and I'm very few of them have pensions and they and they are now most of them are\nHeavily invested in the stock market and as we know or at least since January first of this year you stand out stock market is going up and going down and going up and going down to Madison volatility is the name of the game at least not far I'm twenty eight team\nAnd I think a lot of baby boomers are starting to get a little bit nervous because if they're getting closer retirement or thinking of all do I stay on the market and try it out of the market and that's the same type of issue that they will face throughout retirement\nIf there and feel invested in it is oh my gosh what do I do ... I don't know what's gonna happen next\nYeah it's kind of interesting how this happened because then it since\nIt was the baby boomer generation that kind of created both the six in the issues that we're facing now in in what we mean by that is\nWhile I don't think you can tell the story of the stock market purely from social demographic wave and stuff like that I think they do play some factor in the so you think about the eighties and nineties in what made that stock market so good well there's a number of things you could say that part of it\nWas you know the advent of higher rates were when cage and stuff like that coupled with the creation of mutual funds and exchange traded funds and the ability for people to really just pour money into the stock market\nBut I think the other piece of that is that it just happened to coincide with when the baby boomer population within their peak spending years uh-huh so you know they were buying bigger houses they were sending kids to college they were buying new cars and all these goods and services and it was really\nThe spending that they had during those periods coupled with these other pieces and the advent of the Internet in these other pieces that were being opened up it created almost quote unquote like a perfect storm that allow the world war two generation to have this historically\nHigh stock market that coincided with when they were really trying to draw out of the market so it was almost good timing for the world war two generations\nAnd it was and and I think baby boomers as well are the longevity issue is becoming such a big question mark for them because their parents' generation World War two generation as\nThere's been such a durable generation I mean many of them are still alive and well into their nineties at an early hundred so now baby boomers who are sixty five or seven years old going well wait a minute how long do I need to find this retirement for I mean I may be around for\nThirty or thirty five years and retire bugs and and that goes back to a young shaping how much of the portfolio kind of ...\nYeah I think that that's so true because\nInstead of you know thinking back to what we're talking about with the earlier generation where we said you know they were still probably retiring in their fifties or so but life expectancy was you know in the sixties you know managing a ten to Fifteen year income distribution is very different than managing it thirty plus your income distribution from a portfolio\nCertainly on\nOne of the other things that we then if we kind of take the story a little bit further is the question of well why is the market today seem so different than the market in the eighties and nineties and again it kinda went back to the baby board you know if if a lot of the growth in the eighties and nineties was because the baby boomers were in their peak spending years\nThen we have to ask ourselves well what is the baby boomer generation doing currently most of them are not in their peak spending years anymore they're gearing up for retirement or in retirement\nIt's a question that a lot of economists are paying a lot of attention to is that\nAs people had into retirement and you got the baby boom generation owes Seventy five million clause that they're actually much more careful of their spending habits Sam is what kind of affects us that climate have on the overall economy\nThen we'll talk a little bit about the millennial generation\nWhich is actually a larger generation on the baby boomers Seventy eight million plus in millennials\nAnd they're not quite in their peak spending years yeah so how all of this is going to shake our them and the strain on the Social Security benefits that the baby boomers will put it on to it and Medicare benefits\nAnd potential changes them both of those benefits that could come about just becoming a very complex retirement\nYet to say the least for those that you're just joining us this is Sam ... cook and we're talking about just some of the differences that different generations have had the feet from retirement planning standpoint but I think that's a really good point you know if you think back to the future previous generations from a security standpoint for example\nThe ratio of people paying into Social Security versus the people being supported by it with a much higher number ... the fact of the baby boomer generation is so large is really decreasing that\nAnd making it so that there's fewer workers to basically take care of the people that are are in need of the system and so if you think about it in terms of peaks and valleys\nIf the baby boomer generation it out of their peak spending years but the millennial generation isn't quite and their peak spending years then part of it is simply that we're in a quote unquote valley so to speak in terms of population density in what they're looking for and what they're spending to the degree that it can spur economic growth\nRight right very much so and then you know it is it's interesting as\nAs we shift and shoot generation action a millennial generation\nThis would be um generation X. starting to ... born in Nineteen sixty four if I'm not mistaken and even allowing 'cause they keep\nChanging but do you do [laughter] they do but I think currently then generation ... about Nineteen eighty or eighty one and number ... start from there and I I Believe the millennial generation while they can\nStill be the millennial generation we're well into it now so I don't know that's going to be and and I'll tell you our experience has been all of the generation of actors and the millennials\nGreat thing to get into I'm looking at a new nothing would make money here and then a two thousand six and seven things started to change them two thousand they because of the subprime mortgage priceless primarily housing values went down in a big way and people were really really strong I'm surprised by what happened\nIn the interesting thing is you know if we look back historically and I'm sure the Detroit out there\nWhat we experience in the housing market in a way to nine probably wasn't the first time there is probably other times throughout history churn were real estate bubble popped or real estate just with stagnant or ... so the question is you know what happened that we forgot histories lesson [laughter]\nIt's so interesting that and I mean while and you can talk about history in general I'm Talking about um government some talk about the way people live their lives but especially in the financial world people seem to have such short memories and if things are good now that\nThey think they'll always be good and the stock market has been doing so well for ten years everyone's saying oh the stock market has been great and I'm just gonna keep investing in the stock market down them again and there'll be a downturn and not for a while everyone will be cautious and none of my back to the same thing so I don't know why the memories are\nSo short yeah I I don't either\nYou're right it's not just money but in terms of just our perspective we tend to repeat these historical patterns over and over and over I I remember probably a couple of years ago a tag we were talking to another financial advisor in and they were basically asking this question which is\nYou know if you were driving in a car and you got in a car wreck\nDon't you think after the wreck you drive a little safer\nAnd we thought about and we're like well of course you would you know if I if I have a car wreck I'm going to be a little bit trepidation following the wreck because I don't want to have another right but the idea is well wouldn't it have been better to have been more preventative to have driven a little safer prior to the right to to avoid direct you know whether you have it as kind of too late [laughter]\n[laughter] well and that's really what\nDo you have maybe the ... a lot of what we're talking about in terms of retirement income as is to be very\nSensible as you get close to retirement years to\nJust safeguard the pool of money and there were a tire my portfolio that you have because you're getting very close to starting to use it and you don't want to see if deplete by twenty or thirty or forty percent\nA year or two before you're going to use it because you're is trying to change everything about to retire but if you see a big\nHit on the value of right before your butts are\nYeah I think that's absolutely true in the bigger issue\nFor all of that is you know there is no one size fits all I think that we so often want to have a simple explanation and rationale and in prescribe methodology so if we could say well\nYou know because of all of that therefore you should do X Y and Z like you know go put all your money in Bonn but it's not that easy there is no one size fits all from an investment standpoint there is no magic looks or so to speak that fix the you know all the issues\nAre we knew it seems to love our lives do do a way of here's easy answer or their way to do this are here the ten most things to do if you're going to do the sorry here's the the selling things to do to save more money are we all low lists like that and and yet\nYou really have to be your own advocate for for so many things in life and retirement finances are certainly one of them on and you're on a hell of a sudden Henry couldn't go on and on with it but you you have to read and learn and ask advice and and just kind of learn about it\nYeah I think that's absolutely true I think when it comes to finance and it's probably true of this and all areas of the things that really get people issues is the things they don't know right it's\nI think that you know we've got it all figured out and you know because such and such work for you know such and such scenario that that didn't universally applicable to my situation and every other situation\nI think that's when we get these blinders of complacency that make us feel like a you know there's nothing to think about there's nothing to worry about\nBecause a problem may not really emerged growing number of years you know\nVery much so and it's up to type of issue you ought to be facing when you're heading into whether it's supposed to be the golden years of your life when you're out of enjoying the fruits of the labor if you will of of all those years you've worked and saved for um you want to enjoy a few years of maybe traveling or having fun and relaxing a little bit\nAnd joining the grandkids and taking life easy a little but I'm a ... and yeah there's a lot of important considerations as you get closer though there's\nYeah I completely agree well it's all the time we have for today tune in next week and we'll continue talking about all things retirement planning financial planning related just trying to give you guys practical wisdom so that you can be very mindful\nWith your money so this is Sam ... and we'll talk to you that things are [noise]\nHave you on a fifty year old male with type two diabetes five hundred thousand of term life insurance

our region was in the fifties and sixties and think about where it was going to be at the turn of the century and say here's where we want to go we want resource like this we want to utility like this\nUm and luckily there were enough like minded people in Illinois that agreed to where you know we find strong public support for it and luckily we had some supporters at the time in the federal government who are willing to bring the idea of cross the\nFinish line Let's go to a Trevor Edmondson mid mid day when project manager for the wetlands since you could morning and welcome morning I'll thank you thank you for being here already tell me how the wetlands initiative is working with Monday what\nWill currently we're doing we're restoring about Eighteen hundred acres run the seven year plan a worrying about your three of that are so we've been here since the early two thousand\nI'm doing a basically adopting sections of ... in restoring them um but this is the biggest restoration that we've done most far and it's a partnership with the U.S Forest Service and the national forest foundation as long as ... like the grand Vicky\nI'm Tori foundation and the Donnelly foundation um\nAnd and and and let me just stop you there because\nThere are a lot of partners here and I saw you have new interpreted signs right at the trail had a and you look out over a field you explain how you made that transition that gradually that you you know the ... you keep it in agriculture but you kind of change it over the course of a few years how does that happen\nWell basically the agriculture allows us to kind of do management um it it seems counter intuitive there but ah by the farmers harvesting it keeps a lot of the weeds out right so it allows us they're doing their dirty work China yeah we can focus on a little more the rough terrain area\nBut ah yeah okay well I noticed that a bike red murder is is nodding and smiling and Mike is a fish and wildlife biologist with the U.S fish and Wildlife Service uh Mike tell me how is the U.S fish and Wildlife Service\nOur ship with the forest service here to coordinate the volunteer program with\nI'm Catherine gourmet and I'm I'm also a volunteer coordinator here ideal primarily with that public services and all that data management behind the scenes um and I am fortunate to work with oh so you're also with a nature preserve I Am yeah OK mhm and I and we got the pleasure\nOh he has he has his own under volunteers from modern was drink beer and I'm a volunteer during the day when I'm going to ... any bird monitor here admit they\nWow so here we are just\nSo as I mentioned that uh the day when volunteer program as coordinated by the nature conservancy we're in a special a partnership with the forest service here and we also are really reliant upon what makes that I haven't even easier as a million dollar donation from center point in a remote all which is a corporate neighbor\nUp the road here and they just haven't see as managing a million dollar donation and then in ... so it makes it easy now for volunteers to not only contribute their time but also financial support as well excellent\nThe nature conservancy is is just a wonderful organization um and I would imagine a and maybe the uh the actual folks worked for the forest service could speak to this but I'm sure you guys get this place can operate unless you have oh and cheers right\nThat's right the volunteer program I provides a huge momentum eyes towards Monday ones mission to move forward volunteers are involved with a ... almost everything they possibly can be a missionary related here at um the day when so that's\nUm you know Katherine primarily is coordinating the archaeology program and everything that are services including youth education um you know Frank as representing you know he has a ... he runs a lotta the interpreter programs here and also it was a bird monitor\n'em and then I Am specifically coordinating all things prairie restoration and ecological monitoring like\nYou know we have how do we know what's working how do we know the prairie restoration or quality and diverse we have volunteers out here monitoring you know plants and a rare plans and fluorescent quality of plants and birds and butterflies and fries and water quality it you know of the streams\nSo all that data gets reported on in order for us to kind of you know look at the management here and see if we have to change things as we go along so we're\nTalking about citizen science yet her way up yet and we talk about that a lot on the show and how important citizen science is\nAnd when your dog volunteers I'm sure a lot of folks say hey that'd be fun I'm gonna go out and watch birds and I've got a you know object something in the ground but it also involves reports doesn't it and it involves a recording the the observations you make yet\nIt it definitely does involve data collection I'm so like our burden monitors like Frank I bear or they get the\nEnjoyment of going out and to um Monday on natural areas and seeing all the birds that they can see but they do what they submitted to us and then we process it altogether actually a lot of that data is available on our website if people are interested in ...\nAnd the website is\nFs that USDA that gum forward slash Monday when that would be ... Web site or we have a lot of volunteer information to and then the nature conservancy you can read more about them I nature dot org\nAnd what what trends you sing in the last few years of data\nCollection especially with Bert ... well the there's a lot of different birds that um that people are monitoring I mean there's about a hundred and twenty different species okay and then even more when you're considering the migratory populations so we have different types of ways that are volunteers are collecting that and staff and local professionals\nSome of them are point counts whether you know listening and and documenting everything that they hear or see within a hundred meters right and then we I volunteer is doing a lot of supplemental data\nSo what we're saying is that we are certainly having more bird population supported here with a diversity in the open up more on fragmented areas then you would see you know that would be fragmented by roads and infrastructure and things like that\nSo uh we're pretty happy with on seeing that data\nWith bird data in general we have some of the longest trends that we've seen because we've been monitoring birds they're even before Monday when it was a satellite and Frank and maybe some of those yeah ... says he gets ... microphone a little closer\nTo your friend sure I'm ... I enjoy seeing is a strike every now and again rowdy which are bird and what they do is they do they're killing by shaking the bird vigorously and then and then putting it on the barbed wire hawk for Nader consumption yes pretty cool\nIt is a yeah if you if you're like blood and Gore of uh [noise] so what kind of birds do they go after will they go after small rows and rows of small okay I'm Sorry that's on snakes okay yeah oh yeah okay\nSo the the beauty of nature\nCan be seen in it's a brutal affects however it's part of what we do around here is a scene or what it is that the birds are are doing my knee trends they have and how we can translate that to the visitors because a lot of folks don't have the time to do a lot of the research that we can do or some of\nFor the reading so the more that we can give our visitors from Neil sketches of behavior in habitat the better it is for them\nMake their stay here that much more enjoy\nYour so walk me through a a a a quick morning here that you you come to do some observation how does it start and and and what do you look I mean are you are you going to the bar Boyer and looking for a the the remnants of what your bird up there you know something\nThat is one way to see if there if you haven't been around however what we do is when we get here trying located where the by some ... visitors come here we've had direct them in the right wing yes\nRanger responsibility not ... okay All right yeah I was asking you about the bird monitoring but uh but you are are you doing all of those tasks at once yes\nYou can ... a bird monitor a setting is is a prescribe time and they let you go however my role is interpreted rangers as we're walking through the overlooks in different places we can see what birds are becoming\nAnd in painting found a lot like about ...\nIf confirmed Kavanaugh could be seated next week New York democratic congressman Gerry Adler gave this week democratic address he said it was important for a doctor Christine Blasey Ford to testify before the Senate Judiciary committee forward it's one of the women who accused cabin on sexual misconduct\nNow they are also talked about the complaints he shares from constituents about the Trump Administration\nI could list any number of issues that have been ignored by the Republican majority since President Trump took office including the corruption that is permitted the president whose family members of his administration to reap personal financial benefits from industries they got all at the expense of ordinary citizens\nThe first lady is heading home after her first solo overseas trip to Africa millennia Trump that did it for country\nI thought for capital throw\nProvided him has changed\nOr on the fourth of July\nThe first lady also said that she supports Kavanaugh's confirmation and that she doesn't always agreed with the president's tweet a Vietnam War veteran charged with murder for an attack that killed ...

friday or Saturday Night\nSo we that's what we always did also was we took a look and I think it's a great idea for kids to do now\nIs let's think outside the box and not everything is not just going to the movie theater or doing what your parents that were looked for yourself to see some adventures some things that you could do in your community what's you know what's happening around that could be even if you just go to play bingo could be a kick once wrote you know once a\nMoon whatever a blue moon but something different and so we said we had a gang gang of maybe ten people to traits to

just by God I get somebody's gonna make that comment about me and stuff all the time I was out of uh what do you say you remember oh vividly what do you remember about oh just remember just\nDoing it would just it was cool that we were doing something like that I thought it was really cool it was probably your idea yeah and um so I Love the idea and the movie was so great\nLike I had no idea I didn't know who James Dean was a I kind of had an idea but when you actually see the movie on a relatively big screen and you and I were teenagers a good time to see that movie\n'cause he kinda connected to it in certain ways and just the idea that we did something out of the norm itself which was really great and I remember it to the day\nYeah that's that's what's amazing 'cause that's for forty ... whatever amount of years ago like that and and it's close to forty years and I remember it as well er and most other people we went with to do that\nWe went to I see the light show or in the dining vendor planetarium your first time I heard a Led Zeppelin songs they played it in a planetarium it did back in the day I don't think they do it in the ... like a laser light show our right there to music\nGo on the ... what he did was he took\nHis students up and down in a hallway of pictures of the other classes from many years before and all those students had the same aspirations that same look in their eyes that same hope that seem dreams same thought that they were invincible and so forth\nAnd said to them they're all passed away\nThey're All right now you know what do they call it you know feed for fodder for the worms worms or what have you but the point is we're not here forever so I think the great message of that and I think it's not lost on anyone everyone as seen that movie it's no secret that\nThe message just try to you know do something\nThat you want to do while you're here or does that make any sense of joy absolutely pitch 'cause you could ignore it and all of a sudden your your your window of opportunity to do what it was you wanted to do was gone that's right you know what ... what do you want to do\nThat you haven't done yet or or have you done everything you wanted to the men's room oh you mean [laughter] you know you know I there's still some\nThings I Want to do I like to do I like to I'd like to uh get back into maybe recording some new music good I haven't done that a long time yeah you know some stuff like that more creative stuff\nRight that I've been doing and and that's you know we do get into that raising family paying bills whatever and you lose your if your creative person you haven't doing that for a living you you lose that since you lose that 'cause you got to do other things and uh so yeah I think it's I think\nHaving friends around that kind of reminds you of what your dreams were back in the day and maybe help you get there as David has with mine and this show is is significant ended nice outlet but um maybe ... you know if you're listening into your younger person or maybe it's a good lesson to try to\nGrab onto that dream and and keep it and try to get it while you're in your twenties they'll wait like I did until I was in my fifties you know what I mean\nBut there's nothing wrong with waiting 'til your fifties in your fifties either it's just you know life happens right as long as you do it doesn't matter what your age is not do it\nMake you make your life what did he say that last quote\nAttack was at a whatever he has to stop if you I Know it's a [laughter] well that's what happened to him it's just I ... I mean I Can't watch that movie that is true that said uh anyway now\nAndy Griffith I played this previously but I Love this because it's now turned the tide a little bit I Want to talk about school and how sometimes school and it's subject in school can actually be fun if that makes any sense\nWhat am I going to lose a leg\nPain ... bread codes and you know history for the craziest good and\nOh they had they had a gun and fired a shot of us are clear around the world very thing you know four five for the last\nGuy the guy the guy that got a good shot that can be heard around the world that was [laughter]\nWell uh there was this fell off you sure you want to hear their stories history\nStarring\n[laughter] how I\nThought that was previously but you know a teacher can make a a you know a history and one of the subject is come alive for people like that or for this you know their students it's just a it's such an advantage such a great way to learn and you have any teachers like that ever are not\nSure I had them in college up to ... even in college I had teachers like that they would you know\nDo something different and actually made make the subject matter more interesting however they want her to do whether it was like acting out old you know characters in history or giving scenarios from their own life about what happened just something to humanize it for you or made a big difference I remember that to this day\nYeah and I and and I do too and and uh you don't think you you would remember or that and we'll talk about this in the next section about teachers so to speak but\nAlso the subjects themselves I Would say this sometimes in school or you don't know you know such a high school does this pressure going to go to college what are you going to major in what's going to do what are you going to do what do you do with the rest of your life you know he's sixteen Seventeen I don't really know that\nBut maybe you know maybe\nThat those particular subject to to to you talk is not your bag so maybe you could eliminate at least a couple of things that you know from the from the table and see what's left standing\nAs opposed to picking one out of all of a lifted that makes me sad you know makes total sense so at least you know if I had any advice to give anyone possibly would listen to me for advice that that would be something at least knocks them stuff off\nFor ... and not just I don't like it or not good at it no for a real reason as you know you're really not apt to jump the owner the aptitude or the desire or whatever but um you know the other side of things to do some things you\nYou have skills for that you you don't like doing\nRight next to you know that you've been one of the planet to to do math let's say and do the math related you don't like it which are really great at it\nYou know that right definitely happens so in that way you got to struggle with am I going to go down that path and I were all given certain cards to play and it's um\nIt's not easy to figure out how to bluff for to to go all in that mix center exactly so that's a it's hard so anyway ah we we took a turn to the serious here on everything will just do it given our\nBack to school and I looked back to school or is there something Mr Cohen that uh you want to add to any of these stories that we've\nWe've we've jumped over any of these stories as we were more section left in one minute here\nKnow how to run on the spot yeah put me on the spot I'm you well I Do I remember I'm\nThinking back now you and I had gone with the whole group of people to see a movie called\nThe warriors remember the warriors I don't know if you remember seeing that movie yes and everyone we went way of just love the movie and we spent and I didn't really know you that well time but we sat next to each other we spent a lot of the movie\nJust like looking at each other in laughing at the movie was so ridiculous and I knew like okay I like I like I my wavelength right you know and I think that I don't know why it just hit me now but maybe we were talking about the James Dean moving\nWhen we went to see that but that was a connection that I I remember maybe it

that they're funny this movie though feel like it should have been made about ten years ago it feels like if they respond to the Robert Downey junior Sherlock Holmes and they just finally got around to making\nIt feel out of time it out of place I mean even if it would have been made five years ago like when the b._b._c. was re doing\nWatching them he he was into that movie that is a great movie it's one of my favorite of all times\nAnd and it's the best version of it I think I Love the original with Kevin McCarthy but the one in Nineteen Seventy eight with Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams is so visceral and pragmatic and realistic and and and the tops the other remake that they did like in Nineteen Ninety three they did one with Gabrielle Anwar and they did a remake\nIn two thousand seven I think with a Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig that was kind of a mass\nNineteen Seventy two really good one but the other thing I Do with my kids every year and this goes back to me when I was in high school there was a theater in town called the correct so north than it was the big eight hundred and seek theater that it's now a fitness center\nWhich is sad in ... but it was the big eight hundred feet the Internet they do twenty four hour marathons where they show twelve or Thirteen horror movies all night long and they'd have trailers and cartoons and a short film the little bits and bumpers that that's always made it very\nSpecial that experience now I was in high school in the eighties so that was your only option some of these movies yeah should VHS but you're also looking at it on a Nineteen inch TV\nIn your parents' basement and you weren't watching them on the big screen so I Would go to these all night movie marathons and I loved it there was a huge deal for me in the late eighties and early nineties now they still do them because the scheduling and some other things happening my life I'm not able to go to them all the time\nBut it's a little easier to do them at home you know because we have better TV's we have Blu ray and and and what I also do I do a mini marathon now every year for my family\nOf horror movies he used to be twenty four hours but I don't have the strength for that anymore I Do like twelve or Thirteen hour fourteen hour horror movie marathon\nAnd you know I had like my dad come over and my kids were there and my wife was doing concessions and I put together trailer blocks and are we watch cartoons like looney tunes and so it's a lot of fun and I make it as much like a theatrical experiences possible\nThis year to the movies that we watched I wanted to review on this show and I might drop a couple of later on because they're classics and one of the things that I've done as a parent and a movie lover is I have\nMade a point to expose my kids not just to the movies that are out there in the theaters right now those are great you know I Love taking my kids with the marvel movies and the star wars movies and all that good stuff\nBut I also like them to the older film and I'm not just talking about ... stuff that I saw when I was a kid or like I mentioned I watched the beach in the body Snatchers Nineteen Seventy eight version with my son the other day\nOver the four versions of a star is born I've only seen two of them I've seen the movie with James Mason and Judy Garland from the fifties I've not seen the Barbra Streisand movie from the seventies and I've never seen the original but here's the thing with this movie this movie feels like it's training for a million ...\nNot just because it's the fourth movie of stars born it's like the four hundred movie of self destructive music star's\nIt doesn't matter whether the bio pic like walk the line or re or a fictional thief like as far as born these movies tend to follow the same trajectory was telling my my mom I I went to go see this and I said I referred to it as a bingo movie\nIt's a kind of movie where I feel like I have a card and I got to go OK okay music star going down in his career check alcoholism check drug abuse on to check a you know somebody until Mather ripping things off the wall check up and go and you get all the stuff that you need that things are supposed to have it in a movie like this\nIs not my cup of tea I'm going to say that right now I Know I fully aware that this was like the greatest movie that ever came out at Toronto in Telluride and it's getting the greatest ... ever and people are already say just don't really anymore he's this year this is a best picture\nPeriod I Know people are saying that I disagree this is not the first time that I Am not agreeing with a lot of my critical breath\nAnd that's okay that's what's great about movies is everybody can have a different opinion now with that said it is an impeccably made movie it is very well done from a filmmaking standpoint the directing very good Bradley Cooper does a good job\nI don't know how much of it to him doing a good job or if he's having his hand held because that happens a lot when a star as an actor when they do their first movie as a director sometimes\nOther directing but you're getting a lot of help\nAnd sometimes they're actors who can do but you know Mel Gibson is a fantastic director I Know it was an anti Semite but he's a fantastic director ... ... what it is a good actor but he's also a great director\nAnd they're definitely doing their own thing I I still need to see a couple of more Bradley Cooper movies that he directed before I can fully say that this is authentically him alone doing but it's well directed the music's very good\nThe songs are performed very well including Bradley Cooper doing his own performances of course Lady Gaga is good she's she's fantastic\nShe's an incredibly talented woman I Love the fact that you're getting the kind of see a raw version of her you know she is so known for the kitchen the costumes and the the wacky moments that you forget she's an incredibly talented woman who has a great boy\nAnd she does a great job in the movie the acting is quite good he's good she's good you got to I'm Elliot and there is good you know you did it from a filmmaking simple in its very well done\nIt just has no interest to me whatsoever and I I've seen some from some of my critical breath run out there\nWho complain about people saying oh how dare you say that it's not your interests will not just about your interest just about how the movies made and how it's told I'm like no you got to have an interest in the movie if you have an interest in that if you want to watch self destructive musicians ruin their lives on the big screen\nYou can turn on the TV [laughter] watch the news or you can go see this movie\nAnd a lot of ways it's just misery important to me though I just it's just cut wrenching to be gut wrenching it's ... it's just roaring out as much emotion and anger and pain out of the viewer as possible I Am not\nInto and if you're not into that it's going to be a terrible movie if you are into it it's going to be fantastic and I I'm not going to standing away from seeing but I'm here to say no let's pump the brakes on this one first of all it's not for everybody second of all\nIt is okay to not like this movie it is also okay to have no interest in seeing it and then I see\nYes the performances are good but if you're not interested in seeing the movie don't see the movie I had to and I don't consider it the best year sorry I'm going against the grain on this one and I'll probably be repeating myself for the next several months as we roll adored season\nBut I have to say that the stars born kind of stuck it can is that\nWhen they did that and I liked it so that\nYou're listening and in fact I that the movies with Kevin car let's talk about venom Tom Hardy started with an investigative journalist to bonds with an alien parasite that gives him superpower [noise]\n... even more rituals were ever\nPeople [laughter]\nWe up in the first time we saw that I'm On the big screen was in Spiderman three eleven years ago\nIt was not particularly done well the version of venom that you saw on Spiderman three was not the version of venom that you saw the comment I never read the comic books I've just heard plenty of fans of the comic books complain about that so when they got a new better movie they're given a stand alone that a movie there was a lot of excitement and the ...\nAnd to their credit they get their own better movie it is that um and and other alien parasites but it's basically that\nTom Aarti very good in this movie you can actually hear what he says he faces and covered [laughter] when he's talking like Mad Max or the dark Knight Rises or dung Kirk he does find in a movie in fact I think he elevated the movie way more than a really should be\nThe story is really I mean\nIt's got the billionaire or trying to colonize other planets got this weird environmental message but this anti you know ...\nMillion or message you know it it's got like things happening you hear the story construction moments where you're like well I don't even understand\nHow that pragmatically happens you know they're stealing homeless people in running experiments on them and then making them disappear but somehow they're stealing them and having an signed waivers but then they dumped them in a landfill to get rid of it it's the strangest\nSet up of a movie that I've seen that that takes so much time to explain\nThe nuance of what they're doing with it making notes that\nAlso the acting ... good everyone else's terrible Michelle Williams is going to move she plays his girlfriend or is ex girlfriend and\nShe's awful in this movie and and I'm not a huge fan of Michelle Williams but I've seen her movies and I there are times when I think she's done quite well I thought you would actually she was one of the best thing to Brokeback Mountain I thought she was the best performance and that one I thought she was a fantastic performance in Manchester by the seat\nOf the ones that she gets a lot of accolades for stuff like my week with Marilyn I'm like that\nOne was dumb I didn't like her in that so she kind of blows hot and cold boy she pulls really called on this one she is terrible in this movie the other thing with the movie it's it's very an even if it feels like it was shot to be are rated\nAnd I think they were going for that they're going for a violent greedy you know something that could stand up with Logan or that point\nBut then they decided to make a PG Thirteen and so it seems very ... the editing is really clunky especially in the action sequences like a point where venom like killed somebody and then they leave and then you don't see any remains you know even the splatter and you're like but that doesn't even make any sense so feel like they really sanitizing in a lot of ways\nAnd then on top of it they put this comedy in there they put the sort of lap sticky goofy moment that do not work in and dark of a movie at the\n... and they really are jarring it it's almost like to add more comedy we need we need to be funny 'cause the comic book movie in that way it feels like it was made at like the ... century\nYou know those field more in line with something like ... or the movie daredevil with Ben Affleck ... ghostwriter with Nicholas cage all that stuff that came out before the summer of two thousand eight\nWhen the dark Knight and Iron Man ... totally changed the field\nThat step things up that was when marvel studios started making their movies and that's when the dark Knight really said hey this is what superhero movies could be\nBut otherwise it's really uneven I'm I'm going to have to say the venom kind of sucks because well it can is fat milk that's it for this segment I Need to go to a break when I come back I'm going to be talking about retro puppet master box office and the home front of a round up the train tales from the hood\nTo fire

I remember seeing the original tales from the hood back in the nineties I watched it on HBO or on VHS at some point and I thought it was okay I got it about a year and a half ago to review on Blu ray they they had a collectors edition Blu ray\nAnd I actually thought it held up as a film better than I thought it worked back in the nineties it's very heavy hand and it's not a subtle movie\nBut the original sales wonder who actually is\nYou know it's kind of an interesting film and it told these moralistic tailed than clunky with them but it also has some really interesting moment than it does it does deal it's a social commentary movie as much as good as a horror movie and so tell\nDifferent a tale dealing with social issues whether it's racial issues or domestic violence\nRoughly ... who directed and start in that movie\nAlso direct this one ... along with Darren Scott and it's kind of some of the same people involved Spike Lee's involved and produce and yet you got kicked David taking over the role that was played by Clarence Williams in the original movie\nNot exactly sure what Clarence Williams in return you know you might be just getting too old I mean he you know Twenty years since then he's in his late seventies\nSo keep David fought and you choose the scenery wraparound story it's it's really bonkers I mean it's it's really heavy handed and it's the problem with this movie as opposed to help from the hood is tells them to there is no subtlety whatsoever\nThere is no certain subtly and it's sort of a a containment of the first movie this one just goes off the deep end and and like to go to the stories are\nVery on the nose and goofy at the same time there's one about the sort of like this pretty white girl wanting to get these golly walk racist dogs from I'm from a museum and and then of course they did it turns into a big doll and children but if we're looking it's just it's not scary it's\nYou know you can take something that looks cute and clever and make it a horrifying or you can fail at that and make it silly and that's what happens in this movie and then there's one story that that that that's told that kind of had some interesting elements to it in terms of talking about the civil rights movement and and and how that started\nBut it's so spoon feeding everything to you and then even when it works out how the ending works that doesn't even make sense and and even if I'm watching this movie it's about this though the rapper runs about the weapons dealer who's making is basically a robo cop and he's having this undertaker come in and tell her story so it can develop a moral high ground\nIt did that makes no sense the premise of it it's just so hard to swallow\nAnd it it just gets silly it's it's not nearly as well put together and well constructed as the first woman the first one was already kinda shaky anyway going and I have to say tales from the hood to totally swore\n\nThe other new movies that are out on DVD

stuff works right and so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Costco\nSo I took a picture and send it off through the gap and then I made like seven bucks my ... that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the app store it's a legitimate ... is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one called folk\n... that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that

a little too good it's called beauty gate that's right the new cameras automatically softening skin smoothing skin\nAnd they said due to the computational photography features supplying a filter without telling you\nOr somebody else that I notice that the for the camera photos are heavily smooth it looks pretty bad\nAnother one that looks like I have makeup on beauty mode to be honest well this was the fact of the front facing camera\nOr is actually working and a lot of folks were actually happy about it there was one person who said that it was a smoothing effect and they actually have never looked at that and good in their entire life and so\nUnique gate and I apologize yes that was Oh yes that was my watch that went off simultaneously\nPerfect transition to the history of the mountain cut how embarrassed cell phone ringing right on the\nPrize my laptop didn't go off at the same time okay like that's not annoying\nSo yes this do do do you get a little history yes until you went back in time because we were texting back and forth\nAnd I was curious about the fur or about your first phone yeah and that kind of launched a conversation about the history of self ... my first cell phone when the big brick phone okay just to break away from\nNineteen eighty Miami by yes okay oh and it was like so cool to have that phone and I remember like carrying around saying like a by ten thousand you know [laughter]\nSo that they were like oh God she must be like a trust fund our she must be on Wall street person looking at are so cruel or or yeah and I have my your shoulder pads oh my God I had to show that I had like the big hair going on\nI was hot so I Want to picture you paint during the game now what was your first call or my first phone was the Motorola flip phone where the battery was the exact same size as the phone\nI remember that was it was cute but that the razor no it was the Motorola like cutesy five seven for I think that was before it was I think that was before the rates yeah and I ordered it on from an infomercial yeah on television it was like at two o'clock in the morning infomercial\nAnd they're like you know in the normal infomercial thing you ever been lost in the woods and now you can get a phone it was like two hundred and sixty dollars getting St law\nDon't they don't they did in people who have done infomercial [laughter] [laughter] not a ideas\nAs much as they're buried cheesy but very effective I was sixteen oh he's sixteen\nI better than what if I get lots of what can you know me I got captured all the time yeah I Know you're really into that doesn't even work in the woods [laughter]\nAnd he was so heavy and it was like a hundred and eighty five dollars per month for the plan I could not written letters a month yeah so my dad called them and said you know you sold this to a minor\nYou cannot have a contract with a minor and so they can as long as you tend to fall back they would cancel the contract okay I was only sixteen years old that's funny that was my first thought the actual first cell phones though\nWas available to passengers on a German training\nOnly in first class passengers and it was all the way back in Nineteen twenty six\nReally I Would have never guessed that the first ever phone with all the way back in Nineteen twenty six forty years later okay this is like a fun fact that you need to know for like oh yeah real pursuit her some games are truly doesn't exist anymore because of a cell phone\nBut ... you can convince people to keep their phones in their pocket and the good when you could get a case of the first thing you could say when was what year was the first cell phone rang\nAnd it was available to first class passengers and German train route now Twenty years later Nineteen forty six in America\nWe had the first car phones that were available publicly oh I remember having a car following so cool that was like there was like the nineties yeah I get it in their forties Nineteen forty six they were using radio waves but some of the bandwidth was so limited\nThey had got their first couple of customers and everything was filled up there was no more room for anyone to make phone that many customers they have\nUnder a hundred I Know in Sweden at the same time their car foreign service was available and they have maxed out at a hundred and twenty five customers\nYeah that that's crazy I didn't realize that it went that far back I had no idea I would've guessed the late seventies most yeah I Would have said the seventies in the seventies Motorola they came out with their first ever put public cell phone\nOr that was available and they made their first ever public cell phone call on a device that weighed two and a half pounds that the big phone\nThat's a heavy phone imagine a cell phone if the technology did not advance and we were still carrying around a whole lot I got to get my phone [laughter] ... could you live there for me like back in the killing me just hold it for us to attack okay\nSo we we jump forward another decade okay in the late eighties the GSM standard I remember that the mobile standards were established world why would you basically opened up the cell phone industry so now it can begin to grow commercially\nSo Nineteen Ninety two you know what happened in Nineteen Ninety two\nUh the first text message with

radio okay uh and then he shows we were in the front where a piece of the car doesn't really match\n... for a hundred and twenty thousand dollar car\nAnd I'm like you know I felt like I said that's

the voice mail phone number I didn't recognize a robocall well it's actually getting a lot worse\nCrazy story that I have to tell you about how voice fishing scams are getting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this\n... bags in a small Portland credit union last week he got a call themselves from it from an eight hundred number that matched the number that his credit union uses actually he got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession\nHe didn't answer the first to just let it go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh wow this must really be important I should answer ...\nSo he was greeted by a female voice who explained that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio made to his debit ATM card [noise] she then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I'm going to replace them card immediately about travel added states California well the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card or we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California or does the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California Oregon so not a problem\nAny charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\n\nOr where to freeze the card everywhere else and he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably do me a favor she didn't said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up I just want you to feel comfortable\nIs this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect ... is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said it just the correct spelling of your mother's me yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify the three digit code printed on the back of the card in your wallet is this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet\nAnd he said yeah uh yeah\nSo at this point everything seem printed pretty legit right\nThen she says\nSo that I can apply that same PIN number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you I can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work\nUh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now\nAnd he said oh okay well you know here's my forte independent card\nMaybe hang up and then he looked at as account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the day earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars a there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there's a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account so what the scammer had was every single thing about him\nExcept for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had to put the cart she had been number she had everything in front of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhy would they get all that information that guard dog when it's on the dark Web ...\nCrazy stuff don't do any banking on the phone in the bank calls known dancers yo ... hang up and go to the bank that's it I I'd Chaz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin either shed\n[noise] has

probably about ten minutes ago right so we're in light of all of these things I mean you just mentioned about technology and you mentioned about monitoring couch I'm dumb primary\nLarge amount of the people that call it generally seniors are they tend to be a good target for fraudsters what do you think is probably the best reason for them to get involved or stay involved on line with technology and what's the biggest reason than your mind that would be beneficial to them\nAnd what why do you ask\n'em personally I've run into the worst um I've I've [laughter] I've seen and heard it all over the many many years that have been doing this\nUh I've talked to many Rand is over the past um [noise]\nI've dealt with the truck scams that you mentioned um and all of those are very personal one universal thing pretty much comes into play and unless something dramatic cap so vast majority of these things I discovered after the fashion or if they are\nSomebody who is still gets a paper statement then they get up at the end of the month [laughter] it's it's far the money's long gone\nAnd the ability to recover is is just you know that that's a good point you're right Korea's position that that's a real\nThat's a really good point is that I'm thinking of even my mother she get the paper statement at the end of the month right by the time you get the statement your account can be wiped out exactly so I feel you know so ... they're so the whole thing is to educate right\nTo do and how are people so and the power seniors that this is what's happening these are things that you need to be careful of these are things that you need to watch out for if you have a family member who's elderly these are also things that\nYou need to pass a law because they are the prime target because they are lonely they're vulnerable uh they may not necessarily keep track of everything they may not get a text message like we do on their phones every time a transaction happens

hours\nLike that from sweetwater Texas I Lived for them to your program a very excellent show and uh my quest such day was I have a two thousand seven dodge\nIt's a thirty five voters got the five ... of it in my air conditioned to point out uh all of a sudden a lot of pressure will not kick on\nAnd off very well with a look into late or the next day\nOr one now to start the truck and a truck has got to put the dead of they had any problems with America leisure simply for the fact that I've always on the court [laughter] but anyhow I could help me out I've greatly appreciated\n...\nWe have had a a friend of ours that we buy palettes from and he had some continuing issues with a a ram and that same era with the air conditioning and I'm not the one that manages a shop like rush those when he's here but I Know that in that particular instance\nThey\nDid some battle with the fact that some of the control for that air conditioning system in that vehicle runs back through the power train control module through the engine computer\nAnd so it is it is possible now having said this this is a possibility it with something being a\nShortage in the ... in the watch or something like that that it could be turning on and and uh causing a drain on the on the battery because of that short in the air conditioning compressor so the first thing that person is going to do is give it a physical analysis to see All right\nDo we have refrigerated system let's just start with the low hanging fruit is the system charged up is the clutch free or or is the clutch itself seized up are locked up where it's constantly engaged\nAnd then you have to start working your way way back to the electrical system but I Know that was a a challenge for them on that one and so many other trucks that go down the road\nPulling things work trucks the the cooling system in the front and gets just compromise considerably and if it needs to be considered every time we're going to work on the air conditioning system to make sure I'm covered a lot of bases here but it makes sure that you always have\nAs good of air flows possible through the front of that vehicle because that air through the air flow that comes through the air conditioning condense or is\nWhat takes that extremely high temperature compress liquid and brings the temperature back down again to bring it through the process and so you know after it's been through the compressor had there's a lot of heat generated and you need to bring that cooling back down again to\nA bent over fins we're we're a good chunk of the front of that thing is is is restricted from air bugs or you know huge amounts of dirt if you've been in a really dirty climate these are all things that have to be considered\nWe'll I think that oh three you've got you should've by now have ... on the back we'll also not drum breaks you can see everything so you know I haven't lost fluid inspected the lines you you're not see anything wrong there if\nYou've got plenty of material on your pad cars that will happen to sometimes when the ... the brakes gets so worn down and you can you can get some\nPretty unusual pedal feel it but they've got to be pretty well worn down for that and I'm going to assume just by how reasonable you talk about your problem that you've you've probably inspected that also so my my first one which would be is that you've got a\nFailure going on are starting to come out with your break master cylinder which is kind of an old school problem and it's by passing up\nBy ... real hard you know I can stand on the pedal it doesn't go down after that you know like it's slipping by either ... or something yeah so you're you're then\nMakes you wonder about whether that's what it is\n[noise] well we all we wait on hooked by anti lock brakes just on plug 'em all that make a difference\nWhy no one we were out at a I talk about the few times when we go out to the driving school we've done a couple of times they disconnect or power down the braces things on some of their cars just to show what it's like to do an emergency braking situation without handle outbreaks and yes the hydraulic should work just the same\nOr a minus the assist of that feature so he pulled the fuse on that it'd be a good way to you could eliminate that from the system but I I really don't think that's where your problem is going to be at I think you're still going to find that problem is somewhere in your\nBreak boost your masters cylinder area are you know you could even have a a a booster that by passing on the inside where an quick hammer it's able to old but then once you get to a certain point it just it's bleeding by the vacuum inside the you know the big diaphragm inside that booster that could also be it\nUm and so I I still think your problems going to be at the head of the unit\nUp near the the ... where everything starts not downstream I ... I really do Gary thanks very much for the call good luck and\nMaybe stop driving it till you're ... I mean they're well and he says he's getting to the end of the pedal yeah I I forgot to ask him but he does he have a red warning light on a cause for other listeners out there\nYou're yellow lights are telling you have a specially on the newer cars with the modern braking systems with analog brakes traction control and dynamic suspension control all these different things\nA yellow light can be an indication of a system trouble\nThat something is out of parameters we can't read us a we'll censor you know it's it's it's a code red light still indicates potential hydraulic failure okay or emergency break is on you know something that is immediate so when you see a red brake light ever\nTake heat a don't think you can drive another hour or to the services that are having check it out if you see a red light you should you should find out what's going on you may be losing hydraulic pressure and you may not be able to stop so that's always something to be concerned about\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Steve Steve you're on the end of ... what can we do for you\nI'm calling about my oldest son out a few years back a uh a poor motor or the heater went out I didn't work on on any level all I did replace it with an after market uh but now it works on uh the first three levels but not for a ...\nI'm a little apprehensive of replacing the poor motor not faking it may be in the square what's your thoughts\nWell most of the systems have a a control of some sort between the switch and\nThe motor and what will always tell people if you've had a motor failure\nIt's always good to look at\nAn apparent you didn't have this problem I I should back up the the the blower motor control oftentimes get burned out when a motor goes bad because it builds up resistance from the circuit it builds up heating circuit and it'll feed back to the to the next device which is usually this this control what a lot of times they'll amount\nIn the heater box or on the X it's on the exterior but it's in there for for air to blow through it and keep it cool and and the old cars they used to be kind of like a thermostat spring coil that would hang down in there is the resistor and it kind of an old school thing that you see and then they've gotten\nMore advanced with the technology now it's a solid state device that will sit in a similar area a lot of times it's melted under the under the dashing ... on the heater boxer near the hitter box but\nIf you can follow that wiring back from the blower motor you typically find this this next piece\nMy hunch is that you may have weakened that when you're blower motor went out the first time and it may have just decided to to give up and that may not be giving you your full range of control because you need a full twelve vote to run that sits at the high speed you don't have\nDirect\nWhich is kind of weird a lot of times they fail out where they they failed and it turned out to stay on the high end not the lower speeds 'cause the the resistor will or the ... seat device will help control that saying don't do it slower speeds\nIt is a bit opposite that way so there's there they can check that system\nI'd say fairly easily for a technician that's got the the right skills because they're going to look for what what current is getting that blower motor and then they're going to work their way back to circuit and my hunch is they might find the problem right there in the in that border control that didn't the intermediate intermediary between the\nThe the switch in the in the motor Steve thanks very much for the call good luck let's talk to John John you're on the under the hood show what can we do for\nA yeah I got a a Ninety five Chevy course of the car with the uh three one ...\nUm

very much for the call that eight six six five nine for for one five oh I just got a message on my phone with a question for you\nSo I wanted to get it out there it was it wasn't rushed to actually you know now okay oh is that stuff that that that yeah I bet I bet he's with them and yeah he has a hard time staying away here's a question how would I determine if a Ford three point eight will both up to a trans where I'd bury tech three point O. is now\nHow do you figure that out well in our in our world that the the recycling facility we have an interchange system but that interchange system\nLooks not only at\nThe physical bolt in have to take into account all the hard wired sensors that have to go into the engine the way the uh in taking fuel injection goes onto the engine the um the cooling you know where the pipes go into ... cylinder heads for for\nAnti freeze and cool and flow it does it take it down to the level of\nAll right these bell housing both up the same oh I Gotcha so when we have to do that well we often do is we'll look into the transmission side of things and see All right\nHow the cars without the Lakers and the oil got\nCombined there I've been trying for which one to attack first on my day job we recently had a big long conversation about driving pet peeves and the number one problem there was a a a greater problem under all of them it was that people don't drive\nAs fast as I wanted to I'm In a hurry I think the number one yet nobody matter as much of a ... but the actual specific problem was firing away people who don't use their bunkers or with the biggest pet peeve with every I mean as you went down the list that was by far the number one named pet peeve\nWith\nA lot of the advanced systems I'm open to blink or will make a comeback you think it'll well in like some cars that you have to hit the link or to turn on their the camera and turn on the camera and or\nIt will shake you ... it'll give you a resistance back on your steering wheel if you even though you don't ... yeah yeah oh that's good\nSo like the lane changes right if you start to turn the wheel it'll tell you you're exactly so if but when the when you turn the Blake are on it overrides that oh that is that so it may bring them blink or back into style\nThat'd be good I Wonder what it's going to do with a middle finger\nWill always have that if you don't think that's a really good automated\nIt would be nice [laughter] just hit a button [laughter] person [laughter] gets a little ... on their info that's so just puts it right out of the way they saw it or not they're going to be displayed right out of state that would be great you cut me off\nThank you pleasure my pleasure now\nWe're talking about as early as a zero twenty is what they went to in the new generation of Silverado was once again we talk about this a lot it's it's bears repeating when they engineer a new power plant like the L. T. one version they call it again that tend to fourteen a newer Silverado versus the older LS version that they had in there\nThey engineer it and it systems with the highest grade petroleum products that are available also and\nSo they went to a a a higher court system they want more capacity and they went to that drove twenty oil so they could have you know the immediate flow that they needed and and plus the synthetic for the long range protection with that ... oh twenty that they use\nThe earlier truck the weight I got the hunch that he was saying that he had an oil consumption issue which wasn't unusual because some of those would have problems with the with the displacement on demand system that\nThe non firing cylinders and the beauty secrets we're not getting lubricate it properly and it would cause\nWhere prematurely and they would start burning some oil in certain cylinders and there was a fix that they put out there eventually to swing that oil a little bit differently\nBut not all of them made it that far [laughter] so I was a little confused about the about the subject on that who the heartland call but he's exactly right they are allowing you to get more range because they're going to hire capacity systems and of course their engineering that newer engine with a\nHighly engineered oil that is what you have to using that injured those so I don't think he was asking about using a different oil but definitely use the recommended oil that has uh the the qualifications of what that factory said you're supposed to happen that's what they engineered that engine\nI Want to come back to the automated die in a minute let's talk to Patrick in Oregon Patrick you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nA question about my twenty court called Honda Odyssey and I'm totally defied whether I have a warm front and gets on my breaks or that I have a bad tire and how do I ... the tail\nTypically if it's a break disc that's worked\nYour only get typically only get a field that on a a light normal breaking situation where you're just\nSlightly writing to break you'll get you'll you'll feel that pole station under late breaking because you're rolling to the ... the last few yeah you you just kind of can feel it then that's when a a a disc workers typically going to show up if they are bad enough I've seen of affect the vehicle as his running down the road for sure but they've got to be pretty bad\nA tire out of alignment\nWill be something that you can have happen at a certain speed or certain road driving situation regardless of your of your break pressure or any of that attire situation can also be changed by rotating the tires and moving the problem around\nIs is a nice way to do it rotating tires is it for quite as easy as it used to be because you have to most vehicles you have to re sequence the tire pressure monitoring monitoring systems\nSome vehicles have a way if you read the owners made all that you could do it by yourself on board some vehicles do require you to to have someone with a tool that can recalibrate the tired the correct position of the vehicle but\nIf you've already been ignoring your tire pressure sensitive center it's no big deal out of two thousand\nFourteen an artist yeah I'm going to guess he's concerned about ... ... to get it right but does that help is that\nI Will go ahead building the two is that I have all the steering great I I it on brand new paper it up you will just a slight it's kind of a bump up as soon as I hit the brakes they won't actually harder to drop either direction but the game will shake them violently\nThat that makes me think you've got you've got worked front brake or owners they got overheated and and uh the the material on it was a lot sooner than it used to be if a if you had one heavy breaking situation or one time where the brakes really hot and then they might have got wet super quick that can can cause that it's not\nIt's not normal you don't have to go round dodging water put right but it can happen if they if they're really warm and then they get cool down quick\nOr that can happen but what you're describing I Would I Would lean towards the front brake rotors\nSure All right so one other question I have ... on a different at all\nI have a friend of mine who has a couple of shooting dogs that don't like to get warm so when she gets out of the car she likes to leave it running but her new or let's say six pull out that shuts off after I think at our physical\n... is there a remote start auction is that a you know we reprogramming option that would show that on that day at all\nThinking about this the the easiest solution would be to teach the dogs to dry right that's always the easiest usually a lot better yeah if the\nWe just know how to drive we'd have to solve or maybe they could learn how to just start the car back up right where it's shorter than the dog I don't know how to do that what I'm trying to think on that car if you had if you had another another key fob\nCould you just on some cars they won't let you lock the vehicle of ... in it but could you could you leave the father in the car and and just simply you know leave it running like its idling describes\nEr and I tried to tried using the remote start function or just let it run\nLeave leave the key in the national is actually able to mechanically lock the door walks away ten minutes later the cars ... sets up kind of a mission that feeling where chefs itself off after idol or something in that\nWell a lot of that they do to for safety if people what happened to do that by accident in their garage or anything like that they'll have a a shut off on it\nHello my name is ... we have a two\nThousand seven Nissan just about eighty seven thousand miles on the road for some under a little bit of sounds like squeaking perhaps onto the good\nTook it and get it checked doesn't really need the ... changed it only has a de seven thousand miles on it crashed we should be holding off on that noise that just minor it's not it's very hard to hear what it's like\nA member of the great question money to take a swing at this one sure I can have your feeling Pepe a change\nThat did it eighty seven thousand miles is I Would say a hundred and ... vis a vis I'm winging that's making a hundred thousand it's probably about the the uh interval on that and since it's squeaking it's telling you maybe there's I mean I Would go ahead and change it nothing bad will happen\nI'm worried about the eleven years yeah there you go it's the time and the elements of eleven years is a is a long time\nMost recommendations are going to be half of that to replace the main accessory built on a lot of these vehicles now having said that I've had numerous ones that I've taken past the five to say I really wouldn't do that but but\nIf you're starting to if it's starting to talk to you and they believe it's coming from the belt you want to look at the belt and there are some of the ... and things like that that they make\nIf you look into it in the parts catalog and they have a common sold
