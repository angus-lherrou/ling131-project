is Todd would he's a former air force pilot he's a national security correspondent for the Washington Times and the editor in chief of ... dot com down a lot of stuff I Want to talk to to talk about ... started here John\nWhat do you make of all the latest to fake bombs being found Clapper and I'm a Cory Booker what are your thoughts [noise]\nLook I always look at situations like this ah basically and try to find out who is the benefactor of of these actions and who who get something out of this and you know I heard the theories about who thin or China or you know something like that but I I really just believe that\nAt this point the people who are getting the most out of this are\nThe Democrats the marks on the left or whatever you want to call them a because one day it takes it takes the focus off the care of and coming up shores will America South America and it takes it takes to focus on and off the mob mentality that actually that\nGender are programmed by the European all the ads it but I had really been making a difference in the old it moves so they had to do something that's what I think\nNo it's it's you know I'm a firm believer in the concept of ... razor which is that the simplest explanation is usually the most correct one eye and so you know that certainly is the kids it's funny we got this tweet\nFrom a guy named Tim Garton Ash I Andrew my guess is that the bomber in the Bernie backer why else would they drag ... into this well Debbie was in charge of the DNC she got she\nI'm not going to use this word she messed up Sanders big time and it's interesting because Bernie Sanders seems to be the only Democrat who haven't gotten one of these one of these fake bombs are what are your thoughts\n[noise] oh that's an interesting point I hadn't thought of that but what I Do know is that within an hour or so of these bombs been started to be discovered you had in a written and edited and published op ed by Soros in the New York times\nThat tells me something right off the bat the other thing is that none of them exploded or you know they weren't real bombs I mean this ... this was a hoax it was trying to make conservatives looked evil violent which you know it was classic production by the Democrats they're the ones doing the violence\nBut let me talk to you let me let me let me circle back to this rush ... theory that that that you not only did Chuck Todd advance of this but I've been thinking about it because I got I got a background in these issues as well mom ... you know it's it's it's a situation in which we know that what ... wants to do is foment\nAs much to visit and chaos as possible in in American political circles this is what he wants to to do\nI mean given the fact that I Want to talk to you about your thoughts about America pulling out of the IMF treaty 'cause you've written about this given the fact that we pulled out of the IMF treaty last week\nA A N and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed on the ground in Syria isn't there even the barest possibility that this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the time he just to type for it to be that kind of an operation\nWell it is possible I mean what they just ... nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several\nPeople or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders for you know the vice president's et cetera of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point uh that's just my you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I I just don't believe that they would do that\nThis point in time let me ask you this because getting getting back to this item treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the UN starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and\nWhat do you mean by targeting maybe you can lose a day that's on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I ain't get talk so what is it what does that mean and and how ... what is what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that's exactly\nWhat you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threatened you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with the person who choose against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations and so when he means by targeting\nIs is really just putting the court in Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting a timeout tools that carry this\nTime I visit so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a I at Detroit there's literally he's talking about about change did you talk to coordinate\nOh for sure he he I mean what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before I mean this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia\nCan keep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThe you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot or he is a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the ... show page\nOn Facebook so go and check that out there explaining what's a little bit about what ... dot com is 'cause that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I\nHave a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I you know learned about the Soviet Union flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years focusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that\nThe west especially Americans in you know middle America I don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly\nThe traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I ought to know how to talk more about this because I was always a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learned the language are you at the very least I Need to rush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for people to talk to us but the pot a show dog on a show\nInstantly that this was the left are trying to change the narrative that had nothing to do with the Republicans at all I don't think the Republicans are or the or the or the light would even stooped to something like this study bombs I think that with the\nThe caravan the law that ... the capital effect I think the bishops coming up I really believe it I'm really happy to hear on your show today that uh that uh people started to question the other sources but even the left I really believe it was left after this I don't think most of us you\nKnow I mean listen it is as I said documentaries or suggest that the most likely explanation is the correct one and I'm a firm believer in that and and the reality is listening historically speaking\nIt has always been the ... the so called progressive the leftist the Marxist who have chosen to use bombs as their tactic for terror and this goes back up more than a hundred years I'm sure that if I had talked to taught about sort of the proto Marxist movements in America\nBack at the lake nineteenth early twentieth century you think about the various anarchist movement that were out there and the fact that they were quite literally the concept of bomb throwing a comes from that so it wasn't there but I I appreciate uh I I appreciate the call I Want to go to go on to go to Twitter real quick\nI as I said when you read I mean at Andrew underscore Langer on Twitter\nAnd as I said I Will read every tweet or even the most critical ones on this one from my patriot gal Andrew\nA good stuff but can you be a little excitable I'm trying to appeal myself off the ceiling listening to you I appreciate that pitcher dealt with I Am I Am just so thrilled to be you're sitting in for war today um so I I met excitement is going to come through and I listen to these are these are ... a heady issues these are important issues\nSo I tend to get a little excited talking about this I Will try to tone it down for you or or at least move a little bit further away from your radio so I'm not making you jump up on the feeling uh let's let's go to well let's go to Steve in Michigan Steve welcome to Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nHey I'm good how are you\nOn that day they

they're going to find that package you get ready to store it\nAnd post market and then when they grabbed that package and they see it\nThey'll immediately take that packet died of the party that get both by\nWell sure well that that certainly explains the one that was the the ones that were found in Florida the Cory Booker one certainly but in terms of the ones that were already at CNN went to George Soros and went to the Clinton et cetera et cetera those were delivered\nWell I guess that came through a sorting facility but at some point one at the point of entry they would have been pulled

I'm a child of immigrants but you gotta come away\nAnd and ... and we got this uh on on the Twitter line here I'm at Andrew underscores anger on Twitter from an imaginary Adam on Twitter the only bombs we should be talking about is the caravan bumped here's here's one reality right\nAnd again the the thing that makes America great one of the things that make makes America exceptional is that anybody can come here legally and become an American it is the beauty of who we are as a nation that being said\nBorder security is an essential aspect of sovereignty if you don't protect your borders you lose the essence\nStanley McChrystal General Stanley McChrystal not some you know right when bomb thrower was on CNN this morning talking about a ... he was asked about the Caribbean and one of the things that he said was that a a a up the border security is an essential aspect of sovereignty\nAnd your it's clear your constituents in your potential constituents get that why is it that but what is your opponents say about this I won't get away our power how would the Democrats in his district taking this\nSo my opponent Joe Cunningham rough the mayor of Los Angeles are SETI here to campaign wow do I need to go any\nFurther when you're really if you really don't I mean that that seems to you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a guard study from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\nWhere it's just that because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right yeah Democrats don't have a platform this year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had\nSomething good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we had the that the economy we had in generation no yeah the lowest them at birth and\nPeople don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe the Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic\nTo this country they are toxic they're all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be we should stand\nProud and strong had gather as a country\nMy side my desk to South Carolina state representative to the Arrington choose the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody will it's obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them because of um ah\nAh because of the other things that are in the news the suffix bomb story a and and we now have a a GDP at three point five percent of the third quarter\nOr President Obama when he was an office said we were never going to the GDP above two percent of the Trump McConnell you're turning that around\nObviously this is very important to other folks are talking to the seat it's in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets are how are they on those sort of the the Trump tax and regulatory agenda one of the same to you about that\nThey all love more money in our pockets Trump you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path we need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class\nGet permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focus on going into that shit\nBut other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area of bowling being wanted them shore and they just four hundred new people the parents no one likes to tear up no one likes to Tara\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that is inherent we need to remember that this is the world's best negotiator demand do his job you don't regulate it got\nNo no go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd using ... to let businesses thrive\nIs what we need to do I mean we government the fundamental belief and I'll give Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credited as long as he told me and it's part of like a Democrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republicans believe government is the problem\nAmy thanks for having me aboard and I'm One hundred percent on board with you guys you know what I mean it's it's\nReally it it just prefabricated at the different from what the real story happening and that's immigration immigration thing at the number one and it just to add all these guys that got these bombs strapped to them they are like\nI don't want to use the word enemy but they hate Trump bed every single one of them it benefits them to make this\nA good deterrent are different from what's\nReally happening short and\nIf you could imagine there's fourteen thousand people coming to the border we're going to need police I\nKnow let Gehry we're talking twenty thousand people probably the biggest things going to happen to imagine almost forty thousand people on the border you know what that's going to look like World War Z I I'm just saying\nIt is the biggest thing that's happening and their song spread there so I think this battle this argument is what they are losing\nWell and I appreciate that David lets them they they know the in the in the the the immigration issue boomerang against them it's a it's it you know Americans want border security which may want\nFolks to be able to come here legally they understand that it's what part of what makes America such an exceptional nation but that we need border security it's funny I'm reminded of the line\nFrom Inglourious Basterds about that ah when although the Apache says yeah we got a word for that\nThat kind of a coincidence we call that suspicious I Am I Am ... for the yes I I I find that very suspicious I find is suspicious\nThat Bernie Sanders a you know as if somehow not we're not caught up in all of this in fact ... you're right any reason not to speculate that somehow Bernie Sanders backers are making connections with the Russian government

really a roving mop I mean let's be honest this is a model trusts actors\nWho are hell bent on breaking and entering into our country something you would never tolerate in your home nor should you and not north shore American family tolerate this er into our home and so from a policy perspective a number one it's a threat to our sovereignty a direct threat that that they are marching waiting or blacks and\nDemanding that they become part of America not asking not respecting our process and our laws and try to legal immigrants which we log in this country a instead they're saying we're going to do with our way because we want\n'em in it that on the security threat it's a threat to our economic security obviously a course bore having millions of illegal workers flooding our workforce as we tolerate it for decades having people come in who aren't bad we don't know who they are and I say there's all sorts of fairness issue a you know ... like my father they go through a very lengthy\nProcess to become a legal Americans it's totally unfair and disrespectful to them to say the other people can cheat the system hop the line and\nBecome Americans however they decide to\nA quick it creates a very perverse incentives towards doing the right thing and then you're absolutely we had a ... a conversation with a caller a little while ago about that very issue the issue of of respect for those who did follow the rules and and those who are waiting in line right now I mean those were doing the right thing and waiting for\nCitizenship or their their permanent legal residents at us all of those things so that that's that's absolutely true and and so as we talk about this and again my guest is Steve Cortez a scene and political commentator president of the Trump Hispanic advisory council\nAs we talk about these issues are obviously we have the president he's talking about taking some action by executive order or what are your thoughts on this\nI was in I think that's a very good idea he can essentially use the same logic and legal framework at the travel ban against a those countries which are failed states for terrorism reasons\nOr we can apply that and it looks like that's going to happen to these countries and the main reason that's important is right now under US law is crazy but if a Mexican comes across illegally or he or she can be repatriated almost immediately but if you're not from a continuous countries shore um Central America that is not the case it's a crazy loophole that needs to be fixed\nUm but in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across\nA through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of the travel ban but I think ... here's the bigger point I don't want to have that confrontation less incentivized Mexico and find somebody else for me kind of Bratton threatened Mexico\nTo take care of this problem because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like it on this issue and they hadn't gladly pass the buck\nAllowed in the ... these care of it has to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them particularly a trade\nAs what happened I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration\nAnd you have a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continuous part is it's interesting you talk about this\nHe talking about the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know this highway that travel right along the border I Want to say five five I don't remember no San Francisco's north south I think it's high ten interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea that someone can simply walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me and I'm thinking as he was ...\n... ... of course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of a lawless for of course border here's the reality the president wasn't far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners or for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nAnd this isn't conspiracy theory nonsense isn't from some far right you know ... the Laredo station at the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred Bangladeshis\nAre crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what\nI'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic ...\nOr so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here from Bangladesh you know even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think it's very eye opening shore and tells us you know that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught\nUm so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for national security\nIt's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop this and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part we need to use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way that doesn't work\nIf it comes to it we will seal the border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get that trick pony in but I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight in the south of interstate panic goes right along the border in in Arizona and California um I guess the Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it it's funny because I I come back to you something to think about being a phobia and I I Want also make it very clear I said it's a little bit earlier on in the show\nBut the one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is in a central element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else will you go just about anywhere you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan in the same thing Korea the same thing\nI'm an independent voter and I'm a Republican this time around saying I voted for Rick Scott governor\nRick Scott a for Senate here in Florida and also a Republican for Congress as well and the region as an independent I Want to clear cut choice and two years\nIf Democrats have control of Congress or gridlock nothing will get done and that's not good for our country I Want to give the president a chance to ship all his policies workers they have on the economy and then in two years I could make an informed choice will whose policies work or wall there's an independent voter this is what I Want to go\nYou know this is good stuff for us and I I appreciate your calling me 'cause I got I got a tweet earlier and I actually want to go back to this up in the remaining time that we have a this was a good to just give me a second for me to pull this back up\nIt was kind of it was it was an interesting question that here we go a woman named Kathy wrote in early on to the show Andrew our representatives don't vote represented to what the voters actually want why can't the people's vote on the laws exactly the same way a presidential election as Ron we don't need the center of the house with as much as they get done OK\nCathy and the remaining a couple of minutes that I have ... years here this is the thing we need to have a a government of balanced powers\nRight ... and the worst thing to\nA Muslim I'm fond of saying regarding democracy democracies tools in a sheep deciding what to have for dinner\nOr you don't want that so so are our founding fathers created the system where we have two different houses of Congress that are balancing each other both in the way the members are uh are apportioned\nAnd in it used to be a originally in the way the members themselves were voted into office so there was a certain degree of accountability\nRight before we had the seventeenth amendments our senators were selected out of our state legislatures\nAnd to me there was a certain degree of accountability right now senators only have to really be accountable there comes to their constituencies in an election year they can go five years with virtually ignoring them whereas if they had to continue to report back to their legislatures\nTheir legislatures could hold them accountable to be recalled their legislatures could hold them accountable but we need to have this our our government was unless you're talking about vastly changing the size and scope of our government which is a possibility\nThen then it's just gets far too complicated for Americans to vote on every issue it was one of the same reason why we have lobbyist in Washington DC people can vote on everything all the time\nThey can't and therefore they need somebody to represent their interests and people coalesce around these special interest groups\nIn the remaining thirty seconds or so that I have I Want to thank the team here at the lower income show

I'm doing this fifty that's about all we know and that he was a man that he was arrested maybe an irrelevant back but he was arrested pretty close to Nancy Wasserman Schultz his office\nIn Florida\nThe let's continue to take calls with anything goes friday Jonathan from cottage grove Oregon Idaho cottage grove how you doing\nA great thank you for having me what's on your mind\nI haven't seen a lot of narrative on TV about um can we really blame Donald Trump for encouraging the uh the violence that now we're seeing and my question is can we can we will count I'm all for it is if we can hold him accountable for anything else\nI I hear I hear your question and appreciated there'll be clear the word blame is an interesting one in the law they talk about causation there tends to be two kinds of causation\nOne is button for causation wouldn't the thing that happened but for that other thing and then there was more like blame\nYou I you know any number of things some butterfly flaps its wings and ... for those flapping of those particular wings of that particular time any number of things might or might not have happened but you might not have the lame\nThe butterfly for it when it comes to Donald Trump and pipe bomb I'm not talking about either guide them lay\nIt is a required opportunity for us to talk about the discourse in the country and my note to play in this cut off at us symphony\nI mean it's I don't even get to stay into my note is that this isn't a both sides thing it's not about just a toxic dynamic but there is a toxic movement and that movement does incite violence or anything about this do other than he did a horrible thing and he might be walked in the head\nBut we do have to point more attention to the toxic movement that has taken over once proud political party and that is taking over the country and that is and we should be talking about that regardless of by Bob we've been talking about that because there's a lecture in ten days and the way you hold that accountable is not the thing that Donald Trump gave birth to that day\nHe is not the head of the snake as I said what I have had the privilege of being your hopefully favorite

wishing for\nTwo didn't goes friday morning show I'm Jeff Smith\nThe penultimate weekend of the twenty teen election defining congressional election of this century what are you doing tomorrow\nLet's take your calls Tim from Durham North Carolina Thanks for calling\nJim you there [noise] I Can't really\nUh thought about that I can hear you there go ahead\nOkay I just wanted to do I want to get your thoughts on a Newt Gingrich Helen are telling the reporters there that that the liberal type that uh has those bonds mail to ...\nUpon themselves but if they got out that\nShow the ...\nThe reason I Try to take attention away from Donald Trump is not only because he thrives on attention but also because I think it is my very nature distracting I Know it's not entirely the President's Day to to the merits and requires attention but I Want to blow something up I think Paul Krugman set it up pretty well this morning\nOr the or what he said well it's now we've now figured out or the right wing has figured out there talking points out and their talking points I include\nA no ... that the pop by pipe bombs were fake if I you know what I Want to do I want to get that video that Gingrich interview if we can because he went on at all and then I'll cite Paul Krugman and by the way if you have questions or thought you can also tweet us ... Smith or you can tweet at Tom Hartmann ah the show itself or\nThat in that in that interview pretty sure that same interview he was also asked\nAbout if Trump was going to be facing some heat\nIt and and investigations when\nDemocrats are elected or if Democrats were elected to Congress and he said Well Donald Trump's not afraid to he'd been sued all his life and not worried about it and yeah but if Democrats when Congress they'll they'll ah subpoenas tax records as well yeah and that would go to the courts and then we will see if the cabin off fight was worth it\n\nAnd then we will see if the Kavanaugh fight is worth it so thank you for that call because it reminds me about the Newt Gingrich a ... interview and and and when I talk about focusing on the movement and not just focusing on the figure head\nIn this movement now had instead of talking points talking point is everything but hey folks\nLet's not incite violence hey folks let's make sure we don't do humanize\nOur political opponents hey folks yeah you know what our president should be held accountable for inciting violence whether or not to do with the ... the guy is not the kind of thing we ought to do we probably shouldn't be chanting to try to get\nLocking locking up about political opponents that's not the kind of thing that we bought a revolution over I Know it was a long time ago it's not what we thought World War two oh I Know the veterans it up passing away and we're forgetting that legacy one of the reasons is that is happening is we're forgetting the lessons of the past\nBut we do have a movement that is failing to hold itself to account unless it's only objective is power\nAnd for that it holds itself to account and the only language that it will speak\nIs power if that is the case then the next best chance is Tuesday after next\nAnd your next best chance to do something is\nTomorrow or maybe even tonight with phone banks and canvases or maybe last minute donations donations today and tomorrow still can get ... and last minute that you have to make most of your TV adviser you can still boost your Internet advise you can't pay air by going to give your stat bigger bonuses you might if you win\nBut grassroots stuff on the ground last nine days matters\nA lot so yeah I did catch Gingrich and by that I mean I caught Gingrich\nBrad the builder grew Logan veiled Georgia go ahead\nIn

look like official government now\nKnow where you care off the edges to get your W cheese and things yeah except it's from the Republican\nNational Committee it is a green stripes on it it looks exactly the same color as my name and signature required on it just like it was certified mail\nExcept it says mining or current resident now open to that and trying to get me at this late date to sign up for absentee ballot it's\nGot all the information filled in for me on an absentee ballot form from the Republican National committee which if I send it in\nPossibly would get to read all men are\nI'm an election administrator in my county\nTime for her to put me down for one which would not\nBut you wouldn't have given them out entirely Carson right so I think you do to make sure\nTo let me make sure I understand he says he got you got to come in the mail looks like certified mail you open it up and it's encouraging you sign up for an absentee ballot and if you do to flee did it and sent it in it might work but then all of a sudden you wouldn't have said it in anti to actually get that ballot because by the time they even turn it around the election or to be over\nThe contract democracy no no no as long as you get the most votes\nAnd or control the most financial contributions\nYou get to be one of the side you mean like half half of the debate and people think I'm half ride and major media organizations will think my ideas are half okay as long as you control one of these two side yes you are half\nOf the debate we have most of the two arms and hands two legs to feed two hemispheres of our brains to is the smallest whole number bigger than one\nSo yes you get to be one of the sides\nBut now wait a minute what by appeal to Christian conservatives but then I nominate a serial full lander and multiple accused creep to the presidency do I still then I bought no no you're still yeah that still okay now what is the only way for me to keep\nPower is to manipulate the rules to redraw the lines to allow for ... unlimited secret money to win Congress to win the presidency without a majority what what if I knew that no no and again as long as the other side is a little bit of it too you'd definitely get to be still one of the side okay now\nWhat here's a big one but what if I get help from somebody who\nLike chamber commerce NRA\nNo no no like like a big advocate well the n._r._a. and we've had unprecedented frequency of horrific gun violence sure you can still no no I I don't mean them\nYou mean the people who want to erode the middle class in ... and may have more gaping wealth disparities you're worried that about you know that's that's a tradition in this country no no I don't mean them well who would all you're still one of the side but what if it's our biggest international ... what if I get help\nFrom that and it may be in cahoots with the murders dictator no it turns out you still get to be one of the sites\nThat would never happen\nI'm Sorry when they're tainted ocean there would never be a political system\nThere were never be a meeting about allow their institutions every voter is it could allow such an absurd\nHypothetical Donald\nAll the negative vote ... dot com from Los Angeles California what's up Donald ... the United states no okay go ahead\nNo as a matter of fact the apartment building I live in hardly anybody here will call me by my first name because\nFat I'm Serious people call me by my nickname I well I've got like about thirty different ways people Colorado what's your what's your what's your nickname middle name a well my my stage name is Dr ... the a K that's the most comment on our ah [laughter] All right Dr ahead\nAny rate okay so here's the thing you mentioned a little while ago democracy versus not democracy I'd like to introduce something a little more extreme than that demographer democracy versus the opposite of democracy because not isn't the opposite and involved\nIn the absence ...\nWhat's that yeah you're right it or not is just the absence that's fair\nExactly and in voting we have the same thing going on when people have a negative votes extension in other words when they want to vote against a specific candidate they basically given the choice or casting a positive vote or casting on non vote yeah\nAnd we should be allowing them casting negative vote if they have a negative voting change and there have been people who are writing anything is like against Hillary Clinton or not\nDonald Trump or an egg how would a negative ... helped me helped me a doc how would a negative vote work I see on my ballot and I just click no what happened that\nUm well it's not exactly know what the you know you didn't have for example instead of just having Donald Trump about what you would have for Donald Trump on the ballot and against Donald Trump on the ballot and\nAgain you would choose one just like you do now so if you choose against a candidate immune system we have no you would give up your option to choose to vote for a candidate you'd only get one or the other unless we change the system but\nNo that that dollar helpful or I should say doc the attorney voting systems although right now where I Want to harness attention is on the next nine days including what is happening to the six uh the uh what is happening on election day or\nThe but I think a conversation with the big sort politically I Do call polarization I don't see exactly polls a but with the big sort geographically with this big sort racially with the big sort ideologically\nA it is harder and harder to have a first pass the post system as constructed yield results I think working at the local level to transform mouse systems can work to broaden the conversation makes a lot of sense including voting systems that are kind of like approval voting which sounds like\nRelatively similar or may be exactly the same as what you're talking about where you can click yes on the baby alike and knowing that it you don't is one way of doing it in fact STAR voting is on the ballot right now in Eugene Oregon little town happened to me the town I went to college\nAnd it and at a at at that\nIn that system you'd actually Turley Yelp you'd give five stars to Kansas you really like to start or you didn't and then the one with the most stars would win or do we have another time for another phone call the uh let's take Rudy ah it beyond Donald Trump a lot of people think like him says Rudy from Atlanta Rudy go ahead hey\nMan I you know you you are really are doing a good job um you're you're you really yeah your legs max pitcher just say that we should\nUm yeah but uh you know Donald Trump is you know there's a lot of people that ... what's the word I like to use obnoxious just like him that think like there may have no regard for no one else has to be able to but they are and and and\nAnd you know you call it a movement I call the ideology it's higher up but I think like that\nYeah and and and on and on the rise and you got a guy that's that that's the president and and you know\nThose people are just attracted to that caller to coal but there are a lot of people that felt like there\nI mean I Do them in all ... and ... and ... and here's the thing you know over the holidays you we need to stop ... we have to find creative ways to confront these people are not found because every uh uh a group of\nRace of people have them in their family we have to stop you know just saying hey you know or you just being crazy or no ...\nUncle mailed ...\nCut that out we got to bring people back to the phone and start making the bank right because if we keep saying hey are they are sick they or they have a you know no it's it's time to stop saying that our love or are just crazy or they have from\nA Mayor Rudy let ... let me stay on the public to apply to this real quick to both of the things that you said so the first one which is ... is not just Trump it's a bunch of people and by the way that includes too many moments but me myself and my friend as a younger man\nAt it is it is not only a movement is not only a cold is also cultural reality in far too many lives to it and and and I and I totally agree with you and the second thing is I have been an editor to add to experiences shame on me for one of them not quite shame on me for the other one\nThe subsequent cover up a and everything else that's been abhorrent about the Saudi reaction to this is going to prompt a major rethink of this alliance in Washington I think ... or comments suggest otherwise that uh you know we're not just going to hype or over hype or mistake the jobs impact about real relationship\nUh we are actually going to actively sort of talk up um what would happen if we dared question this and and we were mad as really seems to be implying a we'd be leaving a very very dangerous situation if we really thought this relationship I I'm an ear to ear these remarks but they don't bode well as to a possible sort of shift in policy here\nSo let me make sure I've got a I've got the he said he said correct so\nShort in the uh\nMad as has been viewed as maybe on the outs certainly in some conflict will jumbled and I think we have this mythology that there's well they were the good Trump people that will save us I that's not how I see the world I don't see a lot of facts and bear it up but you know somebody's posted it out in the op ed that\nTo to that a fact\nAnd and what you're saying is that Madison's comments were instead just saying the same old line of no no we need the Saudis because we need a bowl work in the middle east\nYeah and I wouldn't say you know um I I\nAgree with you that trying to draw some sort of\nLine I'm separating out the like rational good Trump figures and the unhinged bad ones is a little bit of a complicated task would I Would say and then maybe not one worth even engaging in what is I think there's something we can see pretty clearly is a difference\nIn the caliber of person who was brought into the administration early on when I think uh yeah I mean Trump's ah\nUm [laughter] baser instincts were still pretty clear to a lot of people but he hadn't done a whole lot of specific harm in office yet and I don't think he would get people like mad as\nTillerson Nikki Haley now I think those are people who are willing to take a bet on their careers um and that's probably why they some of the\nMove on to other things that I was listening to Nikki Haley at the U.N Security council or on Wednesday when they were hearing testimony about genocide in the andme are I mean she was giving these\nFrom John Adams about pesky facts and things like that and I said this is you when you're not going to find a new hire to the role of UN ambassador who no matter what the issue is going to go in front of the world and talk about how much\nThe U.S value facts I mean any replacement to her at this point is not going to be in her model and so I think the same is true of mad as even if it's a stretch to say that you know perhaps he's one of the good ones but the yeah I I Do think you\nAre a lot of that has a talent that came in a early on you you're just going to get different people now who who probably are okay with a short term stint in this administration and care less about rejoining I don't know serious foreign policy circles after their time in in in the White House\nAnd what do you think we we only got about forty seconds left but ah\nWhat do you think should happen ... impact me news ... news dot com how should the United states the reacting to Saudi Arabia\nIs a is mad as wrong or is the administration wrong that that that alliances important should we withdraw from the middle east because we've only made things worse or it's constructive engagement given are still need for oil or something we should be engaged in what do you think or if you just want to quote someone else feel for doing that\nOr the oil is five percent of our imports that not dying and Saudi Arabia is a huge purchase of her purse a producer of our military arms but overall you know engagement\nWith that country is still relatively low compared with others and I would say you can still is constructive engagement but not just be willing to do anything for your ally and let's see if those are those military trade as leverage on our side not the other way around the Vargas\nThanks so much when you have a good weekend [noise] we're gonna be right back it's not the weekend yet

I'm a very non scholastic approach you know science is there but you know anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for the matter but looking ahead you know I mean if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes is a big believer\nIn cryogenic yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I Wonder what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are [laughter]\nWell first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the Huck basically set off a I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they are the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I I get in the in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that hum\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know it in my book um the end of life of you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is out artificial intelligence robots the third it has to do with\nPrivacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said I mean there's ... I think you mentioned like ... one of the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still the hope that people have about\nPreserving their accent and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to opt load thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\nI think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about my book about the future but ... but the truth of it is that it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and move in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan must are being very very involved well you know he's involved and driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and go for the phone but he's also\nGot his finger in the whole neural net of business but says the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with my life and and then the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a a very fine fisherman net think of it I think of it as a fisherman that so you injected into the the brain cavity of mouth\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain and then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue\nBecomes one with the brain tissue and this ... has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nWe can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that Iran mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you can have a a wireless connection that that's even better\nBut one of those one of the things that you know on mosque foreseen is the day when with the with the use of one of these ... that\nWe can actually surf the Internet with our thought we don't need a Keeter word or anything like that so\nI think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memory or in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will are thought onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to\nBe like whoa [laughter] way way out there right and so it can easily easily\nA whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a of a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistically can run about\nThat tonight look we will I I think that's the way to go not cryogenic but I think ... is a kind of an old school\nNot saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know ... and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said too much but I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\n... that's not the end game for these things are and I think partly that's the scary peach because\nSaturday Night mostly clear still fairly breezy or early ... thirty eight\nSunday in abundance of sunshine I'd said back into the sixties Sunday night clear to partly cloudy load that down into the forties looking at you Monday's sunshine stays in the forecast ... near sixty two and then Monday Night cleared to parlay bloody lowest fall back to thirty six\nI'm a ... for news radio ...

reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book it's ah it's just great to the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThe net net space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by discussions of\nMorality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nThe about the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is whether that was due uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me a question\nWhether or not that something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end use for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\nYeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern a in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of back and we're talking about right now it no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know wouldn't never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help to treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there is a good way in\nCalifornia right as a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nWell that's a cost you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy and so a lot of the technology that that ... aims at improving our help Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of a society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick you know robots kind of rising up and revolt against humans and taking over the euro well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the wave this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm are marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking in the we're taking it as a behind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so and and I it's interesting when I talk about in the book\nDoes regular I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no using that kind of I mean really\n[laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nUh well I figured if the late night show so\nI Try and they're going to lay down on that one okay and then\nLeave but you know nevermind regular yeah I got to worry about my wife you know you got\nFive at the white you said why are but uh but uh but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually buying these or what they're calling bug out houses\n... ... they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape it is a serious thing I Hope some day I quote former Google engineers in a

military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there where you know write it get it get it you know so soap or soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I'm fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella going to take some of that load off with their own skeletons I I think that the\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that it'd be and I do I'm not I'm not being\nFacetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah from the you know and I and ... you know back to\nThat idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be a consequence free is that I think that that deal I get worried a little bit and maybe the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would Rob ... at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's Jeff by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want a until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then and evidently the new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting if you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n... and uh you know we're talking about enhancing fold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare could possibly go wrong\nAnd you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter]\nAnd yeah I Know and and now and and the ... group you know I quote him in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling\nSome of their stuff soon or using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not\nShould in other words do give them a complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago you were going to be now and another escalating arms race right\nYou know ... in some ways you know it is that I often I often think to myself you know ...\n... yeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we are just still the same you know all our fault in our ... and our weaknesses\nAre and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our ... and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor ...\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means you can't win a conventional war because you're over ... welcomed by the technology of the moment you go unconventional and you'd go gorilla end this creates more terrorism\nAnd so you know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean I Know that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to a gorilla her way out of them not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\n... and his weaknesses but but positive person gets whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter]\nThat's a fact one of those that you know those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those ... nightmare dream thing depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had\nA um a body that we've decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\nMm yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story\nFor some years now and I'm ... it began with a small number of scientists\nUm or who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nUh where they yeah they severed monkeys heads and then they re attached to it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so if they say is the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now emboldened by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy and Russia has been quoted frequently\n... who is a quadriplegic you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that\nGuinea pig and there are scientists who are her quoted as saying that they're going to do it so whereas once again you know river I'm I'm old enough to remember the\nFirst artificial heart transplant sure yeah\nThat uh the ... or ... ... what was his name Jobbik right or something like that and um everybody's cringed at all my way way putting them in the mechanical hard in a human being and the you know wasn't South Africa right and yet a duck and and as as and and you know\nNow artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on where even getting past the mechanical heart hey by the way you talk about things that you give me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California\nAnd Minnesota and you know I read that if like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you're right that the minute University of Minnesota too much for for his stomach flus yet a huge research you did it in our one it's a big school\nYou know no you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why it just gives me an article but anyway you have\nThree groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walk the face of the earth before they're called ...\n... they're sheep human and pick human ... so these are the creatures whose DNA has been it together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA picking a and they're creating these creatures\nBecause they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human heart for the purpose of transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom uh bought now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I got a book that if you\nPut too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me a gives me a little bit lighter ... do we really wanted to and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I caught one of the researchers and says yeah that's that's a real possibility so there's not like you know made up high in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful that possibility but they're doing this research against the wishes of the N I ate the national institutes of health\nWhich is the government is number one funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age this kind of very I'm a ... a you know forward thinking of funding organization and saying you know well

the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in what\nThe police found was that the woman was wearing the these woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the vet\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the U.S [noise] and then and then other things\nHappening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure\nThat the technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of an Internet of things\nThat are buying on every aspect of our life that can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh I you know you if you watch Netflix needed that they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nAre there that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than\nWe are well these gadgets\nAnd yeah and I liked killed a lot of them I mean I were an apple watch by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing they took it from the real life\nOh they do they always do ripped from Janine siblings do he up but that's where I mean I I think that you know\nI like to catch a killer is one thing they do listen to all good they got a killer because he was it the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems which I accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having\nThis humongous a database of face print 'em that they don't you cover in the yard\nAnd and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate to the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy raised with\nWhich raises the possibility that you and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database\nBut the facial recognition technology that they're using to idea to finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by A R I or a screen up\nOn a

that and that's the way they look at it that he was murdered and I don't think murder\nComes up a lot when we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out to you I don't

science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I Would put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\nYou know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing alot terrific tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happened to the body after we die called stiffed\n... or packing for Mars in which you talked to she tried to learn what we like to\nGo to Mars and all the things or what happened and she did just very ... you know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent Jimmy it a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm a very non scholastic approach it the sciences there but you know anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I was if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I have fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically ... ... ah I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic just concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\n... uh you know they're being the stories that are Walt Disney had his head a frozen and uh with the with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth a thought\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I did I get in the in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... thought if more likely that hum\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thought the memories are onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know it in my book um the end of life of you know what I deal with these four big topic areas are right\nThe first is the worldwide Web the second is out artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said I mean there's ... I think you mentioned like ... wants to the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still just hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us\nYou know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to opt load thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture\nAnd then put them into something else\nI think it's very real a year and I mean you know and and you indicated about my book being about future but the but the truth of it is that it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak English and labs all over the world\nI I tell for example the story of Ilan mosques are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net a business which has a a really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with mice in in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\n... really what amounts to a a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman that so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain and then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue so becomes one with a brain tissue and this ... has a lead electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosques foreseen is the day when with the with the use the one of these ...\nWe can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memories are encouraged them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will are thought onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter] way way out there right and so it could easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold out of a person's entire\nA lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic we can write\nAbout that tonight look I I think that's the way to go not\nCryogenic cryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nOr you know and so and I'm not going to try and see what you said she was going to I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism\nThat's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is different here but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say kill ya logically that's not the end game for these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because\nCrime is great but it it's more than that it's history and it just read from a guy who's been a long time tracking the story of America's most elusive serial killer\n... for Halloween weekend and you don't want to miss a coming up tomorrow night but what's um what's

what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by a discussion of\nMorality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\n... about the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like whether that was you're uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nA question whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate\nLet's see in huge for that um other than our own human vanity that we become more than\n... yeah I agree with you in and the I think in another concern ... uh in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of effect is we're talking about right now it no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive and um you know wouldn't never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's\nSay a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I Want to just pick that as an example there is a goodly alec poignant right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants are people who are have\nDegeneration and their eyesight going away\nWell that the cost you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of the technology that that ... that improving our help Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich ...\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of a society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elite or if you will I'm\nAble to uh to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robot and so I talk seriously about it in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often the pick you know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the year well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the wave technology shaping up right now\nIt for people who have been kind of different France\nDr um or marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know there's enough is enough I mean we're we're taking and we're taking another behind\nAnd and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so and and I it's\nInteresting and I talk about in the book\n... do you talk like that to the people in Salem no use in a kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter] uh well I figured if the late night shows I'd drink you're going to lay down on now I Know that if\nWe but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know they have to say what you said why are but uh\nBut I'm ... but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these or what they're calling bug out out ...\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape it is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executive or a ... and others\nA division of of Google right and then went to a group or and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but he recently applied to the our son was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence ...\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this\nLook if we continue in the trajectory we're now on ...\n... ... it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we did they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect a God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they will control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on his good side because God that this technology we're creating will run amok\n... and you know you you start thinking well okay so it's a little crazy this guy but I you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which\nIntelligence is it is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that the you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the\nGang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you know and there was no one's going to\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off of a you know the the goat champion and so\nIt's printed that writing is on the wall I mean it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing confrontations 'em but they're they're becoming more\nDoing things that we are we want to talk about being very good at ... well you know like you're there buttoned up my thing they're like you\nKnow pretty well but you know\nOne day they're general like he was for me to be even greater than are that the day of the singularity that for the day and all and ... when they will have the equipment IQ of you know ten\nThousand a hundred and twenty five so [noise]\nWell I think they did you think these are the two is\n... ... ... the equation is used in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right because like you won twenty five\nBut at the smarter machine and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that ... that average you know like using it a drop in point\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be like we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than [noise]\nRight than we would have possibly the magic\nNo out like that the ... the ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use that ... that you know but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process of creating our own conquer the\nCrazy with that the I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up coming up after the

the same thirty pounds weight gain that a an individual who is normal weight would have\nTo what is it healthy pregnancy it looked like for me\nAnd then monitoring through the pregnancy to make sure that we identify those individual to develop hypertension new hypertension during pregnancy or new diabetes during pregnancy\nAnd importantly and it slightly off topic but definitely related is individual who during their pregnancy women who during pregnancy develop hypertension or diabetes even if it goes away after they deliver are at higher risk for heart attack throughout their entire life\nAnd so that marks a woman who failed destruct stuffed up pregnancy and we need to watch or maybe they need to see a cardiologist maybe they need lifted lowering therapy or greater monitoring for their high blood pressure so pregnancy it's such an important time for women's health and babies health as well as her future heart health\nHow does pregnancy affect the heart\nTo a normal pregnancy are um the woman's blood volume increases I'm a by about a third so that means the heart has a lot of extra work\nUm blood pressure typically actually in a normal pregnancy goes down um think about the uterus where the baby it goes from a fit side um Oregon too big enough to have a nine pound baby and so women actually have this ability to make new blood vessels and ... which\nAt so when they prove that they can do that that's a pretty healthy thing\nIf they have a preterm birth or a baby that doesn't develop fully because they're placenta isn't healthy enough those are all markers of risk for that pregnancy but also future pregnancies and future heart disease in that women\nBased on the statistics that we talked about you suggested that maybe ... or something that we ought to be doing differently\n[noise] well I think that preconception planning is really good talking to one of the health risk but I had that I can correct before I even get pregnant medication semi on what medication joined I if I'm On medication is what should I switched to\nI think making sure that women recognize that heart disease that they are at risk for heart disease and so that they pay attention to symptoms I mean one of the areas and it it with a sizable number of the individuals who suffered a heart attack after um a birth in the study that was reference at the beginning of the segment\nUm had a condition called spontaneous coronary artery detection that's it's an area of interest of mine this happens in people with healthy hearts with healthy vessels with no cholesterol or anything it is I'm\nSo there's nothing to prevent it but you got to recognize the symptoms right away so you get in and get the appropriate treatment so multi level it's pre during and making sure that we address the issues that arise and then making sure that everyone on the team including the patient knows what the signs and symptoms are heart disease I think that's a great point\nBecause it's been a while it's been a while since I was pregnant but I only thing the only thing that I thought about before we got pregnant was to start taking folic acid\nThat was the only ... planning that we did it all and even at someone who's got some heart issues I didn't even think about heart health when it came to being one of the things I should be watching out for when I was pregnant exactly [laughter]\nSo the big issues are obesity and the increase in rates of diabetes and women having children when they're older would you suggest it but if you're thinking about having children maybe ought to think about it early on\nThat's great to say in theory the in general healthier pregnancy years are going to be in in a woman's twenties on the other hand the reality is um women find partners later or whatever so I Would say to that older woman the woman who had thirty or thirty five and coming into their first pregnancy\nIs that is even paying more attention that's also the age in which we're starting to see more risk factors at and so\nWould it probably be healthier to have pregnancy it\nWhich leads us to wear myth or a matter of fact more than one in three adult women has some form of cardiovascular disease Dr Hayes is that a matter of fact he would be a fact oh boy at the price for women when you talk about this absolutely yeah and in that\nIn that statistic we do include hypertension which is on on the rights and increases with the each year of age particularly in women after menopause for that that a great segue\nHa ha [laughter] mental pause and just one of those things that again like we said with childbirth or I didn't really consider what heart health white impact that might have on my pregnancy I wouldn't think about it about a mental pause relation but of course it is well it is probably it's\nBetter known honestly because we have as women age they they had gotten this boost perhaps the protection compared to men of about ten years they get about a ten year grades they present with high blood pressure and heart attacks on average about ten years later than men now there are some exceptions to that because women who are\nAre diabetic actually it eliminates all of that advantage but um for instance women's blood pressure tends to be lower than men up until about the age of ... around age fifty and then women\nBlood pressure starts going up men states high but it leveled off\nSo it is a time in life that is both a change related to changes in hormones\nInflamed gall bladder concluded problems at the bile duct that self tumors which can sometimes be cancer it's an even certain infections here did it got called latitude the Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist decker Brett Peterson welcome to the program Dr Peterson nice to meet you\nThank you very much it's a pleasure to be here with you\nCall it a little bit about the gall bladder where it is what it does\nWell the gall bladder is a recipient for ... coming out to deliver during periods of fasting\nAnd it expands and in the ... made by the liver which is being made all day long it's stored there and concentrate that a lot of water is sucked out of bile\nWhile it there so uh when you eat a meal the gall bladder squeezes a muscle at the bottom of the duct a relaxes and ... that's now very concentrated is expelled into the intestine\nTo mix with your food for the Justin what tilted to squeeze a there's a hormonal stimulus saddened when food and thought uh our company at the time of the meal the a and food arriving in the do it you know and it tells the squeeze\nThey'd do it either because that little portion coming right out of the stuff that's right that upper small intestine\nWhat do you do if you don't have the gall bladder because people have problems with it and it's removed than what did they do\nSo um the gall bladders the most the removal of the gall bladders the most common operation in America today it was ... and so we have had to say yes it's very very common to live without it all better perfectly healthy lives\nThe by all that important for our digestion then reside in part in the ... during fasting and in part it just a rest sin is president within the entire length of the small ball\nThe ... and it's in the small bottle is recycled by re absorption in the lower small bottle and it comes back through the bloodstream to the liver and goes through multiple cycles losing just a little bit with each cycle into the large intestine\nYou know it used to be when people would have the gall bladder I remember when I was a kid a there would be in the hospital for two weeks they would be a big into humor but the picture of Lyndon Baines Johnson showing his goal butter scar and it seems to me like people who had had their gall bladder I had to change their\nDiet but that's not true anymore is it not particularly no that's correct with digestion works fine with without the gold or the ... still active and still functioning the way it should\nThe major consequences long term of having your gall bladder out as a small proportion of patients develop a chronic diarrhea maybe two or three percent which is easily managed with agents that bind the ... that's spilling into the cold and\nSo it's the it's the bio in the colon that causes the diarrhea and ... and just a small percentage of people that\nAre in a small percentage of irritating and are stimulates or see a\nIt inhibits it irritates the color and inhibits absorption of fluids and the intestines so most folks or if they have a little bit of softening or it's a don't appreciate it as a as a major consequence but the small percentage has enough diarrhea to require some intervention but that's\nEasily managed in a modest issue\nWhat most commonly goes wrong with the gall bladder\nWealth most patients um who developed gallstones which are underline most problems in the gall bladder are already symptomatic in most stones don't cause problems\nIf we look at the entire population somewhere around five to eight percent of men will develop gallstones somewhere around ten to Fifteen Percent of women too about twice as often and women\nAnd eighty percent of those who do develop them are a symptomatic which sometimes find them unexpectedly when looking for other things but we just leave them alone and they do find\nSomewhere around twenty percent of patients will develop pain we called ... colic and this is a\nVery typical pain that comes on fairly abruptly over five to Fifteen minutes sticks around for a prolonged dinner of all of a half hour to several hours before resolving somewhat gradually so\nAbility or a colleague however can Enrique or if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention\nA small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious complications of college just die to swear at the pain for says the goal butter is very inflamed and removing it is um lateral elective and margins\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gold Jones when I was in medical school it would be male fat forty turtle now I don't know whether you can go say they're maybe they've changed the words but that still true\nThat still true [noise] women developed gallstones twice as often as men because of their ... estrogen and project and in the bloodstream\nWe know that a certain ethnic groups develop a gallstones much more often American Indians Native Americans or the probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high Caucasians below that and and African Americans are less than that even\nSo I'm uh ethnicity is important family history is very important probably a\nTwofold are threefold increase in likelihood of farming stones\nAre overweight states especially with the BMI over thirty the risk of gallstones is quite a bit higher\nUm and multiple others that are gradually less important fertility though the fertile part to having a pregnancy is a a high risk factor for developing stones or gall bladder sludge a precursor to stone\nA sludge often resolved after a pregnancy and stones tend to stick around so if someone's had multiple pregnancies their likelihood of stones as much higher\nHere it's mostly diagnosed because there's pain president would that would bring patient bend\nSo most gallstones probably go undiagnosed for 'em but the ... of\nPatients have all variety of symptoms that may or may not be related to stone and then they're usually fairly easily diagnosed by ultrasound so identification of stone's is generally straightforward except a small proportion of a tiny tiny stones um but then the\nTradition of symptoms to the stone says sometimes so much more difficult issue\nI can tell you that there are outliers than I Am one of the females that forty and fertile and none of them and I had my gallbladder out and that's a pain in the extreme\nThat in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar painted since I don't fit the bill ... blood or did they just took 'em a while to figure that out\nBut the good thing is you can take it out through the laparoscopic relatively simple straightforward surgery or in what overnight and really I didn't have to change my diet at all so that the surgery has absolutely remarkable are there other treatment options beside surgery\n[noise] [laughter] well other options have been developed over many many years but with the advent of laparoscopic approaches to surgery\nOr many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective in less than they are less effective uh themselves so ... is really the only realistic option for the patient who can undergo surgery is a surgical candidate\nAre about have similar read them and you're calling instead of smoked acted in the morning and that's why most people have about living in the morning what can be done to accentuate that

and\nMedication in general we'll usually start with\nAn over the counter lacks a tab such as just plain old magnesium salt can be very helpful but you can get over the counter and then we might talk about the occasional use if necessary have a stimulant lax it if like it's a coat on\nOr a ... and I'm a\nDepending on what somebody's needs are so we kind of step it up but the first thing I really like to get at in diet physical activity staying hydrated\nAnd if you don't certainly are uncomfortable but what can happen if you don't address on it comes to a patient\nYeah certainly you're uncomfortable and a lot of people experienced pain and bloating and sometimes even yeah an upper Shiites symptoms people who have reflux reflux symptoms can get worse if you come to a patient it

Mr\nTear down this wall\nShame just come to America and we got America great again\nWelcome to the very best part of our broadcast week I major ... corresponded to CBS News and creator and host of this most amazing program known as the takeout conversation about politics policy a little bit of pop culture always always built around a meal why\nBecause that's where people relax a little bit and we have some good times and we have a great conversation never edited I Want our audience understand that 'cause a lot of people coming to the show different formats CBS and\nRadio stations around the country on our podcast our guests are never edits we never have a post show conversation about oh that was out of context with is that the context as always exactly as it is just putting that out there where we did have peaked diner we've been here before where she kept her was our guest over here\nIt's a hunt a little kind of a very quaint fun little diner right on Capitol Hill our guest this week the air force secretary Heather Wilson there was a show on CBS you might have heard of it called Madam Secretary that's all kind of\nFable this is the actual Madam Secretary so Madam Secretary it's great to have you here at the ticket broadcasts microphones good afternoon or it's wonderful to be with you so we're going to get into some heavyweight issues are about the air force\nPresident Trump space for smoking but before we do that I Want to introduce you to our audience because you have a fascinating biography grew up in Keene New Hampshire your\nFather and grandfather both fascinated with an active in ab ... aviation knows a little bit about your background\nMy grandfather was a flyer in the first World War for the ... so he was one of the first started pilots and the first World War and then came to America after the war there was no work in Scotland and uh so he was an immigrant came to Boston and started flying in New England opening little airports and being a barn Stormer\nFlew in the second World War for the United states for his new country and uh and then my dad started flying when he was Thirteen and enlisted in the year ... yeah yeah\nHe traded his services as aligned boy for flight lessons yeah and then he and those are going to ride a bike around that time he's flying airplane he got his got his flying license on the sixteenth birthday wow so\nThen he uh he enlisted in the air force he's a crew chief so even though he was the maintenance guy and then when he got out of the service so that would have been after World War two before Korea um he uh he married my mom who is his high school sweetheart\nSo in the Nineteen fifty is when a lot of women didn't even drive he taught my mom had to fly and then after they rebuilt airplanes together and um my dad was a commercial pilot and I'm and I'm\nAgainst a merging industry yeah yeah I mean if you say okay let's flip through the plenty here it was just getting off the ground\nYeah All right but then when I was a junior in high school they open the air force academy to women and large apply\nThat was well it's a pretty big deal my my dad died when I was young but my grandfather is still alive so here's one of the guys who and growing up you were fascinated by ... by planes and and and really inspired by my my grandfather and my father's and my father's friends who\nAre you know some of my most fond childhood memories or that and in fact I still feel this way when I Walk into on a hanger the smell of an airplane hangar and the airplanes have a\nLot of the ... there was a smell of airplanes for and uh\nAnd it's one of the most ... smells in my life but as I said is the smell of a hanger\nSo you apply for and work except for the U.S air force the air force academy so I Will have youthful places in America by the way the Catholic or knocks me out I've been there two or three times\nI've often said when I feel like I'm walking around the campus it'd be like going to college on the top of the roof of the world you know the next time you go out have them take you up in a sail plane I went up ... I went up in a glider two weeks ago with one of the kidnapped\nTo just uh to just go over the academy area and have them teach me a little about what they're doing and it was gorgeous what was that experience like there could not have been very many other women conducts at the air force academy when you were there were there for him and I was in the third class to include women so to the senior still was an all male class when I arrived\nAnd about ten\n... ten and Fifteen Percent of the class where women so I graduated with about\nA there were maybe you know eight or nine hundred graduates in my class and about any of us were when I write and how was that experience for you overall well it was it was a great experience for me I mean it open doors for me that I never even knew were there I I I was the first person in my family to go to college which was a really big deal and\nAnd uh it was a Fulbright Scholarship um and it also\nI it it was a\nIt was a continuous exercise you know of mine that hostility to the fact that women were there at the shore I got I'm sure there were people didn't think that women should be there at the time women still were not allowed to fly combat aircraft there was still a law in place\nThat prohibited that until Nineteen Ninety One so so ah I'm delighted when did you see that as an extra burden or just something you were expecting going yeah I\nI didn't really no one ever told me that I couldn't do it you know so I grew up around people that just assume that you know you could do anything you could be anything you wanted to be and\nSo I never really encountered people who didn't think that I could do something until I got to the academy and then then you kind of look at him and think real what's wrong with your man can do\nThe ticket and you were a very successful could that graduated with honors wrote scholarship after that yeah variance in Oxford\nThat was wonderful I'm so I spent three years at Oxford I've I've got a masters in a PHD there and and uh it was a very different experience from the academy economy was like drinking from a fire hydrant\nConversation about the universe you'll ever enjoy oh my gosh uh so I'm going to play for you a soundbite from uh your ball us secretary of defense Jim Mattis this August thirteenth twenty Eighteen topic spaced forest Eli that's number one please\nI I was not a guess what I Would\nBefore we go we had to do a lot of work\nWant to be All right that's the defense secretary talking in general about the speed sports book Jim ... administrator knew the grass Tyson and said there is an issue that has to be reckoned with space is a hostile place their interest in equities United States has ... involved in our daily lives GPS all sorts of other things\nAnd yet I'm I Want to read something to you I'm sure you're familiar with this October force this month foreign policy I Will read the lead paragraph to\nUS President Donald Trump is peeved with air force secretary Heather Wilson over her handling of his directive to stand up a separate space force in the U.S military and he's considering ousting her after the midterm elections three sources with knowledge of the matter told foreign policy can you respond\nTo that well when when the White House denied it my husband was very disappointed [laughter]\nOkay why he was hoping hoping the terms it gives you back or as well yeah I have a a ...\nMore normal normal life yeah yeah no it let me talk about where we are on the space for a first of all I I I Am completely live with the president and he set out a very bold vision we have to do when he was white here's the problem that that the secretary Mattis talked about that we're trying to address the United states built\nA glass house in an era before the existence of stone in other words in space we we are the best in the rural states we're at our adversaries know it\nAnd they are seeking to develop the capability to deny and use that space in crisis or war\nSo think about what that means what we do in space today there's not a military mission that it's been in some way by space we have Seventy seven satellites\nOut a little less than half of them are GPS so the the blue dot on your phone is provided courtesy of about forty ... air force base in Colorado how the uh the timing signal for the New York stock exchange comes from those satellites we do communications we do whether\nIf you wait in ten years\nAge thirty five and started doing the same thing it would be a little less than seven hundred thousand so less than half as much because you had waited ten years to start saving and I think it was Einstein who said that compound and just as the eighth wonder of the world and we would so our great\nWithout yeah you know we all know that\nCompound interest is our friend in that it can basically help accelerate growth but I find that you know as it is the way with a lot of conventional wisdom or things that we know we ought to be doing it doesn't mean that people are going to behavioral standpoint necessarily do it then I think sometimes\nIt's worth asking the question why not you know if you go to any body or you know who's early in their career and starting to work or whatever it might be and tell them that you know you really ought to be saving more right now because the impact of time\nWill basically do so much of the heavy lifting for you pretty much everybody would say yeah I Know that he had it still seems like so many people don't do it and I think sometimes we get in our own way you know from a psychological standpoint so you know oftentimes when you had somebody who is newly entering the workforce or let's just say maybe just out of\nTrade school or high school or college or whatever it might be I think it's so easy to take the long view perspective and so people often say well you know I'm just getting ... waited you know I'll start saving in the future once I have a little bit more money and I'm a little bit more established 'cause I have a long time until I'm going to plan to use this money\nBut they often don't realize exactly what you just said to add that even waiting five years or ten years dramatically changes what he grows to win the impact of the overall plan itself\nYou know sometimes rather than waiting until you have what you feel like is a sufficient amount to start saving it's better just to start the behavior save something even if it seems like it's not that much\nBecause just by setting that foundation and having some of those dollars have a longer time period to be able to accumulating grow that in of itself can really compound the overall effectiveness of what it is that you're trying to do from saving standpoint anyway it exactly right\nAnd you know if you're I mean just think about it this way or if you're going to work at a new job and then you're going to be making ... ... dollars a month as your gross income and they're going to be saving five percent of that\nNo that's only two hundred dollars a month such or saving us it's not going to make that much difference in your lifestyle but the difference it makes it later on because of compound interest on all their savings are extraordinary\nYeah I completely agree and and even sometimes on the back and we see people that are closer towards retirement and sometimes they feel like well since they haven't lived you know a million or two million or whatever it is\nThat there's no point they might as well just kinda take what they have in you know be as aggressive as possible because they feel like it's you know a Hail Mary to begin with\nBut I think no matter where you are in your state Egypt saving or building or your career it's always a matter of just apply improvement with them and just trying to take a real element of where you are and figure out the best steps forward regardless of any of that\nSo it had earlier you were talking about compound interest and you mentioned the Roth IRA ... um you know I think that oftentimes depending on how you're looking at it whether you're looking at current tax filing future tax filings if you're looking at the long term planning standpoint versus\nYou know wouldn't accountant might look at you know today is probably a lot of conflicting information out there as far as whether people should do pre tax or after tax savings but what's your feeling what are your thoughts in terms of\nYou know what people ought to be saving into even from a vehicle standpoint the whole\nIdea of saving into an IRA or a four O. one K. if you're an employer plan that sure enough for and taxes on 'til later in the idea being that let's say and then sure enough\nTwenty eight percent tax bracket why are working and then when you retire you wouldn't be at a lower tax brackets now anyone and get out of their tax rates are going to be lower forty years from now than they are\nLiquidate never sell out of a position to capture gains than in since you're missing half of the process of what it takes to really accumulate and build well you know one of the things that really comes to mind in terms of another just kind of practical\nEast that people often don't think about is I heard somebody say one that it's really important to understand the difference between an asset and a liability in what you're willing to do to acquire each\nAnd most people listening probably say will everybody knows the difference between an asset an ability cause an asset is going to be things like you know an investment accounting liability is death that loan but\nReally what they were trying to say is that if you think about from a behavioral standpoint the way that people use money\nThat people really don't think twice about going into debt to buy depreciating assets cars a furniture appliances closed or whatever it might be\nWhere you buy this thing you charge it so what you pay for it is maybe twice the cost of what the sticker causes\nBut as soon as you buy it and take it home it drops in value by thirty forty fifty percent in ... and he was really making the point that people do this all day long not realizing that they're really shooting themselves in the foot but that people are often scared\nTo leverage themselves or to borrow money to acquire a NASA\nAnd I was thinking about that and I was just thinking that was really true you know you can talk to somebody about borrowing money to buy a piece of investment real estate\nAnd a lot of people are going to be somewhat squeamish because that just seems really big I think the people but they're okay you know borrowing money on frivolous stuff that has no real value and what he was really saying is that you know for people to shop\nThey really ought to shop for after not for a liability in that if people can buy assets and use the past of cash flow off the asset to buy the liability then they get the liability but they keep the asset also\n[noise] you know interestingly I was\nFairly recently and I had never heard anyone say those performed but we weren't talking about\nBudgeting as kind of figuring out what you need in your life from what's really important how to decide whether or not to buy things or not\nAnd the gentleman said and I have never heard those for for his son\nYou really have to pay such close attention now to what are truly need and what are simply want [noise] and he said my dad always used to say water is a need hot water has a lot\nAnd I thought wow what a what a great way of putting that on prospect for people [laughter]\nYeah I I think that's so true in in part of it you know not to just blanket and lay blame society but so much of it is driven from all the things that we have I was watching a football game the other night\nAnd literally every commercial with the car commercial\nWhich is okay but we noticed as we were watching these commercials how much of marketing and just how much of of\nThings that Dr our economy are really based in you know for lack of a better word you know just call it lost and I'm not talking about like sexual this idea of people just having to have it you know the ... there there was a Toyota commercial [laughter] out with people\nYou know singing that love song the cars and just the passion in their eyes and everything like I just had to have the car and if I can have it like I'm just not going to be able to live my gosh it created this ... this this mindset for so many of us that the things that are out there to be bought\nReally are things that we have to have we all sometimes feel like if we don't have like our life is going to be diminished in and we're going to be at a loss and you get it from a marketing standpoint because these corporations are trying to sell their product\nAnd how many times a day was it the style as long as I Know about how many times a day because of the Internet because of social media and anything that we click onto we are barada just with marketing every single day of our lives\nFor their everywhere from television and radio and and as I said social media and our phones that are high pounds on at our computers and everything it's just constantly marketing and advertising and weren't just barrage all day long with I don't know probably helps feed those the whole\nConcept of materialism and I I Need that\nKnowing him so far I Want to have\nYou know what else to do from star\nYeah I really wholeheartedly agree with that you know and I think because we predominantly work with people who are retired we have the benefit of seen\nThe real life implications when people don't take that to hurt people trying to figure out now that they want to retire what it is that they can do to right the ship I'm reminded of of a couple\nWe've probably been working with for years now but ah you know there is like this lifestyle they were trying to keep multiple houses or at least a very expensive house that they were trying to hold onto in in a sense\nThat almost desire to you and I don't know what to call it was almost like a connection between what it meant to them like their own intrinsic feeling of themselves to have this lifestyle that\nThey were kind of just used to living even though their situation changed and they can no longer really afford it\nAnd I just remember what it was like for them literally not really having a big chance of being able to retire I mean they just simply the numbers weren't working but over the course of years\nThey made changes to a lot of stuff they had and I don't think they gave up a lot in terms of lifestyle they did something more reasonable from the housing standpoint they made some other changes also and it probably made a world of difference for\nThem well and I I think she will\nWith me it's up to with many of their entire herbs pre retirement class suburb Oregon where we can tell and a matter of men out as they start talking about their\nWe can tell how much money they have based on on the way their hands trans some questions or the way they are talking about things and so often um people who are let's say sixty sixty five years old\nMoney's fairly easy to master but a lot of people that money being a mouse germs out until after\nBeing absolutely absolutely one hundred and fifty percent you know people often talk about a\nCompound gross but I think there's another concept out there that people don't often think about which is compound income so here's an idea a lot of the times I think sometimes we approach retirement planning backwards meaning that\nWe sit down with somebody and we'd say how old are you you know how long do you want to work and then based off when they want to retire we're filling in the gap and say well you need to save X amount\nAt such and such growth rate to be able to retire at the state but by doing it that way we're almost prolonging how long the point of financial independence tape because if somebody says I Want to retire at age sixty five and I need to save five thousand a year to be able to get their assuming seven percent then\nThey're studying that as a goal to say well now I'm On track\nBut I think one of the things we can often think about is that everybody's goal shouldn't be necessarily save a certain dollar amount issue literally be to replace their income as quickly as possible\nTo generate enough passive income\nTo replace the earned income or you know not necessarily the salary but they're expensive so my salary maybe ten thousand amongst my expenses maybe six thousand a month but my goal is to generate six thousand a month and path of income as quickly as humanly possible now because I'm going to retire then but I Want to reach that point of financial independence as quickly as possible\nFor some people you know that might be the tenure process for Fifteen or twenty or ... whatever it is is what it is\nBut you know instead of always trying to invest for growth in compounding grows sometimes it does make sense to invest for income and use income to buy more income to accelerate how quickly you can develop income and I think they're kind of comes back into another rule called the law of conversion\nIn which somebody is really just trying to continually upgrade their assets you know I have asked that\nEssay and maybe it's worth fifty thousand but I'm trying to turn that fifty thousand dollar at it into an asset worth Seventy five thousand and keep converting into better and better at that but I don't think people often think that way in terms of investing for income or trying to generate income I think they tend to think in terms of\nSome dollar value that they later that are going to try to convert into income\nAnd again back to what we frequently repeats of people during our seminars\nPreterm it really is all about him call him to no longer about the assets that you have\nA towel my going to turn this into usable income for myself when the paycheck stop and again when the paycheck stop\nTo Social Security I guess you could call that a pay check if you can get some Social Security benefits and perhaps you have a pension other than that no one's going to be paying you anymore because you're not working or something so you have to create your own pay check\nAnd then that's going to come from your house outside man retirements truly is all about making those assets worked for you so you can have the uncommitted\nLime light want and need absolutely I'm\nTrying to create that income so that it's consistent predictable unreliable you know so that you're not always gassing Raul this is going to work out and in keeping your eyes kind of focused on the past when you really could be more for it looking\nSo proud of either to listen to and if you have any questions about anything that we've talked about today or just want some additional information on some of these topics we always reserve some time throughout the week royal listeners feel free to give us a call\nAt uh eight for for three four five\nThree one for zero end and wrapping up tab you mentioned something when we were getting ready to start doing the show\nWhich is something that you also kind of highlighted briefly during the show which is about people not understanding the\nThe difference between what a need and want is you know I think one of the most practical things that we can say and and granted we understand everybody's situation is different and sometimes it may not be immediately able to be done but the ideas that people really oftentimes do live above their means they\nKnew him and we were we were laughing a little because it's so true in someone's so good all allowed but just this whole attitude that\nYou know I I think we all know people who they they simply have to have the latest shoes on the latest fashion and they have to drive the car they can go to the school and counted up all about about about about because it's like you're so concerned about what other people think about you\nAnd once the expression in your twenties you're worried about what everyone thinks about you in her forties you're not so sure you care about what everybody thinks about true and in your sixties realize they weren't thinking about the first place [laughter]\nSo being a little a status Contra seven and a little more\nPractical yeah I think it's so true because in the end you know when people reflect back on their lives\nThey don't even remember the shoe that they couldn't get right only remember the car they wanted that they didn't have a new it typically is about the practical experiences and the people in their lives are at meaning what they're doing\nAll the time we have for the show today\nBut tune in

time for the U.S there or what can they do\nYeah I think we've got to be very humble about what we can do I think a negotiated settlement will be the outcome at some point and and hopefully that

them as being a corrupt or wrong but I but I Do think we need to be realistic about what to cheaper but\nNow let's talk about your book you profile leaders and they're not all from the same page Walt Disney Robert he leaves Martin Luther king junior or all subjects in this book are so different though what do you think they have in common\nWhile I think they all at some point we're viewed as leaders meeting they got people to do things or they cause things that happen in some cases they founded companies in some cases they were political leaders and other cases religious reformation in every case they were able to bring people to move in a direction\nAnd often using very different qualities and skills\nIs that how you define a leader being able to motivate people\nI think that is actually too simplistic I think a leader actually is some\nA person that emerges from interaction between a leader and follow words a minute that unique context of a situation\nAnd from that you get this leadership that comes out almost like a chemical reaction the leader is part of that equation part of that process but I don't think the leaders necessarily the dominant part of it over we tend to want to think of it that way\nDo you think most of the folks that you profile in your book set out to be leaders or is it part of a chemical reaction to that question that you talked about\nI think it's part of the chemical reaction if we take out Albert Einstein for instance he was a brilliant says he says he became leader partially because of his credibility in science partially because he had

[laughter] that could bring guards greenhouse dot com a pretty simple um and that takes us in the first question coming back here we're we're in a mid to late October as uh we do the show\nA there's still time to get your bulbs in the ground\nOh yeah now is a good time to plant because the ground is getting cooler and so they can wrote in and it won't ah there'll be cold enough that if they won't want to sprout and tried to come up right away\nYeah there's a it's a I found it very interesting article uh when I was researching this um ad a website called garden myths\nAnd this guy I've seen other stuff he's written and I and I like what he does a and he wrote an article about spring bombs when is the best time to plan he makes the argument that the earlier you get 'em in the ground\nThe the better the root system er and his argument is that the plants are not going to bloom on you you don't have to worry that it's going to\nUh get so far advanced that it's going to a bloom and then you lose the bloom for the spring and his argument is that the bigger the root system the better the plant\nOr have you ... what what's your experience with that damn\nWell sometimes if you do play 'em too early they do start to come up\nI've seen it happen on occasion but there's a difference between will call up and they'll say that they're tulip or something is starting to break the ground you know it gets bumped gone failures you're on the first of September and sometimes people will buy it and they say well I better just planted right right away while I got to time and it's warm out\nAnd they stick 'em in the ground and the thing starts corrupt and then it starts to actually girl right right but the point I don't believe in planning to early\n... well okay ah his point is that it's not going to bloom he might pop above the ground and as we all know we ... we see these bombs pop above the ground in February and then they sit there sometimes for two months before they actually finish\nThe process and blue and I and I get the feeling that that's what he's saying is that\nBetter that you you encourage the roots I'm just saying I'm just telling you about this guy says and if folks want to read the article go to my website Mike nobody dot net\nA and it's called spring bombs when is the best time to plant I also have some bald information from Illinois extension\nFrom better homes and gardens from Michigan State university you can take a look at a\nUh all of those articles that you want to to if you're new to this if you're a novice to figure it out and if you're not a novice to refresh yourself on the show at any rate that's the point though a as we started is that right now there's still plenty of time to get stuff in the ground\nYeah there is one involved that does come up always in the in the fall and that's the most ... are great pie soon yeah and it will produce foliage in the fall but that's normal for that plant and that's actually kind of one thing about ... doing that is it's a good marker plant yeah if you put from Askari an where you have\nA bunch of balls than you were when you find more bombs you know the ... planted in that area because you'll see the foliage coming up\nYeah that's why I like it or when when I see them as scary I go to things well it's small [laughter] 'cause here comes Mr Khouri foliage and also oh yeah that's where that ... and if you plant and if you plant other Bob's around and then you get a sense of where they are too\nSo yeah that's a good thing or so we've talked depth we've talked time a time of the year we've talked a well ... obviously you want something that's large in from right\nYeah yeah you want a good ... volt\n\nThey shouldn't be softer machinery or break apart\nYeah uh and uh you know a lot as a lot of us know say for instance you're you're getting a daffodils um when you buy Daffodil bald especially if you're picking them out one at a time if there's a\nA a ball bill or a ball black\nHowever whatever phrase you use that's attached to it that's probably going to bloom too so you gotta ... you've got to separate one but they'll only charge you for one if they're attached which right so it's like a bonus so you can look for those as well right\nYeah that that's called double knows ball and it's basically like you said to Bob's stashed together and once they get to that stage devolve is quite mature and it's really going to perform very well\nAt least a single ball was are often a little bit younger and so that they will they will probably produce a flower but they won't be as refused for a couple of years\nSo if you have a ball but it's got the ball but should you separate those implantable but separately or just put them on the same home\nI I tend to leave them together because uh one will feed off of the other the the younger ball will feed off of the older bald angel mature butter that doesn't have to struggle on its own so I I always leaving together\nOkay what if you have some older belt how can you tell if they're still viable\n... well what do you mean in the ground\nYou know and that's not even plant last later when did you didn't plan to one's even from from a um a nursery or or um something somebody or\nWarm like over fifty degrees over the course of the winter time like in their bag or something ... most likely has gone dry out or they could only hold out for so long because really they're adapted to living in moist in in the soil\nAnd fill when they're in a bag they're not protected by the soil anymore so they started losing moisture mhm and then they can either dry out or they can actually start her on\nA show usually the balls they're kept that don't get planted in the fall are not very good to a candidate to plant in the spring\nWe talked about is like a couple of weeks ago about ... left over in the garage or wherever or the basement\nOr and folks will say well what should I Do wait till the ... you know I missed the season I wait till next season and our answer was no get them in some soil right away because even leaving even if they don't bloom this year they'll get some nourishment uh\nUm and uh we're running some commercials on it and and they're basically testimonials but they're because they're true or and for the last couple of years as I mentioned in in one of those spots um I have people say to me when I start harvesting my tomatoes\nWho you know what kind of Sunday you have you have different sun in your yard that I have in mind because your tomatoes are growing so fast and they ripen so soon I there's two things at work there one is happy ... the other is the tomato\nI'm rolling which is the garden Jim Wright from Dr Harry Klee at the University of Florida are you familiar with Dr ...\nI'm not\nOK yeah you've got to get you got to go to Dr Harry Klee at the University of Florida um if I think it's a what's the or the Facebook garden Jim I think I\nThink so and and garden treasures the other one that I agree with\nThat well they also yeah yeah and they have different ... in fact in fact they are going to be marketed\nA next year by I'm when I'm blanking um proven winning proven winters yes ah yeah which is an interesting thing because proven winters is going out with the Trump area and going into some vegetables including Dr Harry Cleeves tomatoes but as I was saying the two things that happen our\nI get my tomatoes growing indoors under the happy leaf grow lights and it's been fantastic and so by the time we put them outside they're fully mature plants\nAnd they're ready to rock which means I don't have to to cheat and try to get 'em in may when I Know the grounds going to be cold in Chicago when uh the air is going to be cold as I tell folks in this area and now it's different in different in other areas I say\nWait till June first there's no point taking a chance to um I don't well I don't know if you feel that way BJ\nI Do a you know I I think you can really do that by pushing it too early 'cause you're going to really slow I think you can plow\nOr development by trying to push up too early yeah you're right\nSo one of the other things that I'm using a light for and I'm hoping you can address it's a little bit too is a tropical that I brought in from the outside I now have under the lights on my front porch\nBut it kind of as a general rule as a rule of thumb how long would you leave if you're growing under lights indoors how long would you leave a mine typically for house plants and tropical\nUm you know for house plants I not have a lot of them that are growing in myself I leave lights on for sixteen hours a day for me they go on a ship in the morning and they come off the ... um\nWhich is usually pretty standard and good for most sporadic some plans for longer well off plans have the rest in the winter anyway I'm I'm actually going to try and push the envelope and get that to be a little less than sixteen over the winter\nYeah one of the plants that I'm thinking of a [laughter] if my album Cato or which\nI re plants I re planted at this uh summer headed out doors it it went nuts took off the problem is I bring it in for the winter and it's so it's all winter and then it has to regain its strength through him back out I'm thinking you know what\nMaybe I Need to put a happy leave girl light a over that and see what happens drama and ... yeah so and that's\nThe difference it makes because mine looks so sad when I called upon the spring and take me a little while to make money and the cover but I'm so much easier and saw a much better their high quality all winter long life so I don't\nSo what is it about the lights that is so different from say a shop like fluorescent light that traditionally has been used\nWell what the happy leisurely days they're delivering exactly the wavelengths that the parents need to grow happily um and it's got both threatened the blue light spectrum for both vegetative and flowering grow so I've got everything you need all in one light\n'em and it's extremely specific to the wavelength that plan actually you I'm so their their global\nVoltage they cost almost nothing around um\n... that's one of the most amazing parts is how little voltage a use the just the power is just amazingly efficient\nIt it it really is I I I'm really blown away by a man you got to try him to believe it but I think writing is one of the things that people it's the least understood piece of growing I think people know plants need light\nBut exactly what's happening with that light is something I think a lot of people understand so\nA lot of that get solved with the happy\nAll right well we're going to see you on the third of November at uh the McHenry

kid of of maybe eight or something like that or at a tan and and he killed his sister yes to start the movie so\nIt really laid oil the groundwork for a good I'm going to say at least a half hour of the movie before it started rolling into\nThis horrifying situation right and it started slowly too because then you see the little kid in class that Laurie is going to babysit and you see this on the president a man with a mask oh standing around remember standing\nAround these issues like by the window and you saw him like we're the all the laundry was hung which I thought it was a ... effect out out through the window downstairs outside\nYou saw that the sheets blowing in the wind and then all of a sudden you see the figure just standing there yeah and then and it would scare you like literally almost out of your seat and then the turnaround it'd be gone you know that sort of thing\nAnd the the music or ... so well John cooperatives director wrote all the\nMusic for the movie wow and they did it in such a way or they would do this this this flash like they did in in cyclists can imitate it but it's really all of a sudden it sound which is something you know and and you'd you'd you'd look and he's got there anymore\nOr or he would get you know he would get up after being shot at something and they get up for like down to take it they didn't\nDo yeah W. E. like sit up straight like automatically added oh it was so weird scary about the under tickets\nStole it from from Halloween by the way yeah I'm sure [laughter] um but it was it was just and it was a rollercoaster and then on television\nWhen the kids are watching TV to making popcorn they're playing for bitten planet if you remember I don't remember this an airplane they also played the thing the original thing would be for real health I remember that we made it by the way yeah the Nineteen fifties ... on that's from gun smoke and\nUh and they those two movies in different scenes we're playing at in the background or background we're when Lori was you know babysitting though is it gave you the sense of normalcy and I would be like this than I Would do this if I was babysitting at whatever she is Seventeen years old or a kid in high school you know like\nA so he put you there you really related\nTo these people and that's when it started to turn around and when someone died you cared about\nThem dying on some level\nRight it wasn't just a group of teenagers that you know you'd never met before and suddenly you know we're all being eliminated one by one\nExactly so that's a that's a little piece of it now and I play a little piece of very short of my one of my scariest movies of all time besides olive green or that I play once in a while for Halloween\nBack having to get to Barbara even\nCalling for you [noise] look because one of them now [noise] or is that\nFrom the you know oh neither the living dead which is a ... yeah I think I had I didn't appreciate it when I first saw cuts it had been out obviously for years and years and years and um I appreciated it later for some reason which is not so like the first time I was like nothing but after that I got it\n... we saw this one with a friend of ours Gary ... my dad and my brother twelve o'clock midnight oh wow the Hicksville movie theater used to play these movies at like midnight we first ... eleven o'clock they played a Young Frankenstein so it it came on the screen at twelve thirty and off it too\nAnd we were horrified walking really are hell wow will clock\nGive it a while but yeah [laughter] and I do and that it\nIt was unbelievable uh the experience again at sixteen and Seventeen to that's that's part of it you know you've yeah there is more you're still young yeah so that was cool I Know what are your favorites and other clipboard it is the ring or the most recent one which one\nAfter watching The Exorcist which I Believe I saw believe it or not the day after the junior prom with like a bunch of people including a prom\nDates that was a little odd was either I don't think you are there now that on um it was a rather odd already been blown up by my prom gate I was on my own if you if you're in the fetal position in your bed at the time or one of the many times that\nNobody was it was I don't know how to describe that now holds up a little bit but back in the day we weren't as gory in the movies as we are now right when when you saw her head spin around we use our vomit and so forth we sort of things are heard that things that she was saying in a different voices\nIt was extraordinarily horrifying and back in the day in the late seventies that was the most horrifying movie of all time maybe a ... dead which I think this is certainly more horrifying\nIt was it it it was first of all technically you know the way it was directed and the technology they use with much better than not living dead but the things I think it still holds that that spoke factor of you watch it today on a you know relatively night side screen with the full sound effects or it it's still scary yeah absolutely\nI Would say is that Halloween again establish characters you liked I'm not so sure that you liked cared liked so much the\nLittle girl and the mom you did like him but I Know I did not ratify a much you know I agree yeah we had that little little smidgen missing that factor and further didn't have any references to a star trek good to ah to to leave shattered all three why am I saying that\nI'm trying to work in the fact that uh do you know what the mask is that the original mask that friday\nI mean I was saying that Michael Meyers was using now wearing there was\nNo ... William Shatner Captain Kirk mask kid out of Syria Syria I'm just remembering it now they they play with the hair and they open up the pilots we're hearing more but it will hurt mass from the Nineteen seventies yes wow now learn something new every Wilder\nYou're\nWelcome back to where the older do again this is Douglas of the anti with David Corn and we're talking about Halloween Halloween movies were inspired by the brand new Halloween to eat team which is out now which I think is pretty good it might be worth a view how about some movies that\nHave been advertised and ... and and promoted\nAnd as if the greatest movie in the planet and all of the worst\nHorror movies of all time that it causes plan nine from outer space we did a whole show on that watching that as if it were mystery science fiction theater three thousand ourselves so you go back and check that out and everything all this new again dot ... everything old is new again dot biz up\nBut that was it of course a horrendous movie from Edward in Nineteen fifty eight were tore a the the the ball the wrestler and his Bela Lugosi his last movie and it was just I mean I have you seen that movie all the way through\nButter yeah sure I mean it was a few times have you seen it with anyone yeah [laughter] yeah they ... it's more fun to watch it with someone of your comments and so for\nThem to make your own comments it was it was just horrifying we'd bad other any others that have come to mind to you that are horrible\nHorrible movies that you would not suggest watching\nAnd for whatever reason during Halloween well yeah uh there are few they back oh Twenty years ago\nTried to remake psycho and that was a complete disaster it's like they do they tried to duplicate the whole movie in color instead of in black and white and the first question that comes to mind is\nWhy would you try to remake a classic especially by Alfred Hitchcock so right away it's going to pale in comparison pale in comparison even though it shot and color\nAnd I am the only thing I Would say about that is or add to that is the exact same script\nExact same camera angles they tried to imitate the exact same movie like there was no creativity into creating something different at all in fact if you see cycle too which is not offered his caulk and was like made something like Fifteen to Eighteen years later I remember\nThat I feel pretty good I wasn't bad but this one I go to the minds of these people who who actually say yes to this idea I ain't hatred in that one right which is crazy she's I mean you'd think she would look at this and go what are you guys doing\nWell and Haitian were crazy do going to say I think that's a [laughter] for many reasons and I think for choosing this is is one and I listen\nI think it came about in the time where people trying to colorized old black and white movies and I think they said rather than colorized psycho let's just make the thing all over again it'll be fine will will do exactly the same and how\nDo you get it everyone is iconic everyone's seen the reason why would you want to see the exact same thing over again exactly makes makes ... how about one\nThat I think you know you might\nWatch for a minute and then say what am I doing robot monster have you heard of this no Nineteen fifty three\nIs a guy in a gorilla suit hay and a diving helmet on his head [laughter]\nOne of those old diving helmets like from twenty thousand leagues I say that and say\nHe's a robot monster it's like a real it's a strange thing and this robot it's sent to earth to uh to destroy earth and and he managed to do so all of the people on er the destroyed by him except for five and he says but as the rest of the movie chasing down these five people\nYou didn't see it or who knows what I mean you see you know clearly see what he did it in Arizona they're down to five survivors and out of the movie star to erect a and he's got a ray gun that looks like a kid's toy it's just\nA you need any one of those especially in Nineteen fifty three that I that was a weapon of choice the Reagan on that one sounds like a good movie for and I haven't done it yet

just reading the the description called the creeping terror from Nineteen sixty four just to give you the\nThe background on it that they lost all of the audio they shot the movie and apparently somehow they lost all the audio so all they have with the visual film\nAnd they didn't have enough money to apparently like hire the actors ... job over the the film so they just had some people do it in post production [laughter] and and not only that it doesn't think up necessarily to the what you're seeing so it was just as\nBad over the above the voices not totally sync up and and it sounds like you're the monster you were just describing it's like this guy if the Chinese dragon but at the person\nAnd walking around in what looks like like this really dirty grimy sleeping bag and that's that's the monster and um yeah apparently it's on a lot of lists says like the worst horror movie of all time the creeping terror and look forward in a a Netflix or something like\nThat will be one of those ones where you go through with it would be Netflix or any of the pay services and and you know the rent certain movies will direct TV and you know and that will be the ones for free\nYou know

was ... he was also known for he directed\nUm that play 'em on Broadway or with\nThat one play they did a roadway that time [noise] so there's you're saying there's a star trek where's the star\nTrek side that he did some trick the motion picture he directed it there and there's nothing about Star Trek dive dove in ruined the franchise almost killed the franchise so he is a horrifying figure\nWith that in ... was the star trek movie he directed also a horror movie ... it turned out to be a horror for every science fiction and Star Trek fan and why was that why why was that so horrible why did he mess up like\nThat well um he he really didn't know anything about Star Trek he called the ... uh uh pistols and and you know guns and he he thought ah he didn't recognize the cerebral nature\nOf what it was and he didn't know how to move a movie or science fiction movie along he ... he was in the world of developing special effects we allowed special effects to dominate the movie ... hand all

sort of like the all the jokes coming out of basically saying this is taking on ice [laughter]\nKind of those kind of looked like that it's it's a very standard Liam Neeson movie where a guy who's been wrong somebody whose family had been killed he needs to avenge a loved one and it goes after me just happened to be a snowplow drivers in this movie I don't know why that sounds so absurd mainly because snowplow drivers seems like it would be the most\nRelatively mundane job I mean you'll be on the same stretch of road and you're doing the same thing it almost seems like a stretch but apparently this is actually based on a foreign film and that that has a certain amount of notoriety\nOr but I think of course we give me some have that special set of skills that I think it's going to do him well and it's moving so this was like it's going to be run of the ... coming out in early February which is when most of his movies come out usually January or February those are when these revenge action movies\nTend to do that just for this segment I Need to go to a break when it come back we're going to be talking about hunter killer Johnny English strikes again and I read those\n\n\nI'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy either dad of sick\nNo what's now booming I'll give you the clean version\nSituation normal all fouled up\nThe situation is very normal this happens all the time usually I let the stuff for all off my back\nI live in Columbus ohio I live in the heartland flyover country I Am not in one of the biggest market out there I'm not in New York or LA or Chicago I'm not even Cleveland Cleveland gets more screenings and I do\nAnd it is not uncommon for studios to not screened everything in my market and little sometimes be huge movie like this I remember the first draft of the world they didn't screening Columbus I had to go to Cincinnati to see it\nFor big movies like that I I Will sometimes do that but it's always irks me if they don't screen it at my local market and we have a big university here there's no reason to not screened things in Columbus there's actually a reason why we ranked lower and it's sort of\nA stupid mathematical reason but\nThey'll sometimes not screened stuff and I let that go but sometimes there are movies that I ask you about and this is this is one that gets me upset and why then go on the radio unreal on that when the movie like hunter killer I couldn't find a screening for it I asked the rap I literally email the rap and I'm like hey\nAre you a screening and Johnny English\nAnywhere near Columbus and he said no sorry we're not\nWell then I found out that they did now I understand that there is not the budget to screen something I don't think they screen Johnny English anywhere here but\nThey did scream hunter killer the fact that they had a screening was actually kind of hidden from the press and that really said something to me when you actually greener movie you're showing a movie early but you refused to let perhaps in\nDream [noise]\n\nAnd they can see a weather center finished that can be partly sunny weather hides in the mid ... well the reason that that gossip is anytime out power what about the last thirty eight degrees by the name was not the ...\nWell I've got thirty miles per hour they said they would see plenty of time with the highest

they can they can\nMake he's able to be mostly sunny once again with the highest in the wind in for ... well that that will lower the degree that partly cloudy can they can\nAnd meteorologists corny than in for a new radio casualty a T O T H is sixty one degrees [noise]\nAnd welcome back to back guys at the movies with Kevin garlic continue on with the movie reviews [noise] first one is fried solo ambitious mountain climber plans his greatest yet to scale el Capitan without the eight or ropes or safety here\nIt feel different to be up there without a real reviewing what her car because\nAbout ... I mean they're like oh he's totally safe [noise]\nAnd then people who really know exactly what he's doing\nI've thought about for years and every year and I'm like that's really scary [noise]\nI'll never be compound Matthias ... putting you ever\nThe water [noise]\nThirty two hundred and ...\nThis was a documentary and I I have to address the fact that as I'm Talking about this\nOr we just had actually to hikers die in Yosemite\nFrom going to the edge of a cliff there's a lookout out there and there's no railing that kind of the point of it is that\nIf the look out in there to hike or that have fallen to their deaths just this weekend so this movie's about rock climbing and it's about mountain climbing and it's about scaling el Capitan than with out the aid them any sort of safety here\nSo we have a real pragmatic thing happening in the world today in in America today were two people died just being at the top of a mountain so this is dangerous\nAnd this shouldn't you know I I it's awkward to talk about this movie where a guy doing this great feat of bravery when people have have died and it does make the question of how much is a safety should that be a concern of the parks\nBecause on one hand you don't want people falling through their debt but on the other hand you don't want railings just obstructing the view all throughout the national park\nThe point is is that when people go to these parks that need to err on the side of caution they need to know what they're doing and you shouldn't be walking out too far you should know the train and and you could die I remember my wife and I am an on our honeymoon\nWe were in Hawaii and we're on volcanoes national park now I don't know what it's like now because that was over Twenty years ago that we had our honeymoon but I remember going up to kill away\nAnd you can't get to kill a way because it was at the time at least it was actively erupting\nBut it was a slow steady eruption and it was going into the sea you could drive up to where the lava stopped on the road and you could see in the distance especially with like duck so you can see the red glow of the lava you can see the steam coming off the ocean\nAnd you could walk out on the the the the lava or the rocks that had of course from a previous corruption and you can hide out there but you're like a couple of miles away\nBut we walked out onto the rocks we didn't come anywhere close to where the actual level is going on but there's you know you can put up signs but people are going to ignore thing\nAnd I I think that that just brings up a good issue in terms of pre solo\nIs you ... if people want to do these things you shouldn't stop them\nEven if you made by doing that\nAnd a free so there was an interesting movie 'cause I I showed it to my father who is like an addiction and he was\nHe had nothing like I Would never do that because he's not a risk taker but it it shows a certain breed of person that will take these kind of rent it reminds me a little over the movie sunshine Superman that came out a couple of years ago and it was about daredevil was about a guy who ended up dying doing these daredevil things these BASE jumping stunts\nAnd those are those ... those people exist and if they want to do it and that's how they live their lives and they they should know now if they should if they sue because they said oh you let me scale like happy town and I am and he I fell or whatever\nYou should know not the scale of Capitan and if you do scale ... especially free solo you should realize that you could very realistically called your that\nAnd that's one of the things they point out in the documentary they just don't it's not just the chronicle of the guy climbing a mountain\nIt's about his life is about what brought him there it's about other things he's done how he's kind of a celebrity in the climbing world it's about him having a girlfriend and the girlfriend is Monica girlfriend she's very attractive and she seems very sweet\nBut it seems like she wants something out of him that he's not going to be able to deliver she doesn't want them climbing is you don't want to doing the dangerous stuff it's okay to lie but\nThey even make a point in the trailer in in the movie where they say anyone who's made free climbing a major part of their life has died they eventually have a bad day\nAnd that's the reality of I have a bad day and I go to a screening and the movie is bad or that sound doesn't work right or like when I saw a Mission Impossible the projection was terrible this summer and that affected my ... that's the worst thing is going to happen it's disappointing\nYou don't have a bad day or the ... mountain climber or a rock climber and you slip and you don't do it perfectly you could nominate a thousand feet on the rocks and die and that that that that that danger is really a parents in the documentary\nNot to it's a really well done documentary and it's got beautiful imagery and and it's it's harrowing to watch this on screen\nI bet it is somewhat you know standard documentary or somebody trying to do a feat but I like this one better than say something like\nMan on the wire which was the guy reflecting on him doing it this is all leading up to three talking about I'm getting ready to do this I'm going to do that you you must you know the story you don't know whether it makes it or not and that was my big problem with men on wire when that movie came out about ten years ago ...\nWell the guy is doing and interviewing while you know he didn't fall from the world Trade Center 'cause he's giving an interview and the two thousands about\nSo free solo was an interesting movie it's absolutely worth seeing for the daredevil nature and the and the ... and the composition of a film a and and also to look into what kind of a person a lot of these sort of things and and and kind of what makes them tick\nSo I'm going to have to say they're free so low rocks well actually\nYou're listening to fat guy that the movie with Kevin car the next one I Want to hit really quickly in the fog but this is getting a limited re released in theaters this week and part of it's because of John Carpenter by you know what it's been a\nThirty eight years since this movie came out\nSo they're uh they're giving a re release and you're getting some theatrical play in that so I thought it was a good time to take a look back on John carpenter's the fog this Nineteen eighty thrillers about that sailors returning to other seaside village a hundred years after they were betrayed and it comes back to the theaters this Halloween\nA lot more alert or [noise]\n... a time watching and I love I watch it all the time it's out available on new Blu ray totally worth checking out so uh so yeah I'm going to have to say creature totally wrong well actually\nMean the fact guys at the movies with Kevin car let's talk about the next one I Want to hit really quickly and that is maximum overdrive Stephen King takes a stab at directing its adaptation of his story truck about people trapped in a truck stop when machines become self aware and animated\nMy name is Stephen King [noise]\nI've written several motion pictures but I Want to tell you about a movie called maximum overdrive\nThe deck and they're going on around a lot of people I've directed Stephen King novels and histories and [noise] and I finally decided if you want something done right and you ought to do it yourself [noise]\nI don't know now if you remember early in the box office round up the segment\nI was talking about the danger of expecting movies to make too much money one of the interesting thing that happened in the eighties is while you had big Stephen King movie like Kerry and the shining\nThese were big Stephen King movie which all got a whole bunch of really small ones do you know don't rent it bought up a bunch of the right and he made these small crappy movies that had a very small budget\nBut the they helped make Stephen King a household name because while you had the big one no good middle one coup Joe but you also stuff like cats I in in in ... show or or maximum overdrive these are movies\nThat may not have even been good but it got even kings naming the trailers and then the theater's so much that you became a household name just outside of books\nAnd maximum overdrive was his chance to do or don't fill\nAnd it's funny because I was watching it a couple of years ago and I put on Twitter I said I'm watching this movie is directed by Stephen King somebody wrote back and said\nDude cocaine directed that movie and then a lot of ways that is true Steven King was on drugs when he made this movie he will admit it or he's cleaned up since but yeah he was on drugs is is the eighties he was at the height of his career you give a lot of money that somebody who was an addictive personality you're going to get the\nMaximum overdrive is an absolute disaster film it is a terrible movie Stephen King has no idea what he's doing he doesn't know how to direct you can see him having fun but not really knowing what to do it sort of like if you give\nSomebody a basketball but Don explain the rules and just tell them to shoot the basket and they have to cut even figure out that the ball has to go in the basket and that kind of the way it is watching this movie it's not well made it's not well plotted it's not well written\nAnd the that the opening I remember watching this trailer in the theaters thinking it was so cool was like I Want to scare and he's like pointing at the screen and he's doing it the whole thing\nBut now it just looks absurd because it was such a bad movie and it didn't do well but\nIt's also a glorious Lee bad movie it's fun to make fun of and there's also some amazing stuff in there just a music element to this movie AC DC did the soundtrack to this which is amazing now some of 'em are existing songs\nBut you know use is he making a huge rock and roll fan and he had a relationship with the CDC and yeah they got the ... that's the music and\nThat kind of amazing because the movies so crappy and small yet one of the biggest rock bands and history to the music other interesting musical no to the ocean that trailer the music for that comes from Halloween three seasons of the which another one of my favorite ironic\nSilly movies from the eighties that's fantastic because it actually works better in maximum overdrive than it does in the Halloween franchise so there's some gems and that's not a meal or worse than it did terrible acting and some of the line in moments of this movie or just goofy you're going to get out\nBut boy if maximum overdrive isn't fun to watch maybe if you are saying that to to to get in the state of mind Stephen King was when he was directing that's because somebody may lose and I like the cinematographer\nBut it might be fun with a few adult beverages and some junk food that's that's the kind of movie to watch especially if you kind of have that in the south during the ... it's just\nSuch a bizarre movie to look at it in retrospect\nSo I'm gonna have to say that maximum overdrive still isn't a great movie but I'm gonna have to say a cat or rocks just for the fun ages aspect of\nOf rock that's up for this week I Need to go when it come back next week I'm going to be talking about the nutcracker and the poor realm and until then have a happy Halloween and fat time at the movie [noise]\n... here I Am who to list some turn items each in my left hand the

Peters and spend a lot of money\n[noise] um boy there's six years old [noise]\nYes [noise] and the kids are twenty is they're they're they're terrific kids you have no idea I Wish all kids look up to ... well I'm so blessed [laughter] you know what just because I had a great upbringing you know\nI Try I don't know I said I Believe that I Do believe that um [noise] All right here's deal uh there's really not a lot\nYou can do because the six year old processor especially with today's video streaming and programs and games and everything else that they might be doing is still a six year old profits or write\nA guy and the good news as there is any good news is that the next week\nOr on the thirtieth ... of October I mentioned briefly during the news segment at the beginning of this\nHour in talk yeah is that apple is set to release a Mac will care for okay they say under a thousand dollars\nBut you know the prices and you know yes in fact I think our urgent [noise] yeah I Know I hate when people do that it's like under a thousand dollars are about to say yes it's nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars right\nA little tough so you know in\nYour other options that you look at refer a and so if you go over to apple dot com and you have to actually ... to the bottom of the page crack and then there's an option and the second comment says refurbished and clearance\nIs that you I think you might be able to start looking and you know you look this weekend but you know as more people are buying the newer stuff they're going to be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever may be and so what I like with you by refer ... for Apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was the Mac book released and then if the screen has to be replaced they do that at all so still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nSo you still have that but it's still going to be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen hundred bucks\nOh she living it let me ask you a question I talked to a guy at will the apple stores here a little while back and he was talking about putting a ss ... drive in or something\nYeah I mean it sounds they dress like that yeah that would help you know what are the kids complaining about\n[noise] uh everything [laughter] so the whole of things\nI guess the the young mostly the speed and uh uh my daughter's constantly asking me to ... uh what's what's what's making us do this this I don't know that much about computers so but I just do they're always complaining about a ... and there's just not much I can do\nWhat you know which which you could do is you can buy a brand new windows\nLaptop\nAnd you know you could get a decent one for four hundred bucks\nAnd you buy two of them you're an for eight hundred yeah and\nThen I I Know I I Know what you're thinking if 'cause it's almost like\nYou know it's almost like you're telling the kids that they're going to start wearing wrangler jeans you know like oh that's\nA show well they matter of fact my dad's all in the bottom to the to the ...\nAnd uh [noise] uh he passed away last year at Ninety five and I think you had a lot to do with their brain caused the retired lieutenant colonel in the military a while a you know they just load of debt they spend a lot of time with him\nBut uh yeah they they started out you know on the top of the Mac\n[laughter] actually I have I have the other [laughter] yes as you know that's what they want to keep the\nToaster and you know and that's that's what they want to do and I get that but\nYou know there's really [noise] [noise] I Wish that there was some way that you could I mean you can do go find me they you know you could ask her family members and friends to to contribute some money that way but you know here looking at him and if people\nReally want a Mac and you know\nThere there really aren't a lot of options for you to acquire that Mac without spending a lot of money that you may start seeing the movement in use Macs next week because there's a new one started hitting the market place that may be a good time to pick up an older model\nOf but I think at this point if you don't have unfortunately twenty two hundred bucks to spend twenty five hundred bucks to spend on two new max or even to the to refer max than your only option at that point is to start looking at a really good windows based a\nLaptop that you can pick up as I mentioned like four or five hundred bucks sorry I didn't have better news for your ... thanks for your call today\nAll right let's talk about how you're sleeping because let me tell you something\nEveryone knows that sleep is so important you always feel better right after you have a good night's rest you wake up in the morning you're like OK I'm good to go and even throughout the day you still feel good because you're not drag and maybe at three o'clock you're like\nI'm older is titled the tennis well we've got four TVs and I think if we had an indoor and then we got that one for each one like yes\nUm and I was they'd been doing so much advertising that I'm I'm a big baseball fan and watching the playoffs at the all the advertisements rather than political courts have been um have been about YouTube TV and I was wondering what\nWhat the difference might be between acquiring YouTube versus kind of a streaming service\nAnd there's tons of them right get so confusing you're like what the heck should I which should I'd sign up for all right so\nI Know that a real cool you got little ... that falling in love or money and then got chrome gas to fire oh I'm so what's the baseball team you like ...\nOf course we knew that though to for to ah to talk to us about the best dreaming\nA sports strict gadget we have to go to the expert and we don't have a lot of money here just to let you know lord small business so what we're going to talk to Andrew yes hello Andrew Hi Jim [laughter]\nSo I I was a screening Laurie and we talked before she went on air and I after you know what's the most 'cause when you're looking at those services just find the one the smallest channel and see who's got it so he needs the Big Ten network that's only on YouTube direct TV Now\nAnd so the big network as a victim network is a rare channel so those are going to be three options to start with to see the brewers that's Fox Sports regional pretty much everybody's got to deal with the Fox sports ... regional channels you're gonna find them everywhere so do you want ... baseball and big time sports you are going to be YouTube Hulu or direct TV Now\nSee that and I told you Laurie I coach and he knows exactly what I mean I don't know he's like a walking sports streaming encyclopedia I've never seen anything like this in my entire life Andrew\nI'm going to give you a Ronald Reagan Laurie so happy look at the she's the woman said she finally knows how to get\nYeah because I have two teenage boys who are updating their [laughter] video game um X. box and and whatnot and\nThen my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and that and I have another one that has an eye pad and he likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just\nI'm frustrated so I was wondering if a we boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked at and you plug it into one of the house and plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work for us\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um\nIt's all it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay and so it's amplifying the signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent cellular coverage is that you can buy the booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay [noise]\nUh and it does it by amplifying the connection with them in a certain area around you okay\nA kitchen so that's not going to help you um [noise]\nI assume that this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh teach\nWhat you do what she 'cause you know it's you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through fish you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean\nThe right then uh there's always satellite\nAnd yeah we should try well we've heard our neighbors to gripe about it yeah\nIf you don't want especially when you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or doesn't work very well it also crawls um have you looked into a DSL line\nAnd that comes from a company correct because we've called our uh TV company and\nIs Bactrim\nYes well cats back them an charter and nobody will come down our road and all them since two thousand four part um\nI just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from Kaye\nIs it a friend of mine recently purchased a home in North of ... there's probably going to be the day but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise] and so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you have like this stretch of road where there's nothing\nFrom the mid nineties to them in two thousand Ninety seven as a starting point for a crow is it you know they looked at the end of two thousand five two thousand seven then or an ... where it ends as you're talking\nAbout okay right so generate millennials or anyone to Ninety six ...\nAnd the millennials were the ones that were responding to this thing in mind that old than a generation already has moved past all of my technology when one person responded with a tree ... I'm a billion years old and they were probably thirty [laughter] gee now I'm not I'm all in\nMy ... year I was born in Nineteen eight I'm not one either [laughter] maybe three but but he and my son is a gym there\nRight okay but he would know how to burn a CD because of who his mom is yeah and and that as we've we've made in the eighties and he's been down in the studio and things like that but then\nIt may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and guaranteed generations ears are not going to understand or ever use correct one of the first thing that I think would be it is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now is television commercials\nMy son watches everything on your trip right he doesn't know what cable television it it's all you too but then we hook up the ... and we're gonna watch Sunday Night Football\nAnd it goes to commercial things like what's going on here so we just kept coming up for that\nYou know what that's the problem I mean I mean because you're you're absolutely right\nBecause in and you know where he has never really had to see a commercial or if he doesn't see a commercial that only Fifteen seconds yes it's one of their little half minute commercial there's the skipped right once he watches five seconds of it right\nI'm Sorry about that when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there going how do you fast forward [noise]\nAnd when she and my father is but she doesn't pay don't have that here they don't have a WPN and you can't skip the commercial I'm like oh my gosh how are they living what is going on but stay with us it was just a convenience that's nice let's\nLook to DVR something and skip the commercials for the younger generation it's an given another thing I don't understand about my son is he'll say I want to watch a movie and you know renting it is I bet we have a sixty five inch television in our living I'm not bragging it's huge\nHe doesn't want to watch it he wants to in his lap and his hand on a small little why it's so interesting to me\nAnd you know what though that it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies and how they're using it\nVersus how you might you might want bigger I mean I'm a huge TV and I see those eighty five insurance but they have a ... drew it over the now in generation okay they are they're not really watching YouTube anymore or do you do yeah uh how are they getting their entertainment that\nVideos on Instagram Snapchat\nBut you're not going to find out what was your\nProgram there are they you know what they he watch all of his friends were watching some boxing match on YouTube okay so if it than event\nThey'll go to YouTube yet but if it's you know no longer they sharing viral video and I think we've talked about this for like each channel having its own app and so with my my my ... my inlaws have cable so they'd given my son their passwords so he can look at the Disney Channel and stuff like that on his lap\nHe has no interest he doesn't want to Bob around from ... now so I don't I mean these companies issues companies are coming out with their own apps but it's not going to work\nWell you know and speaking of television member Saturday morning cartoons oh of course it was the bad I Know I wasn't I mean I just remember being a kid\nSaturday morning in common you sit in front of the time and I'm like and I would have my bowl of cereal\nAnd the night before when the new TV only come out like right when school started in September the night before they head of the previous show and they would preview all the new commercials that were going to I mean the new cartoons that were going to happen ... that was the bass what was your favorite ...\nReally I loved I'm Tom and Jerry I'm your favor I did and and the road runner those roles cool it did but then there's also a mighty mouse heckle in Jekyll\nAnd um ... which was funded have okay the other thing that they don't know about it at the pet rock\nWhen did the pet rock okay it was a phenomena\nWhere this guy had a rock he got rocks and he put it in a box any soldier the rock which just rock just rock like a normal rock yeah nothing special right and he's told you the rock and the guy made like two million dollars\nSelling rocks Sunni buying a box with a rock and yeah so I'm waiting for the punch line there though there was a total fat\nOkay you know as a matter of fact when I ... and I even tell a story that when I was trying to syndicated show I called this guy CPS his name is Frank Murphy Hi Frank and casual listening and Frank told me that that a show about computers in the Internet would never work because it was going to be a fad a fad\nLike the pet rock and I'll never forget that 'cause he said it's like a pet products or my iPhone is just about rock sitting in my pocket speaking of the phone wouldn't last time you used a pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore or I saw them in Great Britain\nOkay summer no I I've been a long time and so I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booths were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just stand there like being towards like Hi okay and end bust out laughing\nAnd I said what are you laughing at okay behind me there were always naked women painting like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers they found a use for the phone booths exactly which is also the phone book\nBut isn't that something that's crazy yeah the phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change and now we just fast forward and when when did the iPhone come out and years ago two thousand seven\nTen years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone\nOkay did you have an Atari twenty two hundred yeah how we're all generations of video games game boys yes how to game boy say good CD you get this generation than anything about that no cars on their parents' phone if they don't know anything about a road atlas\nLike a map map yeah no no that that's good right yeah\nOkay I've never I never learned how to fold up her mouth and I I don't think I'm gonna\nTry now okay America Online now you know I started the computer section at AOL usually yeah years and years ago you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disk into cereal box you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right\nThere because how they did that behind the scenes\nAnd that and I I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says we'll find out Tuesday [laughter] that with AOL is that if you\nGave a desk sometimes you'd make ten dollars if that person that is that person use your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while\n[noise] oh really and then it's she's going to have to crawl her way back up if in fact she ever get to the top again\nKay uh because a lot of times when you start signing up for this is that these likes or what have you it's going to come from one particular part of the world and that's a part of a country that maybe you've never heard of in in the eastern bloc right\nOr it could be happening as someplace that are China subways out of India and then\nThen you just you become persona non grata in that her business is going to go it's going to just it's going to be\nGone [noise] so so I wouldn't do it\nIf you're trying to ... you know I mean if you're trying to grow the business that I Would look at you know doing a contest okay\nYou know a look at some type of promotion you know like this photo we've been doing this on our Instagram account you know like this photo you know or or you know share the photo and tax cuts and then in a week we're going to pick a twenty five dollar gift card\nOkay you're she's done that and the best and then also you know everything you know in Montana I'm sure farmed photo barn weddings are big are they\nYeah there you say that [laughter] 'cause I was reading I was raised ... pardon me in on ranchers and stuff like that here but there's an article in the wall Street Journal they were talking about how barn photos are just huge it's like wow you are they are never thought of that are that are on you know\nSo it was knowing that you know her pictures obviously are burned photos even look at buying Google Ads\nAnd we did we just set up a yeah that's a kind of thing you know Facebook ads you can buy as well ah she's\nDone that in the past but it doesn't always drive up you know the and did it out there quite like you're expected to for\nYou on the other thing that she can do is that if you have a mailing list your youth\nUh I I I walked out when he did that and like I don't even know you I'm Sorry\nAnd then there's also target they're getting in the battle between November first and December twenty second they hundreds of thousands of items are now eligible for free today shipping a target dot com or at a Wal Mart says we're going to give you free to day shipping\nTarget says ... give you free to day shipping on select items a target also has a few ... do you have to use your target credit card and it's only on orders over thirty five bucks okay so you everybody than their weight maybe this is something we can do to compete against Amazon Prime\nTarget says we have another idea they have the drive up service okay shoppers can play through orders on line\nAnd then you have to drive to target and then a target greeter is going to put your online order into your car\nAnd it's got to be available at a thousand stores I never understood why that is even an option white somebody at target thought that would be a great marketing idea when whatever you're gonna buy at target\nIt still to drive to target and then you have to find somebody to actually go get your water and put it in

you've ever had the chance to actually speak with him about this topic but his whole believe is that we are putting all these gadgets around us without thinking about the ramifications and that we have the Internet of things we have artificial intelligence we have Facebook whatever may be\nAnd we buy all this stuff but we don't consider how it's really going to affect us he was actually the

PRI tension or an ... or what have you is short and need to be replaced\nWell here's what's gonna happen if you unplug the pre tension or you're going to get a cold for shore to\nSee people have this happening can\nOften [laughter] I like the way you're saying yeah but if you unplug\nThe pretend that might be what's wrong with it now the plug it might be broken because if it comes on plug there are two shorting bars in there that that short across the um\nThe wire now some of them have him on the connector some of them are on the um\nThe early ... so what you need to do is you unplug it\nAnd look inside of the connector and see if there's two of you know metal bar that jumps across the two if not it's going to be open and you were would be correct if you unplug it you scan it into ... open that would indicate you have either one bad pretension or or to\nThe little clips was missing that when you plug that little plug it in there's little pause you locked it snaps in the back of it when that snaps in it spreads depart those shorting bars to allow it to operate\nTo make the connection otherwise it's in a position basically right so if that little thing and we've seen those break\nOn the Toyotas ... they're famous for break but if you had ever master that area of the car and you're wondering why could this just suddenly happen you gotta remember there's a lot of movement and vibration down around that seatbelt and things can happen but otherwise I Believe you can check the wires to that run along there I don't think they come from the top they come from the bottom and we have seen also anything that runs along\nThe silk Iraq or the floor paying that's a great opportunity for those wires to have gotten interested with moisture or just overtime\nWet feed you know ... ... that's ... that's going to be an older car Ninety nine it's got a number of years on it you're in a good climate down there that helped but I Would check the wiring going to they're also as an opportunity and that's why you're looking at your ideas there\nRight now let me ask you this or how would I go about checking the wire from the um the airbag module\nTo to the part of the driver's side shoulder harness too I Would it be okay if I unplug the connector at the macho and then go to the end of the connector and do a continuity check\nRight you need to disconnect the battery from the car weighed about Fifteen minutes and then disconnect that airbag model an disconnect the pretension itself\nAnd then test between the module and the ... century\nWhat you got to be very careful though\nBecause you want to make sure there's a lot of wires on that and you will to all the sensors and all the airbags you want to make sure you're testing the right one because if you and owned meter makes the test by sending a small electrical current out one lead and looking forward to come back in the other and looks at the time and things like that and resistance to travel\nIf you connect to know meter to an airbag let's say you're pro but it it was supposed to be this pin this pin there's a lot of lawyers are very similar colors and they're small if you were to accidentally connect to a different pretentious or instead of the one that you have open\nThere's a possibility you could potentially deployed and could set it off yeah that's that so you want to make absolutely sure you're on the right one\nAnd that can be done a couple of different ways is the wires were different colors and you have a wandering diagram off the Internet that says let's say PIN Nineteen and twenty were the ones I don't know what they are in this one but if those were the two and a wire is yellow and green and they match up for those pins then you go to the other end of the connector and you see the same pins same\nCaloric advice with this guy and this might be the worst advice I've given today advice from him today\nBut I was first just take that thing apart over by the pretense or physically look at inspect see anything you might have some that will jump right out at you and if you don't see anything in the wiring let's go before you start to ... you might be it'll go to a cell

we do for you\nAnd my question is in a part of the uh call what I Would like to have access to is a website where you can check the articles out before you purchase um the frozen car is is that just say\nWell there's actually quite a few of them are you know one of the more trusted ones over the years was Consumer Reports they have got you know they they\nI get suspicious anymore and everything but they claim to be fairly independent mhm and you always gotta look to see was funding what and and what angle they might lean but they have proven over the years to be quite independent on their tests and they've also archived a lot of their tests that they've done over the years that you can go back\nTo uh they test about everything car and driver motor trend wrote in track they are they like to test for the specialty vehicles first but at some point they do get into test of of common cars I and I say come and just the more normal stuff\nAnd those you have to be a little aware of because they might scores something higher or lower based on something that they think it's important that has no interest\nExactly and they will do long term tests where they put the cars into their fleet and they drive him up Consumer Reports those with similar thing there are but as far as the website are you thinking where you'd look and see okay this cars at this many problems reported um that sort of a thing I guess we'll make sure what they are looking for\nAnd I'd let it sit there and as it cools off watch them and if they keep climbing up as it gets cooler and then finally it starts running rough and their way off that's going to explain to her who she is going to feel tremendously well if you'll trim just ... the the engine computers says\n... were designed with this much fuel going in and this much air going in to run smoothly and with gasoline that's fourteen point seven to one they called a stoic you'll metric ratio is a big fan I were just means\n... pretty sure that at that rate I'll get right even\nThe fuel will burn it's cleanest with his most power and most completely you too much fuel its rich gets too much fuel and it's it's all the tailpipe to lean a that is also bad you get excessive heat and the damage thing so you want that perfect ratio will the engine computer at the perfect ratio\nMeasured by the oxygen sensors will say ... you know we're we\nMight we're ... we're both between ... originally originally originally resulting around that were right\nThere were zero well if you start applying a\nYou start doing things like adding ethanol to fuel you go five ten Fifteen twenty thirty percent even going up while the ... the computer can adjust for that it's completely electronic so it says less at more fuel were still perfectly safe no check ins and like\nIf you have a vacuum leak this very small as it gets bigger it'll keep adding fuel until it can't any longer when the ... the thing that can add via the computer or take away the up and if they like leaky fuel and check your well if it can't do that anymore it turns light on gives you a warning but there are situations like this truck that\nAt times it can control that fuel and keep it in that range and keep a laid off but when it gets cooler if it does develop a leak and that's just one of the things that could do it it could be as simple as a dirty masterful censor too but when that changes that's when the light comes on\nAnd if you had a vehicle doing this and it did not have a light on and it seemed like everything was\nFine it can either be that you've got a carbon build up in the veil of area and that carbon when it gets cool can really mess up you will spray in the field trim into the vehicle uh so you've got a you've got things that can come with age too that will affect this and I think we're Russ the point you make for our listeners know\nWe want to blame things on something but sometimes the ... the result is just a a an erosion over time of the state of new and both super she\nClaire thanks very much for the call that'll do it for another hour of the end of the show until next time you can find that that under the hood show dot com don't

second the wrong allowing had been his lawyer\nI think the illness progressed over time and got worse and worse and worse\nEnforcement sources say our claims he never wanted to hurt anyone in the bombs weren't connected homeland security secretary Christian Nielsen says everything is on the table\nAnd that and I really wonder but also if I can\nThe five year old daughter and your child is the five points remote or you're too they'll do Silverado will take you\n... well Russ what's in your town do you guys are at two hundred and forty five so yeah and I've seen them regularly at three Seventy three fifty a\nRegularly with sure with no major work done to him other than just maintenance things when a cooling pipe would break or a water pump goes out or a you know if the if you get a build up in it from just time of not getting new oil changed correctly that it's All right hurry relatives the transmissions if they haven't pulled a ton\nI think they usually they they can make it to two fifty a but if they get will live do you think I\nDid have an accident where I Do have a new transmission about forty thousand miles ago I er and I was I'm pulling anything I was just a overlooking an approach you know and it just didn't go into reverse for me so that was pretty exciting going down that hill but you know but I Do have a relatively new transmission so everything else is pretty south\nYeah when we look at those trucks the just to get very specific about that vehicle the temple or in\nGM's made him for years they last well unless you overworked them\nThen they will wear out when they are overloaded and overworked\nOr the front differential do will the front differential I wouldn't know typically last as long as you don't have a seal get bad and your slowly leaking fluid out then you run the grease auto them run the oil out of them\nAre the transfer cases it's kind of the same way I mean if you're just not but when you start working those things but they will break down one fifty to two fifty somewhere in there\nI don't know it's not an easy question to answer but uh if you've got a non rusty truck and it's working good and you consider that when you drive through the lot and I just happened to do this the other day they have to do two thousand Nineteen Sierra trucks sitting out in a lot and I thought of drive by and see what the prices on these things well do you want a six point two leader\nLoaded up half ton Denali Sierra the you know the I went for the highest price when they had\nThat one of the highest price wanted that particularly with sixty eight thousand dollars for a half to pick up\nThe more over the more basic one was sitting at about fifty three so you can\nCan you know put that in your ... your oh to this costs in yeah\nNot a lot right and right it's got to be a pretty strong decision [laughter] Aaron thanks very much for the call good luck so if you if I were just asking you know I'm going to go look at trucks what mileage would you like to at what point is really start to get married to\nTwenty five to fifty I don't I'm going to give you a different answer you don't even I'm leery at one fifty\nBut I Want to know the history of the ... I got ya that's unfair us\nYeah definitely because there are some really I have some customers that have\nSome vehicle you know I've been looking around for some like a top horror Yukon a new low newer one than than the old one I have and\nI Know there's some customers I have with a hundred and fifty to a hundred and Seventy five and I love the home though but I find myself looking at some that I don't know anything about so I'm trying to find something in that Ninety to a hundred range\nBecause I Know if it runs out of the head of AQAP with and it might be good but when you get yeah these you just\nDon't imagine Sam leery at one fifty I'm paying a lot of the tent out there you go to one fifty Darren thanks very much for the call good luck let's start to Aaron in Iowa Aaron you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nI was driving through Iowa and I've got a ... or ... or ... when you got ... automatic but make it up what you'll I mean when I was down there in

you say it on its way we'll get any changes\nWhen you sign up one the one thing that's going to happen to you might win something and they all that's going to happen in these are great\nThe people or the voting themselves both okay you just throw out there 'cause it seems to be my job and I'm okay with this job [laughter] we sell 'em to yeah they are available for purchase ...\nNot a huge profit center but we like to pay the bills are the you're right they are fantastic yeah yeah and they're good price you jump on the the er what do you store it under the show dot com or you can look there from Facebook you could buy T shirts hats antiquities here's a call that came in after hours\nMy name is Paul where I have a two thousand and three Chevy Silverado with the four point eight leader small VA than it\nIs beautiful condition that runs like to do but it developed a surge\nWhen I started a cold in the morning and back out of the driveway and they give it a little bit leap forward and then have them and then the next time I get it from yesterday we can do that for three or four times until the end of the war and that it doesn't do any more\nInteresting but those are just until it's more possible that we've got a vacuum leak\nWe go down that would actually wrote quite a bit but it's pretty common\nYeah and they're different in different vehicles different sources\nWhen something warms up what an engine warms up a lot of people have an noise like do here I have a knock knock until it warms up ... do we determined a lot of that as exhaust manifold leaking and as they warm up\nThey expand seal up they're quiet same thing happened with an intake gas expanse seals up the ... and doesn't surge other things on engines that can cause them to run\nPoorly cold or things like the\nTemperature sensors\nThey can do it and if we want to always inspect the air intake system\nTo make sure that you've got the ... a good connection between we see people put after market Arab take on and then not get it all sealed up right and they're creating of a foreign intrusion of extra air that may not be regulated at the right temperature may not be regulated posts a masterful censor is\nLetting the car warm up a fix or no it is that gonna it is it something that needs to be fixed\nThere's something going on and if if if Ross had it at their service center and the text they're hooked up to it they'd be watching the vehicle to see what it's doing on\nThe on the scanner with the rich lean codes and different things to see how it's running and they'd be able to pinpoint there's a lot easier but without hooking any tools to it you just want to do a physical inspection first make sure everything is hooked up properly in the air intake system make sure these clean you might even consider fuel injection cleaning and see if that helps the problem\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's another call the came into the hotline\nI'm Doug can I have a twenty four to Camry that has started probably accelerate\nStalling problems when you accelerate that seems\nBad yeah I'm\nA lot of cars will develop certain things that are inherent who them so when we see one that does this the one that does that\nWe know the model like that it leads us directions\nStalling on taking off in this model car there's been some issues with 'em as they age a little bit we if they're over sixty thousand miles we've seen some ... so when you celebrate you get a flashing check engine like you get a ... you know a starter as you celebrate\nAnd that is one of the things that can happen those quote pack so we went from a spark plug wires years ago to these in a separate oil to one ... per cylinder so that they can\nSupply more power to spark plug for a cleaner burn as you can just stay recharge faster because one will spark\nAnd then as the other four are the three go than that one has time to fully recharge we're talking about the whole lot easier for six people to do a tug of war than one yeah exactly and with the old one you had one coiled trying to hit every cylinders at one around so it would\nIt would not go but that is something to check first they need to check the state of to you need to have a mechanical that and see what the state of tuna that engineers do we have failed oiled or do we have worn a spark plugs\nAnd then you get into more more technical things or whether or not when you smash them the throttle is it is it reading that correctly is there a problem with a fella positioning censor I mean those are things that are going to be a little more finite in their diagnosis but all those things really if if you're not getting a check in July you kind of got to fall back to that based system\nBased fuel based electrical or when you don't start putting a light on it something in that delivery system of either fuel or electrical and that's what you get into some other stuff uh the rest of the talking about\nEight six six five nine for for one five all what's caught your attention and the automotive world\nWell Toyota's is issued a recall is better if you've got a an Eighteen or Nineteen tundra which is pretty new and yeah at this release we've been having some\nAirbag things going on and\nWhat's happening is is the car when you start to the truck when you start 'em up it's not reading all the sensors correctly and causing this thing to be the fault modes airbags may not deploy and a collision so few purchased an Eighteen Nineteen tundra and you don't know about it yet I don't know about this recall\nGet ... get the facts contact your\nYour deal your local dealer give them your vehicle identification number if you bought it from them they're going to have your name and the number on filed is telling her name there'll be a look it up for you\nAnd see if it's gotten the open recalls on when cars coming to our shop it tells us when there's an open recall and the majority of cars and we print it out and handed the customer and say look this means it's free it's a recall safety related\nA little bit rusty scout and I'm like oh this is kinda cool what year was it I Want to see what's the Seventy\nFour or five I'm going to look it up and then you weave in orange knows white it was hard to really it was it was I Believe will not had a thrill for a V. eight in it or something like that I make the money yeah and it was definitely an eight and for whatever reason into overdrive that thing could spin the tires\nMy ... one of my best friends in my cousin Todd he snapped a drive shafted it finally we we got a little too aggressive with it but that made a a number of runs up the split rock river\nWhen it was frozen in the wintertime [laughter] up into the trees I could talk about it now but [laughter] it was up I was the wrong person to pick up on my life right [laughter]\nIt was free right so I bought a raffle ticket right okay everybody was worried about you know their bottom of the split rode on all we we\nWe sold it to somebody who was still serviceable well thanks for calling me appreciate it Don Don thanks very much for the call good luck let's talk to Nathan Nathan you're on the under the hood show what can we do for ya high I\nI've got a two thousand five Subaru Legacy wagon and we've got problems with the rear suspension the bed the back of the car sex it almost looks like it's been lowered and we can't seem to figure it out on what needs to be replaced or what's going on um\nAll the the whole ... shock springs all that had been replaced in a funny thing I think it's gotten a little worse some kind of looking for ideas I mean I've even found on line where a couple of different places ourselves actually selling saying he bought space or for super so I don't know if this was a common problem that that's the solution or not\nWe're all those springs instructs replaced with brand new parts yes yeah and it\n... I actually replace the whole just by order the whole um shock and spring altogether because I didn't want to mess with a compressed into springs down\nAnd when you and I didn't even I you know\nWas it good as soon as you did that for a short period or is it still exactly the same\nI remember it being a little better but it never really fixed the issue\nOkay is it the same problem with the the grand presented Ninety seven to oath\nLeave for a full ready strode on there with everything on it\nCorrect yup exactly yup just handle it right on\nSome of them were just lower like with the grand prix in that car they just\nThey set a little lower when they were brand new they were good for ten thousand miles than they settled and that's the way they stayed and they were lower and if you don't like the way they that they do have some time space available when you put those space within it sometimes you need a lime and sometimes you don't depending on\nWhat is a modified in that suspension on a car but they they do ride the all the ones I can picture in my head right now that our customers have most of them ride pretty low\nBut and I pulled it up on Google Images all the images looked like the Atkins ride ... like they all look like they're saying look at it a little bit\nI'm not I'm trying to understand if he's describing something where he is or if he had some of those uh you know those", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Rapid City", "day": "27"}
