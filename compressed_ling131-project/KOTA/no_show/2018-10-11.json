quality\nAnd academic background and such a successful career on the DC circuit to be on the U.S Supreme Court and what really bothers me is that he had the qualifications\nAnd the Democrats thought maybe they can catch him up on something you know my boy the fifty votes and after a four days of hearings that didn't happen so then they started a every a personal attack that they could\nUh going back to when he was Fifteen Years old and there was no cooperation Fort uh but uh if they do something or the amount of money at stake throw it at the wall on a Tuesday something different had been

Senate and on the steps to the Supreme Court um this is what Maxine Waters said she was asked last night about\nThe uh intimidation and the harassment of senators and sort of getting it right in someone's face as a means to protest and she said this\nWhen we protests yet which shouting out we have signed with what we think we'll get to the public and we are not saying we're going to kill anybody and we're gonna hit anybody oh we're going to cause anybody in a harm that's a lot in the way that they're trying to redefine protest\nIs is that correct I mean what are your thoughts on\n[noise] well my thoughts are this\nThat public officials and and I I'm not a perfect public official\nBut I think we all ought to set an example of civility and so for US Senator to say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say get in your face\nAnd then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong\nOr I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate but it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't intend violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended\nAnd she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly uh I got to be a a ... you know a few feet away if\nWe got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our but\nIn your face is in a way to do\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nA and what does that mean let me see is that this I'm lesbian or gay elegy Beatty dinner and she goes into take him out\nAnd she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and\nTelling people that get harassed and restaurants and\nIt seems like that that message really had terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democrat Party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... get shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that uh but when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you pour all Susan Collins yet people being ... its scream data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean ... ... what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office saying in in public\nPlaces and we're confronted with that and they're doing it\nUnder what they think is the first Amendment rights the only thing you can count on it as a police protection and we have\nBut then you can't have police protection for four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress by every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police or you can't do that as well\nSo are are are I've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are\nA democracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you go hold on called get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to to speak against this type of harassment and intimidation isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is\nCornering more women

didn't\nListen to us Tom and what to paper registration forms or it's going to be a battle now but we did registered tens of thousands literally yesterday because of this campaign but with the national coverage of that Georgia\nOr what has not come out in the news yet I'm as is just another uh four hundred thousand four hundred and sixty nine thousand voters purged in Indiana\nThey just gave us that list we just put it up on Greg palace dot com unfortunately there are re registration deadline passed last night some people got the news that the last minute but here's the deal\nAre are um computer experts went through the list and said wait a minute we have twenty thousand people here that the state mark as having been removed by a our friend Kris Kobach interstate cross check the problem is that in Indiana unlike Georgia in Indiana\nThey have a federal court order the N. double ACP league of women voters got a federal court order that Indiana could not use the cross checklist to remove voters\nAnd they were twenty eight thousand and that's supposedly these are people moved out of state so we actually checked or with the post office is special contract with the post office\nAnd with a two hundred private databases we can confirm that at least twenty thousand of those people who are removed in violation of a federal court order at least twenty thousand and we have each of their names um\nRemoved in violation of the law and that they are still living at their registration dresses in Indiana they've been given no noticed that their purged please people I'm a show up at the polls bring ID and we're just gonna have to fight this went out to be speaking to the lawyers as soon as I get off the phone\nBut I think it will be given for provisional ballots there won't be countered\n[noise] uh it's the only thing you can do is fill out a provisional ballot do it but ah we're going to have to fight to get them counted 'cause they are they're they definitely will not be counted unless we can get another court order saying this violation of a court order um will not stand\nRight this is remarkable you know you know the power one person's story Greg it's so it's so great yeah like with the the whole you know these kids who are being detained in the children that the Trump Administration is putting in concentration camps right now and it's one two year old girl who was in court in New York ... earlier this week\nI'm her story her picture suddenly everybody was like oh my God ... you know and then it's literally fourteen thousand children\nYou've got twenty thousand voters there in Indiana who you can confirm are actual voters who actually live where they live who are registering to vote I'm guessing the majority of them are probably in cities or areas that are predominantly black or Hispanic or the\nNorthern tier and Gary Indiana\nRight is it possible to find one of them who is an incredibly you know all American or as you know a a veteran or you know [laughter] yeah well actually we\nDid we found many we because we asked people if Nineteen hundred people responded to our request if you are purge can you contact us I Know most people do not want to go on camera have their stories public but I Want to tell you\nI I'm not to use his last name but in Savannah a there's a a an African American gentleman named to one he's an F easily war he's a veteran he's served in Afghanistan I have pictures of him in uniform and with his helmet on in Afghanistan and\nHe was shocked he spoke to me and he said I served in the military I was in Illinois I ah came back I voted for Obama in two thousand eight and twelve and here I Am purged the only conceivable reason is the cross check list\nA they mark so they removed his vote now he did re register and time this is\nYou know an American war veteran and the head of the N. double ACP was shocked that they would take away the rights of this war veteran to want I Can't give his last name without a\nPermit and that's my point is the power story is insane I mean it's just incredible animal has said\nThat the head of the N. double ACP we looked up his name and ah he was he hadn't been removed but three of his relatives\nOr were a purge from the voter rolls that ended up ... feet you know it's and this is Brian camp and now I should mention by the way that camp and if you go to Greg palace dot com and you're in Georgia you're in Indiana\nEven if you now passed the deadline yesterday\nTo re register take a look see what the story is contact me we're going to take steps to try to get people back on to reopen registration to just frankly put people back on campus already lost two suits against I'm One of our a plane to Stacy ah Hopkins are and\nWho got a hundred and thirty nine thousand people return to the voter rolls because ah with camp and then we just had another forty thousand return other she takes off gobs of people get caught and say okay you got me but now as the election gets near\nHe's shutting things down his blocking the adding the names of people feel that registration forms and I should say he's the third secretary of state in Georgia's recent history to run for office and the only one\nWho is not taking it resigned from office so he's determining who gets to vote where they get to vote this is the guy's been closing polling stations around the state which ballots counted who gets provisional ballots who's absentee ballots get counted or rejected he's counties oh about the other two\nSecretaries of state resigned when they ran for governor not him because he knows he's running against Stacey Abrams who can be the first African American governor in us history any losing its close but he's losing and the only way he can win it's by making sure that Stacey Abrams voters don't get to cast their ballots\nYeah yeah and this this and this has happened this has been happening all over the country now uh now we know of I mean you know the the ... the high water point of this in terms of publicity\nWas when Jeb Bush in two thousand purged or what close to eighty or Ninety thousand African Americans off the rolls in Florida and you you're the guy who was doing the work for BBC expose yeah\nI mean we got the list of the purge voters and there and then right next their names are are where they're racist so it's often the L. A. B. L. A. for black ... and they were accused of being felons\nNot one and I repeat not one with an illegal felons vote or not one and that's what elected George Bush you know what I many people was that on a sheet to me how many people would die only four thousand on the list\nYou were aiming the waste funds from the pig farms yes\nHuh what to to just uh you know a muse bacteria or Saturday and you're adding brought us I\nDon't get what you could draw ... you know and and generate electricity\nYeah they probably could actually in fact each one of these a pig operations can be turned into a little mini power plant I'm\nA ... there was a rancher out there out west ... or ... was a cattle ...\nYeah I I remember that started I was a couple of years ago uh yeah and it's possible and that's the kind of thing that people might be start thinking about if we had a three or four hundred dollar a barrel or actually a ton tax on carbon or you know from fossil fuel sources\nOr people are looking at alternatives and that would be one of my I Would prefer to see all these big operations in North Carolina in fact the biggest one is owned by the Chinese government and a lot of that pork as being shipped back to China and we get the pollution and we get the poison and and you know we get the stinky a you know the air you know miles and miles being destroyed\nYeah I'd say it's a great idea thanks a lot Jim Scott in Missoula, Montana and Scott what's up\nYeah he's ... I think that we should approach to this from from a business perspective since that's something that that the oil industry would understand and\nWe should have a somebody like M. I. T. work up a Manhattan Project for correcting what we've done to the environment and what we're going to do to it and give the oil industry the option of either\nFinancing that Manhattan Project or painted a fine that twice as much yeah and\nYou know if we're we're looking right now at destruction just in the United states you look at the wildfires in California you look at the the hurricanes and and storm damage\nAnd and tornadoes for that matter across the the mid west\nI mean we for example a couple of years ago we saw our first mile wide tornado I think it was an Oklahoma first one of the history of the United states never before and we've seen a mile wide tornado these are these extreme weather I mean we've always had extreme weather events but the extreme you know ... times don't wear a magnitude\nIs the consequences of climate change so right now you could argue that the fossil fuel industry the Koch brothers all their bodies and the you know the fossil fuel barons Murray energy and all these other guys that that they really should be on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars of reparations\nThat in fact arguably the insurance companies can be the ones so in that and I'm you know Frank frankly I'm surprised that they haven't started it\nBut yeah yeah it's I you know we have to make it in and just incredibly uncomfortable and expensive for these guys and we've got to do it right away and Jacob in Baltimore, Maryland hey Jacob what's up\nThey don't pay for taking my call 'em\nIn terms of what we should do with the fossil fuel industry I mean I tend to agree with you that we need to do whatever is going to move faster I think personally that if you let them\nGo back in the long run ... you're going to be a multi decade challenged they're not actually\nHolding them accountable to end up having some long term negative consequences but only really emphasized I really want to thank you for talking about this issue because this is a ... different issue than every other political ones\nThat we have with possible exception of nuclear war in that we can hear in every single other progressive issue out there for a minimum wage to equal pay protection to minority rights across the board I mean we don't do this one does ... ... ... that it will end up evaporating infant\nI agree and I think this conversation that we're having right now is the why should be the main conversation that the corporate media is having\nAbsolutely I mean I\nThink that people in the past year the emphasized is the most\nIs the second one is coming up each human history what are you going to be spending your time on earth during the most important factor Thomas\nVery well so Jacob thanks a lot for the call\nAnd thanks to wash us there will be back with ...

Washington named Michael what's on your mind\nI'd like people to remember that\nCorn was a tropical grass and St we came from the Mediterranean you if it gets too hot in Kansas or Oklahoma to grow these crops you can't just start growing 'em up in northern Canada\nRight it was the daily life is too short that angle of the sun coming in it's not intense enough ... to ...\nYou just can't do it it's not just temperature it's the day Lincoln adult society will dry up because no food\nYeah you're absolutely right and then this is the really scary part and and and I think that we also need us are rapidly making the transition from growing food for animals which is the majority of our agricultural output in the United states and most of what we use are productive land for his food for animals\nAnd and start producing food for human genome vegetables and fruits across the Midwest and things like that\nMichael a well said let's try David again and ... are you out of your cube farm\n[noise] yes and they okay now I can talk oh okay I've been working for years now for oil and gas industry are parking designer so I Do like to do the designs for plants one of the big problems we've got mold is they should have poor people in the mid West is how he\nHe's your house natural gas price how you could just natural gas or oil lockdown\nAir ... your bill in concrete blocks for books that we use we just kill them down a dumb but we don't we don't factor him work she cost you anything we should say natural gas out of the gas stream one quarter of the ...\nBut like where I'm working right now are the healing process where they treat type it puts out tons of snow to math and of course is part of a component of natural gas which is\nWhat gets the energy and he started to ... you know it's actually a money park so there needs to be more incentive for for a man thing controls\nRats are you are you arguing David for a carbon tax\nA carbon tax in more detail that it's going to take the massive more it's going to take more mastery of that I think anybody is considering because unless you want to leave the poor\nIn the cold and not being able to cook because once they start raising the price of natural gas well they can't afford to\nWell what I got a model hand just saying that what Exxon model is suggesting is that a hundred percent of that carbon tax would really related to consumers\nSo that the you know if your if your heating costs go up by a hundred dollars a year you're going to get a check for a hundred dollars a year from the government out of the fund the developed by the carbon tax to compensate you for that so the cost of living and so it won't be highly inflationary the cost of living will not go up\nBut the cost to basically industry will go up\nI think that's a nice thought but I think in practice it will not be anywhere near and dear\nI agree a hundred and impact on how they figure out a way to cycle that money up to the very rich and set it on the average person but or the poor people yeah\nExactly yeah but you know the whole of the largest ... what we're talking about just you know in our manufacturing like he took part where you got to he treated well there's a whole expenditure energy and of course the external hours in the cost of living ... out\nOr what we do and everything and of course the methane where they've got their burning it off in mid mid part of Oklahoma in Montana and Wyoming 'cause we've got so much stuff coming up to pulling out the oil but they don't care about it they don't have any control there just burn it and you know with the natural gas injure\nIndustry when I seen this money because as the active part of the natural gas the birds right\nCertain things out how to put controls on that it makes it economical so or not just economic cool some companies have too long ago like Williams are deposed look we'll start taking the natural gas structured CEO two\nOut of the gas treatments we pulled her out of the ground right now we're just a bigger fat girl we needed a distortion trailer another from pressure and we can voice liquefied natural gas from being able to handle it and of course the process of beer and oh it's too damn expensive\nYeah I don't know who you're talking about ... four but yet you know I I Adelson again both\nIn the gas there's actually still too young to get your rights corn on the grill yeah\nYou know the guy and they walk right as a consequence of bacteria and chemical action David Ogden points thank you very much for calling and making them a a yeah Chris in Bentonville Illinois Chris what's up\nI'm I'm just gonna\nWe are done by ... ... years we're going to do something now\nUh we had been doing something about global warming for you know or at least over the last thirty or forty years we had been subsidizing a alternative energies and that subsidy is paid off hugely we have seen the cost of solar power go down by Ninety seven percent in the last thirty or forty years\nSo yeah I I you know we had been doing this we will continue to do this I you know I'm not concerned that we can't do this\nOr I'm just saying you know this is a\nIt's going to be a big challenge Jose in Grand Rapids Michigan hey Jose what's up [noise]\nHey how's it going thanks for taking my call a sure I just want to I Want to point out that climate

couple of weeks ago that I said no one you were going to be on was that you've talked about this but eating foods like bacon and sausages they say may raise the risk of breast cancer what's going on here\nWell it's an absolute fact or you know if my thesis\nFor my postdoctoral fellowship in the sixties and seventies I did twenty thousand autopsies I'm Seventeen thousand some change over four hundred and fifty four species zoo animals and three thousand humans are looking for\nA a common thread were animals were getting the same diseases in death of from the same pollutants because everybody knew the earth is going to end until he's from pollution as humans\nAnd when he found was of course that there were no deaths from a pollution\nBut the but I did find that when people ate one serving a day with a male or female\nThey one serving a day of any processed meat things like Delhi a slice of the sandwich meat sauce a ham bacon baloney salami pastrami pepperoni jerky armies bam trees all those kind of things um and increase their risk so many different types of cancers\nAt the same rate as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day I I wrote that up and published in Nineteen Seventy one everybody laughed at me\nWell in two thousand Fifteen\nThe world Health Organization and set it and then just a couple of weeks ago this big study in England where they said they looked at

there's no drug out there to be honest George that has that kind of\nTrack record you know new pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so so as I say\nWhat really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow and he he'll think the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in\nSouthern England that had where I live in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras in nine different locations\nAnd we had the cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent is rarely\nA documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews so these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed\nThis live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know it's the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else and\nThe Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nIt was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the ship your beach in positive will generally work rather than someone who goes into these experiments as doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at\nWhen we've done intention for individual for instance we didn't intention once for a kid called Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through self off a forty foot structure after is he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend\nAnd he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had a you know he had nerve damage\nAnd so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better and record taught the doctors didn't even think it was going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital I'm\nFar quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most\nTeenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid [laughter] so it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of\n... ...\nHow do you start conducting how do you scientifically put it to get\nI get a team of scientists George or now I work with a lot jar ah Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona the noted psychologist and a Jessica too is a very well known professor of statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... Roy I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities so we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had no real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done\nWith the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bought the trends then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd indeed no bloom the title of your newborn will power of he has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three or Fifteen\n[laughter] we'll see how they really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know\nWhat happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really\nDone many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's what I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young\nSo um so I I Will keep me around this with my husband and I'm sort of saying well I don't know maybe I'll just put people in groups of eight and or so and hadn't sent healing intention to each other and he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eight\nSo it came about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop\nFirst one we ran in Chicago I\nI was kind of I I knew how to do intention I studied it within tension masters I'd put together a program I'd looked at what worked in scientific in the scientific lab but it wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands what should they do so and I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured I'd I have him come back the next day and tell us what happened and I had all the groups and intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge\nAnd when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's it's kind of like having a facial or getting back rub do you know nice little feel good effect that isn't what happened what happened to stuff like this\nThey lined up I gave them the Mike in turn and they said things like\nI have cataracts and their eighty percent\nBetter I'm due for a new replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today and I can do deep squats I have terrible insomnia and I set up like a baby last night you know and on and on it went like that total instead healing\nAnd I was completely shocked because as I said I'm you know I I look at things as a journalist I'm I look at things I Try to look at the science of things I Try to prove things and this was completely out of my realm so\nI didn't believe it I like to be honest George I thought it was a placebo effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things and I've had people where\nTheir their arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal somebody with school yo says who went completely out of pain and within\nA month or so her daughter wrote me to say that her back straight in so much they had to change the rearview mirror for car you stories like\nThis over and over again and the same thing going on with some of the Sanders too and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo me are told me about this from Sean how how powerful much maybe and then what was happening\nWill their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of at George we all have this power this is our birthright it just we don't

work the power of eight limited should be seen how with work and it doesn't take much effort to make things happen\nThat was the interesting thing about this\nNo it does it I think what it takes is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow\nTo become a really good in tender and also to intend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is\nCreating a little group of eight\nOr so and you asked before they have to be eight no fiber work eleven or work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little um but\nWhat's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after\nPutting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health so I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I\nPut them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year and\nWas extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is\nSo it wasn't just their health you know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got\nGreat new house just the one they wanted um just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur our ... are you sure that this works uh primarily from the field wars or science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study and we found that you know there are major brain\nChanges that go on when you do intention of in a group called it group prayer in a way I'm In a

an intention experiment or power of a group that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like a ...\nSo that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting ...\nWill you know we're doing one this\nAt this someday undoing a pilot experiment like that in the mail is county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down into a big way next next spring um we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to\nThem afterwards you talked about a mirror of what is\nThe mirror of fact to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among\nThe receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome the biggest change all that was amazing to me was one happens to the participants in these intention experiments so when we started doing these peace experiments\nI started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're not able to get on the website and all that kinda stuff more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this um I felt like I was part

write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which sucks so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist so he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression any couldn't\nAnd so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of these ...\nHis depression and soon after that\nHe got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal list\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened\nOver the year not only did that happen\nBut he ended up going back to his fighting weight loss wait the it got back to his you know he's he's\nWeight that he was as a young man he um he is chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung that got better he got a writer's block and was able to start writing again\nUm he also developed some things to help other people with I think with depression a special um a special kind of technique and\nEverything in his life was getting better and even his trainer you know his his his his trainer at the gym said to him\nWhat are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but if he was one of the people who met religiously and in fact\nOne of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met and\nThere were times when Mitchell would say you know I had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to say I have a you know to to sleep better and so knowing you've got that constant support\nReally strengthening in every way over the year\nWhen when you do these intentions are not ... but when you do these intentions to do so what do they do actually I mean you sit there and think or I mean what what do they do\nOh okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intent or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it ... and ... or whatever you do yeah\nUm but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that\nWere intending all the time you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having you know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about my book the fields\nYou know we are and knitting energy all the time we're in meeting a tiny currents of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of a mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so we we have this one little power thought saying I'd like to have this um but the rest of the time we're thinking no you can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging yet and so\nOne of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity but probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about his being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a charge don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe will fill in the gaps\nAnd that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes sibling the gap in a really negative way you know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was a pull McCartney his second wife\nUm she was he had lost his love of his life Linda his first wife and he was mourning her and he met Heather who had been a\nShe was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model and she was a glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and she lost\nHer leg below the knee one of her legs but\nShe was very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who had lost limbs\nAnd that's when Paul McCartney met her now Heather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly after pull married her and it fell in love and married her you know she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle but I think you know\nWhat ended up happening is as the marriage got sour\nUm she they the British press started digging up all this stuff about her about how she had featured in porn photos and things like this it's just simply Heather from being very famous\nAnd kind of revered was infamous and so I look at that case and I think her big problem was she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so suddenly\nHad concert in ways that they have consequences right\nAbsolutely\nSo it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's an age I usually tell people you know\nWhat reporters have to learn is when they write a lead of a story they write in an intro they have to do\nWho what when where and why and how and how and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nIs your story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good strong\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want you know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich and you know they don't\nReally want to be rich what they want is usually you\nKnow in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is they don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore\nAnd the other thing I notice George is often times the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like\nUm I have one group on a master class a intention group of eight and they said well were intended for all of us to win the lottery and I said to them why\nWhat do you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars I'm for child\nAnd Joan needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you you know so it's\nReally about first of all figuring out what you want exactly and then telling\nThem to see what's going on yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with when Mick Jagger about intention let's start by going to Thomas in ...

party as the champion of health care and the Republican Party as the one that wants to take it away\nThat helps to explain why Senate Democrats forced to vote on a bill that would eliminate the

think it's really sad that we couldn't draw more than one Republican vote for a measure that simply says when you sell insurance it should actually be insurance\nBut Senator Cornyn says the insurance he's talking about is all about choice\nWe need more choices for consumers who they can fight healthcare price they can afford and that suits their knees\nMurphy says the so called junk plants don't

department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York do offer some thoughts\nI Know the relative speed with which Michael surged a short compared let's say with Florence the last notable storm which was virtually guilty of loitering why the difference\nWell hurricanes are are like ... and the stream where um the stream as a kind of a background atmosphere flow steering the storm in the case of Florence is kind of slow me entering stream so state over a long a period a an area over a long period of time\nOr as a Michael is in a fast moving stream and is there for moving quickly to the north\nI gather that in terms of wind velocity there's no connection between the speed with which a storm moves across the landscape or if you will exits horizontal speed if you as a compared with the the speed of its wins in in the circular motion the two are not related right\nRight the two are related yeah\n[noise] a storm surge again or is there a loitering stormed more likely to cause more in the way of water damage than one that moves rapidly\nIt certainly can cause a build up the search ahead of the storm and can prolong the surge as a storm as making landfall the storm is moving at a slower speed\n[noise] it's an impressive the titles certainly you have as a assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences there at the university at Albany state you of New York\nI can recall a time in my youth when we we made jokes about the weatherman and how accurate they were and by today's

things like Doppler radar which most of us don't really understand but it sounds oh so technically precise and I think we tend to think if he was miracle workers and we\nWe get on your case if you're

sometimes even five seven days allies we solve a Florence um you know Twenty years ago that would have not been off of all\nYou would do research that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and the interactions and for those who don't know by the way a psych loans uh hurricanes and type foods are all pretty much the same thing but in different locations is that right that's\nCorrect All right and and you focus on on those areas first let's start with formation what is it about a given spot in the ocean that indicates that a tropical depression is going to form their which may then turn into one of these nasty storms\nSo and in the Atlantic a tropical depression is foreign from clusters of thunderstorms that originate a off of Africa than move over water um we typically see about ... percent of these tropical a ... they're called tropical wave\nA developing a tropical depression is um typically in a sort of an August through October timeframe\n[noise] uh why August to October\nIt's because the ocean temperatures are typically the warmest in the tropical Atlantic or the jet stream as the furthest north around that time of year and the atmosphere is the most humid around this time to all three ingredients tend to make for a kind of prime conditions for hurricanes that far\nI guess there's no body of a larger ocean anywhere that doesn't have this type of storm when you appeared on uh uh my nighttime talk show last night you would have created that in general with obviously are obviously many exceptions but in general\nThe intensity of the uh the typhoons in the western Pacific tend to be higher than that of the Atlantic hurricanes is that correct and if so do we know why\nYes that's correct and that's just because the ocean temperatures just tend to be much warmer and uh the area of warm water has me a much greater in the western Pacific\n... is it ever do you think like they were going to be able to impact leaves the storms that is to

that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it that you're supposed to come in at both going to order that if you're if you're

of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happened and then as you pointed out in your intro defies of renewal the third Pfizer and then we'll get signed one month later so that sort of the timeline and what we want is all we wanted to bring you been asked questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this eh well first of all how was your age going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company in the throne a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\nYeah it's kinda like when the pilots the yeah the healthcare immigration taxes\nAre my opponent is a political liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions and because they\nKnow they're going after you and never come off\nBig time in our junior right right no it's it's a it's a battle and that they're they're resist or my opponent the resist\nI should really doesn't have a platform at All right now and so she's just running on the resistance than um than do vote and that's why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left\nI think the ah the voters in Virginia and argue the right thing\nLook I think we've been putting a specific race was a night um congressman Jordan I mean California Arizona meal loving Utah Colorado as a number of seats are there or\nWas it and if people want the full list look look we've identified the Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com at all so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressman or a woman who's in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days congressman driving\nI think we're going to win I think we've got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people a lot but that's the fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you frame it up on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there is that the left today is that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never got great material and Maxine Waters\nWhen she says go out and harassed anyone to support the president and we saw that doubled down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older sad about Republican\nWhat are you going to all the ... they're going after Sarah Sanders Pam Bondi secretary nearing\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today is a modern Democratic Party today's party of the Web has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish I'd never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and a piece of the president\nAnd you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished lifted phenomenal did this the other day but they get by the taxes cut regulations reduce the economy going a four point ... percent lowest unemployment fifty years well out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hobby come over North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we frame it up that way\nAnd twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do the things and make America\nWhy don't you know some of these candidates can't string two sentences together there's no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we've got to understand that and go out and get that kind of messed Dave Brat understands that he's not campaigning on the good things that are often with conservative leadership and his leadership that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the\nDeputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein an acting FBI Director those after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all men on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and the un McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recused themselves from the Russia investigation as as the caller is sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing\nWhat do you make that uh they brought\nYou know I'll just go back to the way your frame that you're on the dot com it's not like you're in Iran over time I get sick but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and now he won't show up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying no to the American people and when he just sat in your remarks\nThat the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight using evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress\nAnd if we don't hold strong a word that President is not good and I'll let you Jim go on with\nThe so it's a yes on ... ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein have it on like this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Muller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with\nHis his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should have disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but in the case right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote a memo\nFor why Kobe should be fired one of the things moment is looking into whether obstruction of justice into the firing of Columbia you gotta be kidding me so that guy's gonna oversee this so both of them had conflict until the ... that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other I'm like you're both right neither one of you should be involved in the special counsel any type of all there's not\nI don't want to thank you both for being with US Congressman Brad the seventh district of the commonwealth of Virginia\nOr one of the race in Virginia is Barbara Comstock seed is very very close race there from my hope people Virginia you get out to vote for you congressman Brad thanks for being with us one why don't we don't even have somebody like Jordan who's going to run away with you know twenty point victory in his\nYeah everybody out there go to Dave ... dot com yeah\nHistory ... series in history and this tells a powerful story and one that I think we really need to always be aware of and that is that evil does the yes\nI've talked about this for years it's very hard for good people or genuinely good people people trying to be good people\nTo understand their wrap their arms around the fact that how is it possible that you know communism fascism and in this case that he was writing about ... in the last century a hundred million human soul destroyed\nNow I couldn't put the book down as it tells the entire story of the\nPost war manhunt for the Nazi war criminals that even takes us to modern day and an extraordinarily well researched and I'm I honestly bill I think it's a very hard concept for people to understand\nThe type of evil that really truly did in Nazi Germany\nAnd a guy turned me on a program on any it's nice to talk to you welcome back to the have you\nVery a very troubling Chinese were living in absolutely and I'm following you close with you on TV and radio\nAnd I wrote this book partly because I wanted Americans should know that is true you ... and that we can't turn away from it figures that we do we're going to find ourselves down the road\nFacing a situation I wouldn't say it's going to be\nLearning a Third Reich but we're heading toward\nHate and the are dominating the country you know and you can see it you see what happened to a cabin on the attacks on and you see what and pizza is doing you see people walking into schools gunning down children UC thousands shot on the streets in Chicago by drug gangs I mean evil is everywhere\nAt every turn away as the Germans did prior to World War two we're going to be in for big big trouble here\nWell you know there was a moment and I mean the real history and heroes World War two somebody like you know you compare the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain with the Horowitz understanding of evil in his time of Winston Churchill\nAnd Winston Churchill and then we had this warning everybody you gotta pay attention read this book is the man is maniacal murderer and it took him and I think one of the most courageous stories in history as when Winston Churchill\nDuring the bombing of Britain walking among the people of London every single day\nI don't think you could ever see that in today's world but he did it and oh by well bud ... yards and sweat I mean what are we will fight them in the water was my plan victory victory\nOver any of my friends and colleagues of phone my county affected by the political recon fractions or make all around for any lack\nOf sentiment in which we can feed into his age where I Would say in the house and I said to those who joined the government [noise] I have nothing to offer a lot of oil and this time I've really inside the same\nThe age of I'd say then\nLet us go forward together for the United states\nBill that was to me one of the most courageous bold speeches in in the history of mankind\nAnd church will when he gave it didn't even know what was going to happen in the concentration camps and the slaughtering of men women and children by ordinary citizens\nI mean these were merchants and farmers and bankers who after the war put on black uniforms with the death shuts go on a cap went in and\nGashed baby and this is what I mean even exist says you just said in the introduction to\nThis chat evil exists and we in America have to face it and we can't turn away from it any more we see something wrong and I really thought the the attack on cabin on his family was so desperately wrong um\nWe had to do a U broadcast forty three years you know every two and four years if you're conservative or Republican you're a racist or sexist you want to kill children you weren't granted to but to go with the clip they'll have a whole Ryan look alike doing it\nThat that is a smear but you know when I think a real evil I think that nine eleven\nOr radical Islamic terrorism there is a political component you know why would America ever drop off a hundred and fifty billion dollars in cargo planes in cash and other currencies\nOn the tarmac of radical mothers that chant death to Israel death to America that to me it's modern day appeasement\nWell you have a you have a world that sharply divided in what is considered good and evil um and and killing nia says really brings home you're either going to be a person who fights against evil or not\nBecause some of the people who help these ss people get away after the war we're talking the red cross we're talking elements of the Catholic Church we're talking elements of the CIA hell\nHelped Eichmann and mango a Mormon and Barbie get away and and and you have to be able to distinguish in your own life everybody listening to us right now\nWhat is really evil me give me a real small thing you might have talked about it if there was a writer there is a writer for cold there who put out a tweet that said yeah even though Kavanaugh is confirmed at least we destroyed his life you saw that right\nI did when I talk a lot about it was horrible we don't care what the man's wife\nThat is an evil statement yup now that statement could not happen from Sean Hannity's crew or bill O'Reilly's crew it couldn't happen because of anybody did that working for us they wouldn't be working for us much smarter would\nThat no not at all did anything happen to the writer for call back nothing\nOkay so now you're starting to crystallize there are Americans apparently like Steven cold there we don't really care if they're members of their crew are trying to destroy other human beings doesn't really bother them very much\nThere will ultimately take it to
