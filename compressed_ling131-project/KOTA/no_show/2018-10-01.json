goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint you\nUh David as you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bet but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a ... a known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave ... have you back\nOn it George I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to me though I appreciate the invite\nYou want to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today ... that you make some personal observations that I have not ... I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books are insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into some of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities you\nKnow some of the missing to your own life right\nNow you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me as a family of people who have been washed and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and\nThere's a lot of parallels to my wife and a lot of these families and I've written about people that I remind me and myself a lot of times and uh\nI've put thought in the book just recently probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and hopefully people see that you know hey these people\nAre really really good people these are the drags of society these are the upper echelon and\nIt's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing or\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in a new to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one are you missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your book help in the sense that these families now reach out to you know that\nThey're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they are they're turning to you for some help her answers\nThat has happened and uh\nDon't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil the evolving with somebody disappear\nNow if somebody reaches out to want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can and there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been going to help and uh\nI I've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families are covered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating as heck the sit back and you hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions\nStop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search we're running out of resources we've got to stop a well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for\nWhat I tell these people as you kinda get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports a law enforcement reports\nSee who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they stole should search more because without that you're really searching blind\nAnd there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything you know I I find that baffling\n... well I mean that's how they treated you I was going to ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should uh anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service ... government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess\nI'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know that's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked with that bothered him didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't ... and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act request against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal ... lead trained police officers\nThe national park police and they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less ... and they don't have any listen missing people in their parks and jurisdictions and\nWe talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to reef refiled and they came back an attorney called this time it's like why do you want the information\nExplain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want to and I said well how research and then it came back and he said well you don't have any of us and missing people\nSaid well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the\nPatrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detective\n... so somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or acumen to uplift to headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it said no we don't have any less\nSo ... years ago somebody said well they are just file over crust and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that in Victoria left and of course they would but as it happened\nAnd they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my co authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list warming up a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books earning enough libraries to qualify you listen to such qualifiers just arbitrary thing\nThey said and then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the west front want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service ... and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system\nAnd I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting less from their entire system because we still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were posts have said gave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards and every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating\nThe lists and they could hire an intern during the summer of ... screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you stated in many others after you know nobody believes they say that there's a list exists\n... ... ... well ... ... ... ...\nIf they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exists you know it is it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on those but they don't want to more attention to be drawn to it and uh\nIt's a night we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's

well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\nOf this is one of the most frustrating parts of the end up in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and\nI'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites that have the name David flight is missing for one one missing and national parks are all fraud\nOr they're not me there are people that have used my name to get an innocent guy\nIn

moment about search and rescue ...\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that you've zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data to search and rescue ... ... how how they proceed and in a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases ... stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate ...\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name as specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled that the\nUh missing and presumed deceased ...\n... they're released the report most time a lot of times they want there was a case from eighty six\nI'm an air and the girl's name was the air if she was

class\nWhere she had fallen and yet she had just died so\nThere are still couldn't really explain how it happened that she had been gone so long and they found her dead you know in that way and I also wanted to explain how I had gone on civil walks often hikes uh when I Lived there\nAnd I would notice ... a wrestling why energy\nAnd the what's around me but I never could see anything moving and it would get closer and louder and closer and louder and kill it would just gave me so much I Would run down the hill\nUh it made me limit to how much I did feel a little walking because I was just really afraid I Would have that experience again and then another thing I thought was interesting is when they were fair I'm\nI was friends with people that were in the medical field than look at the hospital and we talked about our experiences that we'd had while living there and working there and ah one of the physicians explained to have several people felt\nThis dread and depression and anxiety and almost like feeling like they're being stopped\nAnd I and the most severe cases they had put these people on lets him in order to control their symptoms settled\nA they attributed that situation and those experiences to the ... and\nWhatever you know a influence that it's having on the people who live there and the people who visit there so\nI didn't realize that was going on when I Lived there you know it was all new to me this was several years ago but David really helped me understand what kind of experience I was having and how it could be that this young woman was found the way she was Sam\n... so you have the the feeling and you could hear sounds that suggested something was just off the path in the in the Bronx or the trees or whatever and have been an animal or something else\nNo no because um I like that but this was a late winter early spring when I first moved there so there were very few people on the trails and I\nDon't know if it was like it was almost like when they talk about that someone styles that you can see something that the lead the league smells that you can't see any feet hitting release you know to make them wrestle or a month so that was the kind of thing I was experiencing where\nThere was actually something there but I couldn't see it and I was leaving a you know\nWas advertising that it was fair and it would get closer you know as I got further out the trail so that's when I turn around and would come back and\n... you know it was just freaked me out I couldn't handle it so\nWell the the you're the words that you used to read and depression is the feeling that the boys had been there for a while I Would imagine that the people there are now who are familiar with what's going on for this cluster of people who

anything that's on line\nThe jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing supper bones that we know about that I'm also have a patch available\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has has patched up to them\nSo they did that too few states before um the two dozen fixing lets them and they've done that to more states are more county now um since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the intimate facing system could not getting at the core back and systems they're supposedly not connected to the Internet has not getting at the voting machines at all it's not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's also not touching I'm order the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're also used to tabulate devote so these are actually the most critical systems not the Internet they think there's some\nFocus so if you're if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence or are you saying there are there are some jobs here about whether or not we could be hacked\nOr there has always been the possibility for our elections as we used to be hacked to look forward to going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell the voters not to vote uh definitely I walked motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the back end\nA states and counties need to implement um mandatory audits\nAnd they need to have a paper trail is either a paper about the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail I mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want to voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't vote\nWho you point out there's really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nShow 'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots are digital those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other either need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are not looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\nAnd we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist the author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of election security how do we get so vulnerable\nOh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nBy in that case I'm sure everyone recalls the dangling Chad while you're ... that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington DC decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to system that didn't have any paper at all and that's how we got this system where we have today\nWhere's Kim Kim Zetter cybersecurity journalists Nineteen Minutes after the hour [noise]\nJust for some ... wants to buy for for how

though in different forms from before more from Greg if she economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use the\nWe've got to Christ basically because who uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk letter was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in price they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all about bankers investors and individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's an regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy and I think that helps explain the kind of economy we had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts in crises\nBut it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nIt's interesting you your own household and investors are much ... of risk what the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't flu year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there's several reasons for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that the limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess those that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we the investment if you look at housing ambulances meth and combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have so many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business [laughter]\nThose are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise] sure you have your ... to hear any real I'm up there but it really kind of the exception you know ... it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nBut people one is to not start the next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new business is being formed does actually historically quite low I I think it's troublesome I mean essentially a people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nSpeaking with Greg it cheap economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk for a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean\nOnce we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or they're not related\nThink it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street the bowl mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat has to say everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people for ... and fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise [laughter]\nI'm In the ... similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects are less likely to get a bus in a recession [noise] now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I and I think\nFor the circumstances but uh about which the risk of start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that caused a lot of crisis\nBut you know risque but kinda like goes away that sort of changing shape it sort of like water running downhill encountered a barrier to try to find a way around it and and we hear happening now\nSome of the risky types of loans that banks will make like to like heavily companies [noise] those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds [laughter] so you in some sense still at risk out there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a

they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank\nYou know could did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out ...\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you it'd be blacked out now he admitted to drinking or liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about and so they're trying to say well he didn't he we know we had to have blacked out\nWhen I worked as a bartender for a number of years\nI Know a lot about I'll go home I I watched it up close and personal\n... you know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose it for some people

so it's not about limited in scope\n... there's a lot of news or no time many of which I don't know where the clock is ... I'm more pan and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today and he said that he's a pollster was the Clintons pollster\nAnd he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of the last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found there's the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea as to what she's talking about\nAnd that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning of one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the electorate is thirty six days away ...\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want\nNow if this doesn't if this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of success the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power\nAnd after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want a crescendo their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got the election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels are going to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world\nAnd you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda or this blood joining of Kavanaugh this the agenda that just destroyed Trump\nThe agenda of higher taxes they want their crumbs back the agenda of open borders and eliminating ice the agenda keeping Obamacare\nThe agenda of\nNo nor rigid all is on the court they want judicial activists on the court ... that's when you're going to thirty six days a week from tomorrow or thirty five days from tomorrow ... that's what you're going to tune in with a five weeks are not very long five weeks election day\nAnd you get to decide whether or not those anchors are going to be happy or sad Claire McCaskill Bill Nelson a Joe Donnelly Heidi Heitkamp you know you got to let these people back in ...

cuts are on the ballot go to this website tax cuts work dot com if you want\nWords from his op ed refusal to most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement\nOf the problem with that is\nIf you don't remember something perfectly with the FBI and you're talking to them it took crummy it's a felony and if you don't believe me asked General Flynn and if you don't believe me out Papadopoulos who paid five years in jail\nYou know the idea that you know the FBI back\nIn the middle of it you know you're screwed that's what you know when I was handed the Clinton email investigation the deputy director said to me you know you're totally screwed right well maybe you shouldn't have been writing and made before you interviewed Clinton and before he interviewed any of the other Seventeen witnesses maybe\nMaybe you shouldn't have been writing the exoneration before the investigation\nScrewed if he did it right\nThere is no greater bigger case slam dunk case for obstruction of justice and Hillary Clinton the leading subpoenaed emails and bleach but nobody knew what bleach bit was prior to Hillary Clinton using bleach bent on our computers\nNobody it takes a hammer him but it's up there all blackberries or iPhone that you may take out the sim card you know when you throw it away so somebody doesn't recover personal emails between you and your friends that that would be OK\nTaken a hammer destroying it one thing it up\nI mean that's that's pretty amazing to me if that's not obstruction of justice I don't know what it is and then lying about top secret classified special access programming information in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet was a very purpose of a void in congressional oversight\nIt's the kind of a slam dunk case\nAnd anyway he goes on to but we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears it's work no\nHe attacked the upper echelon of the FBI you missed their call me you personally and he fired you and you obviously resent the hell out of it\nAnd you're angry about it and you're the one that was working with Peter's struck and Lisa Page Trump haters and you know your friend Petersburg or ... million or one Hillary should win a hundred million to one rather\nSo when there's bias\nThat takes over the top levels all law enforcement with all the powers of the top level of law enforcement or intelligence that's when we as a society or in deep trouble if we don't have equal application of our laws and equal justice under the law\nThen we're also at risk of this constitutional republic

moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying are where we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or discuss that enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear for a minute ah 'cause I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly would judge town\nThis is about a militant left wing group\nWilling to lie fascinates me or cheat I mean when you when you have when you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator\nOver and over and over again but you have on the left is a willingness to break the rules to get what they want and I think that it's a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years you know when people talk and I've watched a lot of the weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're mostly accused of literally drug in women and boys lined up halls all over the course of course of many weekends as the boys and then take their chance that\nGang raping women and being a participant in that\nI don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're in it then it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response of you're innocent\nRight well let me let me know plenty plenty historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through\nWhen you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh to Stephen example\nWho you're getting you know one one Blumenthal who is the president was pointing out this terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't know suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity\n[noise] as I thought about it I went back and found out the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City in Eighteen sixty speaking about the defenders of slavery who were prepared to destroy the union he says quote\nYour per person than plainly stated\nHis the you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please on all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all of an inch close quote\nI the reason I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you have people like Maxine Waters remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at that they're at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell the telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer longer longer which means what we've all suspect that they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it\nRight when you are but the point is I think you're right but I also think that there's got to be your choices made here by the American people\nBecause if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guide like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even fighting what it is nobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever well not if\nWe want people should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to counter and all they can do it to you\nThat can do it to your daughter they can do it to her son I mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total liar total fabrication\nTrent over a year is a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left as is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation they they don't think the truth matters what matters is power and I think people need to understand this election\nIs a choice about which America we're going to become it's much better choice or just the president of this is literally about are we going to reward people who are this destructive and who are willing to cripple their own country in order to get power or are we going to repudiate them\nAnd insist on people frankly are getting his results I mean if you think of this as an option of results versus resistance look at today's news about Canada and Mexico once again the president as a breakthrough once again something is being done to create more jobs in America\nThat ought to be a good thing and we ought to build a celebrated without left runners screaming at us\nWell there's not been one good thing the president has done or has been covered by the news media that is that's daily which just marrying and slandering Donald Trump this is just that expansion of Trump in this particular case\nWill pick it up on the election side I Want to ask you one question about that these midterms now in thirty six short days I call it the most important midterms in our lifetime and I'll explain why when we get back\nOr if you like me and you don't sleep well and you have insomnia well I've got the antidote\nBad reports for everybody in here most of the people sitting down there ... except for my ... [noise]\nAnd now for you Democrats and I guess I'm including you do the media right I consider you what part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be\nTalking about we want more time for the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein brings us up ...\nI I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot and so I don't know where there'd be big discrepancy yeah go ahead please can you you know what you're really out and say you've had enough\n... wind twenty five now told the top of the hour we're in our nation's capital the sewer the swamp Washington DC toll free our telephone number is eight hundred nine four one showing if you want to be a part of the program\nA obviously a lot happening here this week thirty six days until the all important midterm elections are my friend and colleague from the Fox news channel is with us Tucker Carlson got a brand new book out by the way it's called ship of fools how selfish ruling clients is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution and in that sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where\nA party when the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president um but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\nThat's what you know it was two weeks ago yesterday\nAnd nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital until two weeks ago yesterday and look where we argue they Tucker welcome to the show\n... thanks Sean well yeah I mean I have no is being destroyed not because of anything he did or didn't do but because he's in the way\nOf the Democrats retaining power it's not personal\nIt's just the party wants what he's about to get in so they're rushing him and his family in order to get it are we moving to a revolution while I don't know what the people in charge look at the Congress\nLook at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us for pushing racial division endlessly they're pushing gender division they're claiming that the Kavanaugh\nSaga you're the reason that women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control that divide and conquer the my oldest strategy ...\nWell you don't look I I've I chronicled the historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans are racist sexist I won't get the whole list but is likely or they want to throw granny over the cliff and now with Supreme Court justices\nOr if they have an opening there seems to be you know\nThere there there's nothing they will say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor kept\nYou know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself as pretty radical left now soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons and not not that are of snow for like last week\nThe exactly I mean Republicans left their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that case when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice without this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon his answer and Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was that this is going to be really watch the gas to me they're going to paint him as one within twenty four\nHours they live around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show runs the San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nAnd there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party\nOr you know if you like Republicans black cross of process are going to be burnt on people's lawns a cyber mayor well the James Byrd at I mean our war telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just I'm really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of books that what is now become a predictable tactic they get called out on the wreck cabin up until two weeks\nAgo yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations of all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... he is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ing girls and then waiting in line to gang in trail raped them ...\nAnd it is what's happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to war I went to school at one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds ...\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else it either in she on the tenth one was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven year okay I don't have time for that accent or the whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address and having to\nWhat you really have to be a Republican senator things you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time ... report ball and you have like the senator from Arizona's like really give us a hearing really\nThere are multiple claims being made yes they should be investigated this is the guy who's had six FBI investigations indoors background in the space of Twenty years radical clerics that allowed him\nTo the code the nuclear arsenal ... you would that that and yet we need another\nRacism claims they have no suspects are at all you remember our taxes for ... for them to strike and the obvious point she claims that this happened to him for people she says we're present or fortunately it didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up question for me it's a joke is what's actually\nHappening if the joke is only the Republicans in the Senate don't know what to\nDo all those are the ... either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like

to fourteen different times he found now they've indicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to you\nUh watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people I have but it's like it's like\nWell you're right on the parents that are on a reputation now if you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the up back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation\nWhich didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president app wing and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people in quickly dispatching leaves to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory\nUm which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a

consequences he says it's one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sort of broad from ... special agent and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them it was what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI endless you have a lawyer\nEver and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't look the upper ... and the cave and struck and page but\nThe FBI is is the FBI people I Know what the fault of the people\nAnd I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no and then they say look what happened to General Flynn\nGeneral Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the FBI I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd you just get them to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer if that's what all my law enforcement people friends\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match job you can be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says hey look his company companies MO right now it's just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and this is another another\nSection in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to live yeah see I guess the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as there is with their debts get if it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not\nThey've been kind of pretending they're ... that that ... I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI dies to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different saying\nWhat they're really doing here is there going down that same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't as a as a comic that can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they can they could be dealing with taking the same exact statements\nFrom the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this whole investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything that isn't there there's my protection\nUnder democratic ... that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... Romero's and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez contacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Calvin always the one who exposed himself\nWhich at that point tells me you know what are they investigating\nHere if she's asked for the other ... she telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigating\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was a morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even sure it with him she says like puppet he was in the room [laughter] I positive he adjusted hands whatever that means\nThat you still in it but I but I Can't say for certain hit hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work\nA lot of her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or cause they also that you couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I mean ... they're even count as a credible allegations of the you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nAnd they'll they'll get their statement and I think that if you look at the people out there\nThan it was only a guinea pig a whole New Orleans and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nBut there was a thrill to lose and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates

with the burden of facing the voters will now you're going to be who you really are I thought it sounds to me which kind of is it a mission that you've been defined as the whole time and so I have a suggestion if this is a trial balloon and he's thinking about running for president\nGet get in the game go run you know there's a way to get Supreme Court nominee through and that is you can become the president then you can pick your own personal ...\nYou can do what you think is best then you can be\nAs boring as you want to be is president every single day and maybe yeah maybe President Trump has more personality but you notice the style it always comes down style\nYou cannot argue with the results is what the media is fixated on this is what never Trump is fixated on there is an anger at the president iconoclastic\nYou know bombastic at times you know style that's what it's about a eight hundred diaper when Sean a toll free telephone numbers we continue from our nation's capital and the Sean Hannity show studios here that we have now considering we're moving in\nLooks like we don't have to get a place down here um I have a lot of meetings this week and a lot going on this week

brand new documentary they put together on opioids and how\nThe opioid epidemic and is is literally in large part being fueled by are open borders has\nA lot of these drugs make their way from Mexico straight on up through\nTo the United states small towns big cities you know we have over a hundred plus people dying every day or so you have a big premier to my congratulations\nThank you I really appreciate it\nWhen do people get to actually see it themselves and I know one premier night it's not available to the public when when is it going to be available to the public\nUm well we're basically working at a deal right now hopefully we'll get\nSome TV coverage from some really big shows were still working all of that out but you know if only we knew someone MTV\nThe alright alright I got I got the message I voted linked almost full on one hour documentary there's a real it's forty four minutes now and well for that is a TV our yeah I just wanted to make sure you knew it was forty four minutes yeah I work in TV I Know one of the TV our is\nUm which is a point but it's sad because we're losing Seventy two thousand people\nLiterally a year because of the opioid epidemic on a lot of them are young kids I mean these kids you know they get an mom and dad or grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet biking and Percocet ... and they think it's fun and the next thing they know they're addicted and there's no more supplying grannies medicine cabinet\nThen they're out buying it eighty bucks a pill and then they find themselves really addicted and somebody offers a ten dollar bag or heroin and now they're a heroin addict and there was set up as I'm ready to like eighty five percent of your addicted to the garbage and they can't get off it\nAnd then the next thing you know they're going to buy a bag of heroin that God only knows who's putting it together\nAnd they drop what is the equivalent of ... grain of salt\nThat's how tiny it would be upsetting all inside of the heroin and these kids die and these adults or even done\nWell I think I think there's another point to where they'd be a chief with interview today and he made it very clear that the biggest threat to national security is a Mexican drug cartels so what's happening is not just that people\nIn the article in the hill I saw that\nToo Yeah John Solomon wrote it and and and John Tom and wrote the article at the DEA chief I'm ... and you know did that's in and took some time in this from the film that we did and just said you know\nThis is very serious and we're we're looking at it very closely but there's a huge misconception that the border since about immigration when in fact the kids are dying on the other side of the border national security helps us both not an immigration issue it's a life or death issue not right or left life for\nI don't think anybody I don't know anyone else and media here that line I did live or die yeah now now not right or left life or death I ... I heard the line life or death and give you credit for\nThose very good very very catchy but the but it's true and it's our polling often reminds us this can happen to you because of this happening to a lot of people and I don't think there's anybody listening to this program that hasn't been impacted by opioid addiction or addiction of some kind alcoholism but this was the worst\nBut it's a hundred and Ninety to death I day a day that's every day one day every seven minutes and that then by the way and they're saving a lot of lives with nor can which were versus the effects alright but not that no not all the problems ...\nDefinitely needs kids don't know it so it's like even if they're taken ... which is pretty scary for the college kids they don't know that I'd like to know\nThat one time one dead you know it's terrible All right well congratulations again when it becomes a boss or when it becomes available we will tell you how to get a hold of it All right as promised let's get to our busy telephones here as we say you can't even read this Lin is in Orlando Lynn Hi how are you\nSure what's going on how are you man oh I'm sitting by the expressway waiting on you to put me on [laughter]\nBut yeah certainly glad we got young what's going on no rationale\nNo but I also worked for Bill done of a ... in Athens, Alabama\nWow what'd you do know is bill was the by first professional radio gig in what Nineteen Ninety\nYeah I er I heard you say that and all those uh you know ... what I heard that but uh I Do it the a list or appreciation radio concerts we had down at the airstrip and hunts\nBill ... remember those on the radio station\nWe had a country radio station and he had a a you know today's hits yesterday a classic it's W. the YPG which was a big big station that\nI wouldn't be given what\nAre we doing the one for a Pashtun radio was what I eventually became sure right yeah\nMy buddy dorm in Norman used to work in the mornings there was one of the funniest guys on radio ever knows a great guy he'd call and then later on and do all the time and I wouldn't even know Tim half the time\n[laughter] yeah that was those are fun days and then of course eating those big stakes foreign cutters down there on university\nOh you bet on and the ...

your players it's been a little bit of a challenge in the back in the terms of hey how are we going to play it do you feel like that's been rectified if you've dealt with that this was yes\nYes you know we have a we have a good plan for the team you know but the bottom line this game's about winning one on one so so eventually our guys got to be the guys\nYou know you look at them I'm from a running standpoint Kareem Hunt had a great year last year with the national football league in rushing to stay has been used as they could be an overstatement but he hasn't been used as much in the three games as he was last year\nI agree and when you watch 'em run it's scary so what they've gone off and nobody's going forty parts of game without him being a true factor that scary looking\nAnd the defense of moving forward in a in a football game you know speaking\nOf your office ah you'll lose a really good young player this week and Jake but I you know had a chance to get to know him a little bit and uh what an upstanding young guy and looked like he was just starting to sort of come on is a big big part of what you were trying to do often\nRight I mean it's it's been a year and a half way he's rehab and gotten back to this point and that get hurt that way and practice on a pre practice this a job through you know to have this third ACO it's heartbreaking for the kids and for a football team I mean he was coming on\nWho's making plays for cellular and he's a match up ... you know for a lot better than safety so I felt for the kid expressly but our football team goes suffer from that you know I\nI mean I played in the seventies to the mid eighties I I just don't remember having that many a CEO injuries across the league I mean there just seems to be over the last ten Fifteen Years and in Oregon that amount but they seal injuries I'm not smart enough to figure out why do you have any theories as to why we see so many\nI have I have no idea why you know but I can tell you it is a seal Fifteen Years ago to you guys probably year to come back now it's seven eight months hopefully he can get back here and play for next year\nA finally gave me a couple of things tonight I mean obviously you got to score points but as you sit and look at this game called this game what things have to happen for you to the best chance to win\nI think defensively you know we can't wait you know we have to attack this off and said or make some plays early on get them in a third out they've only had twenty four thirty thousand three game which is a pro game that's crazy you know so we gotta win for a second down get him in a third down so we can cover in Russia's this passer\nOffensively I Want to be aggressive early you know I ... I Want to score some points early you know obviously keep the ball from that often but be aggressive ... because they haven't really had to play from behind they have not to have not had been hit by two and three scores from a jump in\nAnd finish that way so let's see what happens if we can do some points early All right\nGood luck there not if you very much that's the Vance Joseph show presented by Maris dark casino resort spot Blackhawk step up your gate will catch up with Broncos insider might cause that will be next and this is the gateway Broncos radio network\n[noise]\nI always look forward to kicking back and catch up with my friends it's usually the best part of my dad funny stories last big smiles\nCounty branched out that's me\nEvery smile were sharing is worth protecting\nAs the nation's leading dental insurance provider delta dental makes it easy to find the right dental plan for you to keep your smile healthy", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Rapid City", "day": "01"}
