it\nYeah and you know it it's funny because I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are ...\nToday the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage or the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture [noise]\nUh where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the\nThe ... on marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\nAs well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think if you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nYou have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all ... we're we're going to be a nation of liberal\nWhy can't people just hear about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a\n... the ... election I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president de ... takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that do you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter I thought that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nYou know I Know when when when you think of the mind of people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal then somebody would ever think about ... an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know this is\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing ... we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nYou know I mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get the they didn't agree with each other you know in I've never seen that this bad and you\nKnow I Know I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\n... you know people ... ... ... ... I I I Can't tell you the number of people George that say to me you know why don't we run our ... our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we will make all these mistakes or if you think about it\nI'd rather have a government that runs like a government diplomatic or government or a Republican that's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that\nYeah we used to have that but now we have a government that's actually run on business principles and it it seems like there's there's no ... you know we were just taken all we've removed the rules are in a way that the we've taken away the diplomacy that wasn't necessary\nTo be a diplomat what what's going on with China China's freaky position China right now uh they\nRelaxed their their their child to write how many people uh many children do family can help\nYeah they really have many say one now which is the absolute positive ... last thing they should\nUh it's it's a you know I don't know why I really do and I and I am not that smart I'm really not in my wife or my kids they'll they'll tell you but ... ... ... here you have a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second we're already at the top of the hour we'll come back and talk about China plus will open up the phone lines as we talk about demographics

while still at home I doubt that little one buddy young white and blue and white\nAnd uh we had to add something told by all it can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I Will vote for him with my allergies and everybody said oh he has a right to a private life to get that if he did that\nI was over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with can say whatever you want because you have to remember it's reactionary he that if you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you have found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature that kind of thing I definitely agree that you had is that\nI'm now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm the I'm not that old either\n... when I was a senior in high school I had that country is nothing more than that I think that's a and it should be run like a death not\nI have started to successful business with myself\n... men and women don't have time for now it's

with you on both of those things\nAll right let's get it let's get his comments data and the your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\nA well ... ... regarding running it the the the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country in the ... the single biggest enemy to any country or the period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think most businesses are bottom line oriented you're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for screwdriver or toilet\nA easier to pay the fair market value or even tried to get it for less when I think when people say let's let the country run as a business loop talking about things like that where\n... let's not waste money as a nation\n... ... I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that are our country is a republic where the constitution and the constitution works we're we're the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but\nThe but the Republican camp that that's that's my position on the white\nAnd you want to comment on or do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\n... yeah you know I I I don't disagree with with a ... uh the fact that this a porn star and in our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just a ... not areas\nYou know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nWell they were but let me let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified room in back off the reading and stuff like that but\nIf you let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to\n[noise] uh I I think that we're in a ... that their punishment would be what they've said and and uh uh I\nI don't know like I think what he has done to dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and uh she got it and I mean it was a reason for that could lead to it who pushed it who knows but ...\n... ... ... ... ... I guess uh you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other ... how much do mired yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks are you already said I'm done with them and ends at length about\n... ... exactly George C ... and and I respect the the ... the criticism I really do love of my comment because when I stray outside of demography\nOr my position is on the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a lot of very macro view a very thirty thousand foot a view when ... you know would you\nDo ask me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that that'd be that's what I feel like snow again yeah kind of what what's what's going to happen going forward\nIt is right now we have a polarized country and the the country is polarized ... just like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people and a huge population of old people and in between there was a small population that does not offer\n... the the a position of of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's\nIt's what it's all about that's the way it should be exactly yeah so so my my comment today and it would be thank you for your position it's for that yelling at\n[laughter] let's go to the show in Long Island New York I'm Joe go ahead\nAnd two questions on it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more hits the patients that are ... and one issue them ... ... people have a ... ... you know than are\nAnd how the system that's amazing explosion basically it's a lot of people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level what what time of the size of the sense that if you look at Japan people used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked a hotter than individual level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office till midnight or whatever [noise] uh so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon or\nI Know they get criticized putting out small prior\nTo us and I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally\nEven at even under your for example I got I got this great gloves the shoveling my neighbor of snow and that's the main thing I Need it but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota [noise]\nI'd go for the first question ... ...\nTo reach George ... used this guy named George nine seven three one pretty soon Georgia Tech misogyny time at eight one eight to nine eight seven six five to one from the gateway to the west coast to coast am with George Nouri\nWell next hour we're going to dabble with the paranormal it's called timeless the paranormal personal history you're going to really enjoy that amazing stories to be sure beyond belief dot com that's our television program has new free videos for you to watch\nAre you prepared to uncover some of the truth big foot Martha ... this monster simply go beyond belief dot com and look at some of the free videos and I hope you decide to stay\nStumps out technology making a world of difference for so many people\nTrips to the dermatologist can be expensive with that in mind Dr Nathan Newman designed a product from his bath knowledge of stem cell research that is available without a doctor's prescription looming out uses stem cell technology not actual themselves play to do with Sarah them\nFor application to problem areas on the face and neck like fine lines wrinkled and bags under the eyes here as Dr Neumann to explain\nIn the beginning we were using adult stem cells ... for burns and ... and ... the treatment we found the skin was getting much better in the laboratory we went and looked at how these cells tries to deal with found that they're using chemical language to get together and the chemical language is what we've taken\nAnd put into the winner and product that we have purely the chemical language without the cells themselves\nLooming out is not available in stores but it is available from healthy looking dot com\nFind genuine aluminum products and especially the lumina thorough with the highest concentration of Dr Neumann a P.

or are they in a different position\nThey are there are really in an entirely different position and that but they have their own problem there about one point four billion people in fact we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is that there's more people in India that there are in China but they had about a two and a half trillion dollar\nOr GDP and then what the end you know it may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states with twenty\nTrillion or GDP there's really no comparison felt it it's it's not India is not an up and

you pick out I guess the items that they have there and\nThe most popular items I guess that's selling that monitor that week or whatever and you just pick it up and go I guess cellphone charger things of that nature uh et cetera\nInteresting then I bet they would use their website to let you know what products are going to happen to the store at any given time\nI'm sure and that's a great thing for people or of the older generation who don't really feel comfortable with the computers they can just walk in pick out what they want and go as Amazon Go\nInteresting take on Sundays that

and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get\nMaybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just the cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and and uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common\nThey've either they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical ... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the course into the course um\nAnd ah it it it's been a wonderful experience that really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I\nIs that different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book and we talked about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby a steak house which will be fined\nA that's a hunted and I'm\nSo that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to go ... Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing give me your scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you see I I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or a I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose they that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I\nYou know communicate with with those that are in the spirit world it's say the ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and\nIn both cases it was it was shocking\nTo say the least but uh it uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they will I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying I think their purpose was just ... they were tied to that location so that that's my\nImpression that uh and my explanation for what's going on with that and now it's different than when I I Am visited by someone who's passed on and I might see an image of them in my mind but not like out in the in the open\nKind of a thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent\nWhat they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho couldn't eat just the ability to manipulate mind over matter I happen to you\nKnow I was the uh the unfortunate victims of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany and a lot of these things happened in Germany West Germany Germany's a very magical place I'm the I'm\nLiving in an old uh well in an apartment above a ... house which is like a a a German bar but there's like rooms to rent up above it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base and a\nNew one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed\nIt was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off to bed so I got up\nAnd there wasn't anybody in the room and ah I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I have to go get something you know some water or something and then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating\nLike there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving and it was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah at my wife at the time or her hand mirror a clock\nAnd a few other little items that were on the night stamper vibrating and some of them fell off and I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind disgust house this bar and there was a Green Belt and then there was another apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the only thing or I Hope you know not only will just it just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as\nI think he recognized I looked at him the vibration stopped\nSo I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tele kinetic powers because it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there the the the items stopped and I\nYou know and I didn't have that feeling of somebody pulling me off to bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that and\nI'm In St Louis that when you went through that red light and you made it through a live loser reason you still here have you figured out what the reason is yet\nOh yeah and uh it's it's related to what this vision I had two years ago with my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come to this kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said\nUh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that\nYou know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does\nKind of you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but I you know I don't know but uh I I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in ...\nOh yeah and uh it's it's related

understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out you know and and are\nYou know very chronically under funded because there's you know it's difficult for them to get funding and I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives as is try to figure out\nHow this the spiritual world works and it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do\nI I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me I don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there and then and there are some real people that do for a living and I don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living of it you know fairly being as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and uh they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed that when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know\nYou know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that\nThey can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but uh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on in in there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I that that\nThey use guy named George nine seven three one three to Georgia Tech

get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when you watch go back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell we it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency ... I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom because not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBecause not only were they wrong and twenty six team they also are wrong and two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's filibuster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had\nFilibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the ... midterms rolled around Thirteen months later a GOP not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine seats Senate landslide\nRemembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to\nGive away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into a all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world and all that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great ... growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose\nIf the house remains in Republican hands on Republicans pick up a number of Senate seats they will lose ... just like they did in twenty six he this was a this is all white lash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them saw it in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could win\nA given the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had\nForty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now the GOP claim they similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal they were saying they might they might well twenty then was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing laws for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nOld they were wrong pure research was wrong I Know meanwhile over at five thirty eight Nate Silver was saying the poll showing Republicans retake in the Senate by a slim margin\nWith oh they were wrong to just like he was wrong in twenty sixty I think we're asked me this was the only one that got a right\nSo the bottom line is you have the power\nYou have that they can't stop you you're a citizen go register go vote and go shocked the world to get it'd be fun and I'll tell you that I can deal with whatever it's either going to be a split decision Republicans win at all or I'm really bad night and you get to decide\nBy the way our friends have shown the darn it again these guys are amazing first it was genuine sell to get rid of bags and puppy and his son to rise it became almost instantly their best seller ever\nNatural peptides a plant stem cell therapy guaranteed to work and twelve hours or your money back everybody was raving about it then it was the\nGen yourself sunspot correct or if you have aged ... sunspots you know what it literally removed them you can see it happening almost before you were very eyes now they've done it again if you have a little bit of a sag on your draw the line\nWell this is now the new products from January sell their jaw line treatment would do\nFind out for you and took all that well is that an Eighteen year high it's an Eighteen year high wise Bloomberg spending all this money ... throwing him at ... at democratic candidates for the Democrats can take back the house because we haven't had this kind of\nEconomic prosperity growth for all these years ... now we've got four million new jobs eight million fewer Americans on food stamps and in\nPoverty ... we've got more opportunity than we've had it over a decade for crying out loud things are growing by leaps and bounds why would we want to stop that's what the midterm elections should\nBe about ... Bloomberg owned eighty eight percent of Bloomberg ... that was a pretty quick thing I'm here's an interesting article so the president and millennia go to Pittsburgh today after the terrible ...\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media have all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous ... it is ugly it is twisted it is sick it is the family story ...\n... and frankly there there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point\nThat you ought to be able to sue for such slander and and live all those comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi ...\n... you know who watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political target and then he's receiving hate mail you were saying he would welcome the\nPresident to his place of prayer ... it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God and a temple and their gun down ... anyway the\nOrganization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today alone from an identified man swearing and angry at them ... they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and\nPro Trump while the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue ... was anti Trump\n... and as Ron d'oeuvre or had said ambassador to Israel as Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard anyone president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you ... which by the way the way it should be ... you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue ...\nIt's unbelievable the ... the rate the rushed to politicize ... pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump ...\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit you\nKnow ever since yesterday morning the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation's why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\n... rose tenant a friend of this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it isn't saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody\nThe mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community ...\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political ... ... ... they would want to give them any attention ...\nAnd then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers ... he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors and priests and\n... you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just ... dying inside I don't know\n... takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\n... no my friend David shown on this program has been to the tree of life says rabbi Myers is an amazing man\nAnd I'm ... why wouldn't you want the president to come and comfort your congregation there's never been a more pro Israel president ... in my lifetime then this one\nIt's just it's just the fact all these presidents promise that Jerusalem which is the rightful capital of Israel all going to move it from Tel Aviv Israel then they never do it because they never have the courage to do ...\nWhat a Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the region I said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my work\nWell why don't we have a little bit more of that ... ... ...\nIs one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is going to he's fighting for it so we see it now happening on the immigration fight or the president and Lindsey Graham of teamed up ... to and birthright citizenship other words if you enter the country illegally and it happened to give birth to a child the child instantly\nEven though you're in the country illegally interest in ... and ... leaves just automatically a U.S citizen doesn't matter that your parents are here illegally ...\nWell that there's only to encouraging other illegal behavior we're asking people we support immigration legal immigration I\nMean that was the caravan organizers loading ... illegal migrants on the buses had her for the U.S although some of the people now have been turning back\nUm the Pentagon now is deployed over fifty two hundred troops they're putting up barriers or bought barbed wire and other things because we can't have what happened on\nThe southern border with Guatemala Mexico Mexico southern border where people just rush across and rush over the police you know we had apparently a confrontation yesterday one dead dozens injured as a caravan was clashing with Mexican authorities we don't want that here\nWe are saying if you want to come then come legally don't come illegally respect America First thing to getting into America has to be respect America the sovereignty respect our borders ... respect to America is\n... um ...\nThis was getting interesting about Robert mall I don't really know what to think about it I'm a little torn about even talking about it but\n... apparently Mike Allen ... you see if I can pull this story up here is a tweeting out that special counsel former FBI Director Mueller is accused of\nSome type of sexual impropriety against women and the FBI now is looking into it that it's a false stories so I Want to give you both sides of the daily news has a very different take on it and they're headline is FBI asked to investigate allegations that women were\nOffered cash to accuse Robert Mueller of sexual assault I Know for a fact that a tape exists or where ... there is a very prominent person\nPam Coulter CBS\nNew older was eighty nine years old President Trump has arrived in Pittsburgh where funerals are being held today for some of the eleven victims of Saturday's synagogue shooting correspond a bill rake off is that that Seneca\nEmotions run the gamut outside tree of life there are people who are upset with President Trump's visit holding a protest nearby then there are those who support Mr Trump like Mark Brooker Jewish immigrant from Russia he carried a make America great again sign in anticipation of the visit\nBut hovering over all of this as the unmistakable the motion of grief the community as they begin to bury their dead bill ray cock CBS News Pittsburgh\nThe president talking about ending birthright citizenship at least with regard to children born in this country of non citizen parents\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive\nOrder them as heard on actually goes by HBO such a move would likely face a legal challenge and even Republican allies like house Speaker Paul Ryan you\nObviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order Ryan was interviewed by W. B. L. K. radio we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in and and the constitution\nThe president's deployment of five thousand plus active duty us troops on the border with Mexico is a big gun expected to be ... by the weekend far in advance of the arrival of that caravan of would be immigrants from Central America\nI'm cammie McCormick at the Pentagon officials say these troops will help harden the border with their gold aircraft and concertina wire it may have stepped in building tent cities from migrant\nPresident Trump has denied that it is politically motivated these are active duty troops rather the national guard their duties would be the same the first troops will focus on Texas and Arizona and California at\nThe close a dial up four hundred thirty two points [noise] this is CBS News\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps and your legs and feed you there where it's really fast

that of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nAs a treat tack to be able to do a disproportionate response\nTo what what is really vendors organization that he won't deserve out\nThere one of the most radical organization than Florida ah they they believed that the police and prisons have no place in ... and that the police needs to be funded they paid they said the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world and our military needs to be caught they if they favor replacing what they can\nDisaster capitalism is their words with socialists principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro squash so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believed in what they're doing is endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty days sleeping protests at the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen\nMonth long anti gun protests or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement there in the free enterprise there and the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money a report that he's getting money from left wing billionaire as like the George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida the help him\nGrow yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\nSpeak to his and the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors and force them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it's really a family arrangements have millions and millions of Floridians that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned into force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase what what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business and and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that went on governor buddy of Andrew has his way\nHe'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to end that you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and they also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolished rent a vice is that\nTrue he supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding already in the duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does well I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe this controversial background like it looks like the almost the phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nWithout crash landing day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate um they do not\nLike the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those Bob Bob release after he lied in the\nDebate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that at the end of the day he has been given\nVery kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the Cape and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out uh they definitely don't want to know their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery of thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm uh but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nAre in the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election but there's Laura's their own\nThey're doing a lot of everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballot\nYou know the bad news as it used that it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend\nUm which we weren't sure if that happened that quickly I mean I Know the rest of the folk there's a combination is being made so they are resilient people died in the Panama City area and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm In uh the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding a part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado in wiped it out\nYeah look I mean is it going to take time I read said with me coming in as governor I'm going to have to deal with it and take off were request off I Will say though um had that gone forty miles west\nPopulation would have been much bigger\nI'm sure there is damage and its extensive damage but I think it's damage in a relatively limited area there's a couple area that got hit pretty good so we know when we got to do and I think we'll be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any repairs necessary for ten do air force base\nIs an important not active duty side brought some really pleased that that is going to be fair\nI got to take a quick break we'll come back more with Florida gubernatorial candidate congressman\nRound Santa is on the other side might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices in programs from cyber

role as a way that is being minister and animals die and we need anything about starting from scratch\nWishing for families that need our help and that is not what I think today and that's why I Believe you should get rid of that start over ...\nPulling that put on local newspaper column Katie how campaign reported on her campaigns live next representation and relentless attacks and pointing dealing in news and I'm\nLike you I'm sick and tired of the political rhetoric is meant to scare and voters and I want to tell you exactly what I Believe\nI'm Steve night and then I Believe in Medicare must be protecting I Believe our senior some earned andme reserve these benefits and I believe that our veterans should get the best care of them that's why I fight for seniors in our veterans in every day\nThe night you served our country in the army in years on from there with the police department compound down where he and his wife really bringing their son named one of them in\nMy part and then members of Congress ... more crime party line to get results for our community something and to some charity and Medicare standing up for\nVeterans needs for on\nThe night and I approve this message I twenty five now till the top of the hour that was the ad for Congressman Steve night California's twenty fifth district and there's been an influx by the way uh he's been in office by the way since like twenty Fifteen\nRunning against the Democratic challenger Katie Hill and a ton of money now we see millions and millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg who is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job with the people that state anyway he joins us now congressman\nHow are you shone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ISIS old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat or Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of these are really being targeted a tipping point\nRaces at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today or how much money is being thrown at against you and\nTowards your opponent ... well I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a hot sauce it's a New York city because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nOr that's not something my eye on it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nYou know what are your ... not really I think the colds are what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people that use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided to advantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n... I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that\nHe thinks he can he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republicans for very long time and uh we're going to win the seat but uh yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's got to a saturation point you know and people are just so upset\nI think people getting wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they're not going to\nListen to it any more they go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male home um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox\nNow do you have enough money yourself to fight back on who you are\nYou know we're putting on our message we're putting on a message on what I've done and uh how complex thanks for this district and people like that so that that's where we're going to continue to do and\nHow do you feel about these other races Duncan Hunter Rohrabacher ISIS all see the other you know Southern California districts that targeting how do you feel about those six because that could be the tipping point one week\nFrom today well I tell people all the time you know Southern California is a is the hot spot right now and it's it's because uh you know the two people that are looking to be speaker or in the next session are from California\nAnd uh so they're looking at these days but I I actually think we're going to do well I really do I think maybe he's doing well I think Dan is doing well [noise]\nUm it's it's going to come down to the candidate though that's going to have to pull it through for themselves a lot of money is coming in and there's been a lot of help and I appreciate all to help with the candidates really got to pull a true\nAll right well we wish you all the best and your race a Congressman Steve night again if you're in Southern California if you're in the\nUh you know seamy valley area if you're in the Fresno area the Bakersfield area you know we've been out there a number of times those are all important seats and uh that could tip the balance of power in D. C. and that's why all that money is being flooded into their\nAh anyway we'll watch your race very closely us the night California's twenty fifth district thanks for being with us\nSanctions on Russia\nOr let's get to our busy phones eight hundred nine four one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program All right Andrew is in Albany New York WG why Andrew Hi how are you and by the way Albany is like a sewer unto its own\nIn terms of every single high powered Albany politician or every friend of theirs ends up getting indicted I've never seen anything like it in my life\nSo corrupt Shaun Shaun\nAnd I'm looking at the New York times website not alive polling I don't think that it by I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want to Pennsylvania one on the computer right now do you train them going on a district first national\nThere's no one answer is no one else and it's all skewed towards gunk close to Philadelphia I put ... ... ...\nI I'm not sure exactly what you say explain that again you think the hose or inaccurate I agree OK\nYeah and I think if it's just a son who wants to cause a lot of good for the first uh most of the Republican vote that it was in the morning or suction right on the border with New York right right well good I don't want to answer the phone above the it's almost ... towards the bottom hurts Philadelphia ...\nWell that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look at every ... here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live\nI we are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota raises California races but the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection\nCBS News it appears Bolger was severely beaten by\nOne or more of his fellow inmates he was just moved to a different president he was eighty nine years old President Trump in the first lady or in Pittsburgh to pay respects to the victims of Saturday's mass shooting at the tree of life synagogue CBS bill Rick off is there\nThe president and first lady arrived a short time ago here at the tree of life synagogue joined by daughter Ivanka Trump and son in law Jared Kushner treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin also here they've gone inside the synagogue shortly they're expected back outside for presentation in front of a makeshift memorial containing the names of the eleven victims of Saturday's attack\nBill re cops CBS News Pittsburgh\nThe first funerals were held today for for the victims thousands of mourners attended including Ben Roethlisberger and Mike Tomlin the Pittsburgh Steelers much more on this story in tonight's CBS Evening news\nLess than a week before the midterm elections President Trump is promising an executive order that would end up birthright citizenship which is guaranteed under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution he told actually goes on HBO\nIt was always told me that you need in constitutional remember when you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can be nothing to human yeah there is less than ... well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress\nCBS News political consultant Leonard stern horn says it is pre election politic executive\nOrder as well as sending troops to the border this is all about his crusade against immigration and how it will be received\nBy his base of voters who agree with him on this issue\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan told W.

like that they are purposely misleading the people of their states to make them think moderates when they're anything\nBut and they're all all the people working for them or in on the boat secret\nWhich is don't tell the voters in those crazy voters in the ... capital of the world a meth lab democracy Arizona the state known in a famous way in a Lindy low and kind of way do let them
