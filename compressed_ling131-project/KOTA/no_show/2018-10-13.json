control\nAnd they have been given marching orders from everyone from Maxine Waters to ah Cory Booker getting their faces pushback on them\nOr and basically try to intimidate people into what supporting you joining us now Amanda did a\nPhenomenal job and helping ensure that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United states John Cornyn from the great state of Texas senator it's great to have you on and thank you for all you did\nOh they're cute little process\nIt was a ... was a the results were a little uncertain at times but uh we got it done and got a good ban on the Supreme Court um couldn't be happier\nA senator and make sure you speak up you're a little bit you know a little bit soft they're um oh\nYeah there you are much better so senator what is your take away from\nThe level of vitriol and fury okay after the cabin our during the Kavanaugh's confirmation process like I I clerked for Justice Thomas on his second year on the court and I was indeed the studying for the bar exam when\nThe Anita Hill hearing happened and there were there were some protests but it was nothing like that it is right now nothing if it's much worse and it's much more hate filled [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean the Democratic party that I used to know has gotten hijacked by people who disrupt hearings are normally mild mannered senators what Cory Booker will

that the more successful Senator Cornyn\nThis administration is the more Congress unites with the president on issues such as the state would actually and United it's almost like it to driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing that they are there more and more angry\n[laughter] what was you know or the holy grail for it\nDoes the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now porn or two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as our confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point in the presidency\nI'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a\nA two to this unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThe interview with a colleague Ted Cruz the challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's\nListen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA job just to believe in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails the bar on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she or importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that\nWell they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas I'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area\nMy only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left or who are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of a mob rule\nAnd then it or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard Becker very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the crews see\nWell I think Ted's and cuts in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout\nWe know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see down the and the turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings shove energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said well he would have voted for\nA cabin all but I'm the truth is if you are what the Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nSee the change your body Seventy seven to seven one night\nAnd we're back at O'Hare stadium in the regional health

you're on the air\nTony is hey just just for everybody right now we're getting a lot of first time caller is here we have a a seven or nine second I forgot how long it is to lay here in the studio it's for an obscenity delays so somebody dropped Saturday\nAnd Sean can push a button and boom that nine seconds disadvantage shows before it even gets to air so there's that plus you know it takes a few seconds and for the wonders of electronics to get the signal from Aaron in Denver and the satellite up like the satellite to process to back down to your local radio station for your radio station rebroadcast so in that and that\nIs depending on whether you're watching TV or radio or whatever there was a delay of typically between ten or twelve seconds or as much as twenty or thirty seconds from the time that I say something to the time that you will hear it on the telephone\nOr excuse me on the air but if you're living on the telephone you're hearing in real time and we talk in real time so when you call in Turner Cheney down turn your radio down and just listen to the phone while you're on hold because when I put you on the air you're alive\nAnd you won't hear it on the radio

time I don't mind\nGo beyond down in Florida year ground zero for resistance and had a great secret talking about them\nAnd make the comparison still not out of American history and that's the point that I Need to have everybody to believe acting as if Trump is something new um we can go back fifty years eighty years what it does not matter um but the point about fascism and I I Love Mitch McConnell in this too because there was no more of a\nPower grab in a fascist move than the judicial move that you made 'em that you need to ask the Trump people cut to the phone to try to save them for this country because if we don't it will be some kind of social civil war and the point I'm trying to make\nWhen you ask people about trees in\nThat Donald Trump committed for that you believe he committed or if you ask about Brett Kavanaugh whether or not he is so good a woman for drank too much you don't ask them whether or not these people did ask them what is your gut feeling if you found out it's true\n... you're going to find out because I've done this with her support is you're going to find out that it's not treason as long as you're leading Democrat\nIt's not a salt as long as we're getting a conservative on the on the Supreme Court and that's the argument these ... you need to bake it these people um the last year of reality in fact we know has been going on we know about climate change you know about science we know about history\nThere is no such thing as history science or back or reason with these group Trump will be gone\nAnd when he's gone we don't have the same remnant and as you said the word pernicious is especially good because it's like why it it's ... it's the Republican Mormon if the evangelical right\nFor playing the game of let's say that but it's all about the power grab yeah and um that's the only point I wanted to make\nYeah well you made it very well Mike thank you very much amen I all I can do a second and Jill in great falls Montana and Joe what's up\nI'm John I'm\nI Want\nTo point out that the woman that called in power WorldCom numbers on a encouraging people double provisional ballots\nMight be a troll ... as Republican opera can I doing this city can actually because I've heard her on other call in program which there and I I think that it's just done intentionally to confuse people Bob ...\nYeah I'm I'm with you sure I can you hear me\nIn there\nYeah sure sure uh um you know we ... we have this uh this fabulous little phone system here that the shura is the uh the lord and master of ... runs with his thing\nAnd it logs

Kenyatta what's on your mind\nHello miss department how are you today\nI Am great but I'll get better how 'bout you\nOh shed digs or listen I Want it to a I have a lot of things I Want us to talk to you about since I had the opportunity to last a speak review by as there's always the case of things are\nHappening so rapidly uh it's kinda hard to it's almost like a kind of always on your heels with this news cycle and I wanted to talk about the Kanye West as much as I hate to yesterday but it is prevalent in the news\nAnd I would love to hear your thoughts on that can uh\nUh well first I Want to tell you that are clearly a Conyers is a has some mental\nDifficulties and looked to me why and I've you know I used to work in this field it looks to me like he he he looks like a classic bipolar person and what we used to call manic depressive\nIn manic phase or you know a person who is experiencing mania of some sort you also see that a lot and people who abused stimulant drugs cocaine and ... and and even Ritalin\nUm but that's what it looked like to me what are your ... but I'm I Know nothing about Kanye West I you know I I Know who he is and I've I've heard is music but I'm not I'm not a fan I'm not you know I I don't know that much about his life other than the married came crashing right\nYeah ... and that and that's really what I wanted to to really say Tom I'm a that was a my observation and I'm certainly not of a professional or in that regard\nHis troubles began when he tried to say that you know the the two countries should watch to\nTies with the Trump White house so I think that\nThat is interesting I Wonder if that is why I'm wrong is what provoked a Mohammed bin Salman to reach out to Trump and then you know do do that whole song and dance to to impress tromp and suck up to and yes\nAnd also you know the fact that um\nThe president's comments I'm sure you whatever that today on your show\nI haven't yet no I have a what basically what Trump said is that a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of arms sales is more important than a human rights record and by the way it's not really a hundred and ten billion dollars with the arms sales it was twelve billion that a Trump\nA mid deal with Trump are so good thinks the games but actually there still is no deal I was just a a memorandum of understanding so there are no arms sales or at least from the Trump Administration ... you know goes back to deals that rock Obama caught so Trump is lying through his teeth as he always does\nAh about this but apparently you know the Saudis have handed tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump in in laundering money or buying apartments and things you know from his companies and they are currently uh staying in the Trump Hotels\nAnd ... you know to the tune of tens of thousands of dolphins a day in some cases are all over the country\nOr you're correct to also here's what he said twice when he had a chance to at least backtrack a little bit of what she did and\nUh he has alluded to the fact that the show is not a U.S citizen here's here's the quote it's in Turkey and\nIt's not and it's not it's not a citizen\nAs I understand it right but the thing like that shouldn't happen president said again comma this took place in Turkey and to the best of our knowledge ... is not a United States citizen is that right question mark\nSo you know the point is ... is a resident he lives in Virginia and he works for the Washington Post\nNow people are starting to put out a thing there Tom which is pretty disgusting that all the media never went after Saudi Arabia only when when one of their own is gone after they've always let them slight on human rights which is not true the media is more than expose it but the United states government\nLets Saudi Arabia slide so I just wanted to mention a little bit of background there's also very interesting fact it because\nUh the president's son in law Jared Kushner is the quote Mideast guy you know and obviously very close to the Saudis as he was at one point in time with a guitar east do alone you know his father tempted to get\nA a lot of wrath is going to go back to cushion or two on this because there are businesses that are ... are pulling out of it is a conference that Saudi Arabia was going to have one after the other including news media\nCNN and others are pulling out of this a big\nEconomic a conference Hoover was the last to pull out and ...

also a tradition\nUm it's harvest time and uh in the tree tradition of at a veil of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pay more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform\nThe public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where a strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirit ...

take calls next hour as well before we get into open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a natural human the human they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years that I can control spirits I can control demons but it's\nNot true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attacked children in their cribs ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energy if they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there are there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the earth around us all the time\nWe just can't see them and they communicate with us ... either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives\nAnd also check your change or the way we think about each other right now they have at each other's throat right where they\nWant a fairly sure do there's no and we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nI Would not say that I'm not a free is I Would say that I'm an independent\nFreeze ... freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and ah have your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in first and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal things I wasn't touching anybody anyway just really\nIt's not necessary there's no such thing as as a ... on a non physical\nLevel it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and saw anybody can be cleared from anywhere you know how to do it\nAnd it it's it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits needs to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain a clarity other living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean your own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion not the only one\nOf their qualified extra systems just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me I help everybody\nSo I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with fires and around those stars are planets and there are\nJust universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question I\nDidn't know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at\nAll no you don't do that no but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christian have you know they need

like to commute to work without ever leaving your home well not long ago at thirty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family it's been twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America he researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had real long term potential he bought it\nSlowly and I just I you know shot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was\nI'd I'd have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately uh on me you know I've got to change\nTo me from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um\nSelf conscious than and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house and now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the rule you\nKnow you you just sell to learn\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if there are negatives spirits and somebody's home or negative energy\nI get rid of it how do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely beyond the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I\nThink you've got rid of this thing oh is usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly and not only in times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away\nEspecially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere guide telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drain\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy for my coworkers we all generate negative energy and we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit\nAnd so there are people calling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey you're really really helps you know very very seldom out of the spouses of\nClients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happened you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible personal might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already by different things some remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George pending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around six people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes close unless I'm walking around really on a business or a house and so\nYou know or they feel better you know and and you know the white stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has an effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirit is attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attract negative spirit demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy fields both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born and regenerate emotional energy\nAnd also things you pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy\nSchool people go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very youthful but I mean think of the moons of Jupiter elated\nAnd so people would be calling on comfortable they don't know why\nAnd the body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release that I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a prairie session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good mix them costs you adjust for\nMotion energy more that people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota are welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about Iraq and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am a up and Minnesota\nAnd\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that what happened off the ... follows me as I said it would\nAnd I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated math\nAnd I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried one thing my house was sage and everything else um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean and I'm I'm\nNot getting any where do you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nWell definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loose ends up emotional energy boosters up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense\n... there is many substances that work very very wealthy boosting up energy is kind of like spring something on the wall to get something off of it\nBut it doesn't alone get rid of the home\nSee that's the problem is is that stage will release it\nOut into the atmosphere but it will not removed from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think that's going on here to Jay is the you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nRanking sense all of these things you know I'd recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things\nYou know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent emotional energy in negative there is all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kinda like you know they can really pushing that all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and get it in the dust and into the garbage got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening All right\nThanks for that now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy\nGerman people generates both positive and among a negative emotional energy is from the very first day there were orange orange and these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the aura but the orders not just a bunch of pretty light\nIt is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional system\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become traps over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nWest northwest

to watch\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a broad range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the ... demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nA while what why are they hear him and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity of people actually blame the watchers for humanity's ills\nAnd that's one very\nDefinite point of view but then the other point of view is that\nThey were ... year they came from the heavenly around from the rump called sigh on according to the Bible the location of God's throne they're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity a teaching about how humans can transform into angels\nAnd make the journey from the earthly around to the heavenly realm of science\nAnd it seems that that what happened in the intervening centuries and by the way it was\nThe watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and then it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed by the ... the idea scenes\nApocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being an alcoholic being maybe even an extraterrestrial some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers\nAnd the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash and light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes do they not right to ... says well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there is no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty

Nineteen forty seven when they were were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers or the end what realm are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply\nAnd only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flooding that continued with new blood lines after the time of the flood\nThe second viewpoint is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings light being ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies\nAnd face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status and then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me when\nThe heavenly thrown of God referred to as ... and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this and go who are these people ... what did they know how to stay

tradition\nUm it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that there's a\nVeil of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I found that to be somewhat true but the thing\nThat I deal with happen all the time and uh but the media pay more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\n... do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirit ... something to do with that\nDefinitely uh we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative and I'll get into the difference between those two if we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd the I think that there's never been a time in our history where demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and\nAlso people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take

miles relate protests\nCalls for particular investment so it's always got to be clients specific or or situational lay specific\nNow the reason that it's important to start there is because in order for us to move past our own bias which we as individuals are always take to the situation we want to be able to have an open field where the data can lead us in whatever direction it needs to\nAnd from there we can really start to analyze what the purpose is and whether or not there is a whole that the insurance with then felt\nFor some people there may not be in fact there are a number of situations that I've seen personally where we've actually advised the individual to potentially not carry the life insurance that they have or at least to structure and some\nMaterial way because they really were either over insured or they simply just didn't have the risk that they were ensuring against previously\nBut I also think that there's a number of situations where people are under insured and they're under insured really for no other reason than the fact that they just simply didn't realize some of the holes because they hadn't yet emerged yeah\nIn fact this is actually a phenomenon that's pretty unique to retirement planning which is that a lot of the problems that people bumped into throughout the course of retirement are ones that don't initially emerge you know it's easy\nSo to speak when someone has a clear cut situation where there's an immediate problem so for example let's say that somebody\nHas expenses of Seventy thousand a year and they're getting\nThirty thousand a year from Social Security and they only have a hundred thousand dollars saved and they know that it's not enough for them to be able to get the other forty thousand a year that they need to cover their expenses well that's an immediate red flag and a clear cut example where they know that there's a problem but for the majority of people\nThe distribution phase or moving from you know working into retirement or people that are already retired it's not going to be that clear cut in the initial phase in fact most people are probably going to look or start out in retirement feeling very favorable\nUm it's only after time when situations emerge where you know things change life happens so to speak that you start to find that potential problems now emerging but the problem is if she ever made it to that point it is really difficult\nTo actually do anything about it once you get there it has to be something that's proactively thought through you know I have a really good friend who's in advisors been an advisor for probably thirty plus years with a couple offices throughout the country and I'll always remember something that he said he was using the chess analogy\nAnd he was talking about how you know really good at chess players typically can think two to three moves ahead\nBut that if you're a grand master you can often times think seven or more moves that and when you're thinking about the role of a financial advisor really is to be more like that grand master the intention is to be able to use collective experience or collective wisdom to quote unquote see around corners\nFord in retirement and truthfully it's not that clear cut we've seen a number of scenarios are families individuals' where they were either over insured or just simply didn't have a risk to guard against in which case they didn't really need to life insurance and retirement but I think more often than not we find scenarios where people are under insured\nAnd they actually would benefit from having life insurance and retirement and that's what we really want to explore you want to talk about some of the different utilization and Casey never considered it as to why life insurance may still be useful in retirement\nSo in our last portion of the show we were talking about long term care or life insurance the long term care alternative and we were mentioning specifically\nThat there are many what are called long term care hybrid policies out there which can be structured inside a life insurance contracts\nAnd provide you with the ability to not just guard against life insurance or the death the risk of death but to basically have a pool that you could access for chronic illness or long term care needs as well that's going to be universally true whether you're a single married divorced or widowed or whatever it might be in fact you can almost argue\nThat in a situation where you are single or divorced or widowed that really makes sense to have life insurance is a long term care alternative assuming that you don't have a long term care policy already in retirement because oftentimes if something were to happen and you would need care\nYou really would have to have somebody that you could hire to help you whereas sometimes if you're married\nWhile I don't often recommend just trying to turn it spells into a caregiver I've seen the impact that can really have on our relationship but at least that I guess in some situations that option\nThis next utilization is really talking more to married couples you know if you're married one of the things you always have to consider in a retirement plan or what are called survivorship scenarios it's very rare I shouldn't say it's very rare it seems like it's more in common\nThat in a married couple that both individuals pass away at the exact same time\nIt's much more common that one spouse ... says the other spouse and that creates that survivorship scenario in which there is a surviving spouse\nThis has to be kind of factored in and looked at in a very unique situation because oftentimes one one spouse Prieta seats as the other it creates a change in the expense base fact pattern and it also creates some changes with respect to income for example\nLet's say that you had an individual and let's say in a married couple both spouses were basically collecting Social Security\nWell even though the surviving spouse can take what's called a survivor benefit from Social Security which is equal to a hundred percent of the higher of the two benefits\nYou can never collect more than one benefit from Social Security per individual at any given time which means that you're guaranteed a reduction in income because the smaller of the two ... benefits is going to go away years ago there is legislation that was out that sought to basically help minimize the impact\nBut it never actually got pushed all the way through and so it can be a potential problem for a lot of individual still same thing if people have pension income you know not all pensions are going to be elected to have a hundred percent joint in survivor benefit and and I'm not suggesting that they all should\nBut if it does in let's say it's Seventy five or fifty or twenty five or goes away altogether that could be another area where there could be a reduction in income so you have to think through and it survivorship scenario if one spouse where to produce the other\nWhat income sources that are currently being utilized may change or go away altogether and then you have to think about what is your ability to replace that income\nIn some instances people may have sufficient assets where they can simply start to tap into ads at pools that they weren't utilizing before and be able to replace income and that and stuff\nBut I'd have to say in a lot of retirement plans that we've assessed over the years if one spouse where to predict sees the other it would actually create an income shortage in which case the surviving spouse really have no other option\nBut then too hyper accelerate the depletion of their other assets and I think this is one of the cases where you really can't see somebody go from relative to financial\nFreedom so to speak to literally running out of money you know anytime you're in a situation where you're forced to use an unsustainable withdrawal rate\nAnd it simply means that you're basically taking money out faster than it can be replenished then people literally can run out of money and you see that happen and survivorship scenarios but you also see that happening when there are changes in health\nBoth of those scenarios where people are sometimes limited in their ability to be able to change their expenses fast enough\nSignificantly enough to be able to fix the situation of themselves so you know say that a different way if you think about somebody who maybe has health issues\nI've never seen a situation not to say that it hasn't happened I just personally I've never seen a situation where somebody needed medical attention medical care in the same way that you might make a decision that I'm not going to eat out any more I'm gonna cut cable I've never seen anybody say well I'm just not going to pay for my health expenses\nSo if the health expenses are what they are I've\nSeeing people fully depleted portfolio or assets trying to pay for health cases in fact just last week\nI met with an individual who sorted out because he had some questions just around Social Security planning and some other things related to their retirement income distribution and he was telling me a story about you know how I got ... years ago his mother became sick\nAnd the intention was to basically have all of her assets past him\nWhen she was done with they owned a home or condo jointly\nAnd that condo ended up being sold and it started out where you know he kept the house that was his portion and used to have that what's his mother's portion to pay for care but as she was still living in still needed care and that money got depleted he like any good son ended up using his half of the portion and paid for her care and when she was gone\nBasically there was little to nothing that he actually inherited because it all went towards care\nAnd we see that happen frequently\nNow survivorship scenarios are similar because some times of the amount of shift that can happen it is often true that when you go from a two person household down to one person household there are\nCertain expenses that can be reduced you know you think about things like personal hygiene and food and maybe even transportation and stuff like\nThat that may be reduced but a lot of the court expenses like property taxes or renter mortgages utilities things that are just kind of more budget items sometimes car payments or\nDebt servicing or whatever it might be just because you go from two individuals to one individual those expenses may not drop precipitously there may be a little reduction but they may not move significantly enough\nTo where you can just absorb the reduction in income\nIn those cases if you're not able to change how much money you're pulling out of your various investments to cover the income gap\nThat's where people end up with maybe an unsustainable withdrawal rate where you know potentially there were only withdrawing three to five percent\nOf the money out of their investment accounts but now in order just to make ends meet their withdrawing seven or eight or nine percent\nIn in a number of years that money is gone and they're now in a situation that they never thought they would be it so when you talk about survivorship scenarios really what you're trying to do is you're trying to force the weather and out that could happen\nYou're trying to assess early on\nWhen both of their spouses are living what the implications could be from an income standpoint\nIf one of the spouses were to produce the other one and some of those situations you'll find that you know what the income gap would be too large to overcome just based off the remaining ... and it really wouldn't be a good solution to have life insurance to help cover those\nDifferences and in that instance sometimes it makes sense now when you start talking about what type of insurance people often should carry into retirement this is where it really does very you know there's a lot of people out there that tend to subscribe to either you know buy term and invested their friends who are they believe wholeheartedly and permanent life insurance\nI find that when you were looking at life insurance and retirement though term insurance often times doesn't really work because\nAnd depending on where you live that process could literally be ... if not a year or longer meaning that you just may not have readily accept you manage just be able to pull it in and do whatever you need to as soon as you need to do it and same thing with investments accounts also it may be very clear cut either through T. O. D. user but a fishery designations or will or\nWhatever it might be where the assets is supposed to go\nBut most financial institutions are going to have a legal team that's going to want to review documentation make sure that they're doing their due diligence and doing things appropriately before they simply just turned funds over to you and if you're trying to settle things and and pay people off and make arrangements\nCall it and the first couple of weeks or so you may not really have access\nTo that person's of state and in some instances having what's called a final expense policy were just having any type of life insurance that's enough of a bridge gap to help you be able to do things that you need to do while you're waiting on other access to fund can sometimes just logistically make things a little bit easier and sometimes people often miss\nThat there is a logistical processor it would just\nAspect to try to manage some of these pieces also it's not simply just what ends up on paper and the last piece that I kind of want to mention is utilizing life insurance for what's called a dynamic withdrawal right\nWe've talked many times on this show about the fact that in retirement one of the biggest risk that people have something called sequence of return risk so we all know market risk is which is simply that you know what goes up can also go down\nIn that we don't really know when it could happen\nBut in a sense when I'm investing in stocks and and other types of things that are maybe not contractually obligated up utilizing risk as my methodology for being able to generate a return so I'm willing to take that risk however in retirement when you're taking money out of an asset pool\nWhere even when you're in the accumulation phase one of the things that people often miss is that the losses are typically more impactful than the games so\nYou know if I'm thinking about a law that I think we talked about maybe a week or two ago Bush's do simple numbers will talk about a hundred thousand dollar portfolio and let's talk about you know twenty percent gain and a twenty percent laws will oftentimes it seems like they are equal in magnitude because we think about them is occurring\nEither one or the other meaning that if I'm at a hundred thousand that I go up twenty percent I gained twenty thousand if I'm at a hundred thousand that I go down twenty percent I lost twenty thousand so they say\nBut any time you take those returns and you make them see Quinn show me and I go up twenty than down twenty or I go down twenty than up Twenty one of the things you quickly find is that the losses have a much more profound impact the gains\nFor example if I have a hundred thousand dollars when I go up twenty percent of now with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars if I go down twenty percent of now at Ninety six thousand dollars\nSame thing if I'm at a hundred thousand and I go down twenty percent I'm at eighty thousand dollars if I didn't go up twenty percent again about Ninety six thousand dollars so one of the things you notice that the losses are much more impactful than the games\nIn retirement this creates a problem called sequence of return risk which basically means that the exact order that the returns happens actually creates certain risks at a portfolio whether or not you run out of money there's\nBeen a lot of studies that have been talked about the ability to have a non correlating asset which simply means something that's not going to move based off the stock market\nLike life insurance often many times that you can pull from during down years so if I had a hundred thousand dollars in investments but I also had a hundred thousand dollars in cash value in life insurance\nIf I was able to leave my investments that they could rebound in down years in pool from this other outside class like life insurance it actually greatly increases the amount of cash flow I can get out of my ass at all many people don't realize those but there's been countless studies now I think that are pretty much proven\nThat the ability to use a dynamic withdrawal rate where I can pull money from different income sources depending on what's happening in the market could actually greatly increase how much cash it's safe for me to take out of these investments and I think that's the place where sometimes life insurance can make sense in retirement as well you know in that sense not having all your eggs in one basket\nSo rather than simply being invested only in mutual funds and stocks in his change treated funds and bond funds being able to have a multitude of different asset classes\nThat gives you a greater flexibility and retirement can be really helpful also so that's all the time we have for the show today and you know hopefully this conversation real life insurance would helpful for you at least in helping you to start to assess whether or not you're in a situation where life insurance could be helpful in retirement continue to tune in each week\nAnd we're going to keep talking about different aspects of retirement\nPlanning to try to help you be more mindful with your money\nTo tune in next week

the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week where he'd gone to obtain documentation necessary for his upcoming wedding\nWhile the White House seems to be taking a wait and see approach to the

pretty blurring red lines that were about to see you have people on one side of this line like ... who was killed people around the globe we do know is whether or not this instance falls on what side of that line\nCBS News State Department report are currently Edwards says the administration seems to be taking a cautious approach in part because if you try to the Saudi kingdom\nAnd critics let's say that the president is already on taking some pressure off of the kingdom and Saudi Arabia and saying that if even if they didn't do this we're still going to continue doing\nBusiness with them a senator on the health things that they shouldn't be a reason to stop those a commitment so we have made it to Saudi Arabia it's a hundred and ten\nBillion dollars that the Saudis are buying in terms of US military equipment so that is a lot of money and the president is arguing listen I don't want to jeopardize the business that's happening between the U.S companies and Saudi Arabia\nBecause other countries are going to come in and fill that void like China\nAnd Russia but at this point the question as well if it is proven that Saudi Arabia\nIs to fault did actually murder Jamal ... show gay shouldn't vis a commitment that military agreement that sale a be in jeopardy and that's what senators are arguing but the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House is approaching the show because compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a good can act um in terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence that as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have\nWhat you know it's an interesting time because the economy is growing and in fact is growing at a nice clip probably for all twenty eight team will see somewhere around three percent GDP and that would be the best and a bunch of years but\nAs a result of that stronger growth\nWhat we're also seeing is that interest rates are rising and actually quite common that when an economy strengthens we're no longer the emergency zero percent levels and we know that the Federal Reserve had already started to raise interest rates as early in the end of twenty fifth\nSo what does that mean as interest rates go up and the economy is strengthening it means that the cost of borrowing rises back and go from anything from a\nCredit card an auto loan mortgage a corporate bond that accompany borrowing money all of that gets more expensive and the fear that we started to see this week was one that was a I Would classify as a very classic investor fear what if interest rates go up\nBy so much that they not that economic growth\nEnd at the exact same time considering that the stock market so well especially in the last three years or so what would it mean for me to just take some of my money out of the stock market and wrote take that into the relative safety of the bond market and that\nKind of the the yin yang of what's going on in the marketplace right now\nAnd so what you have is you have some analysts saying look I mean interest rate rises as you point out uh can happen in an economy like this it's not the end of the world we can move on on the other hand you've got the president who is saying [noise]\nUm I don't really like what the fed is doing at this point I Wish they'd slow it down and uh so you've got to at least on the surface different messages happening there\nI think that that the president is missing a very good opportunity to actually re the Federal Reserve and don't forget\nThis Federal Reserve is essentially comprised of most of the people at least you know who are on the Federal Reserve board including the chairman are of the president\nAnd I think instead of saying oh the feds moving too fast what I think he should be saying is\nIf the fed doing a smart thing because the economy is growing wages are starting to ride this is the lowest unemployment rate it's forty nine years in the bed really smart like investors you know wake up to see that in fact\nThis kind of an economy can absorb higher interest rate I think that that would be much more credible message and one that economists could actually get behind instead of rolling their eyes and saying it's not normal for a president to call his bed chair look up\nAnd is always long term investors or you know just to keep the blinders on if you're looking forward\nWell it's funny I got a question from a radio listener and who said I'm retiring at the end of the year I'm sixty six years old\nI presume that I should do something and my response was you know it's

the studio with Stephanie stroke\nA Stephanie is founder and co director of music and pot luck\nAn organization dedicated to nursing the community by presenting cultural programs to support community agencies and that's why markets here actually we we ran into mark ... the reason all this is happening today is because of good people at angelic organics learning center\nWho had their a harvest moon dinner several weeks ago and Peggy and I were part of the committee the honorary committee or so I got to just relax and have\nDinner and a go walk out by the lake in the great music and unfortunately he was stuck inside playing in entertaining people but you like\nDoing that with the wonderful event my goodness and uh what what a stroke of luck to come into contact with that group or one of the board members of his off and on a student of\nMine and so he uh he he made the connection and uh it was just a beautiful evening and are you how long have you been teaching music\nUm I've been teaching at the old town school folk music now for\n[laughter] thirty one yeah yeah well\nI've been playing softball longer than that so there you know uh yeah and we and I don't think we set it on air I think we were talking on Facebook Live before we actually went on to mark and I know each other from softball days with the Chicago theater so I'm all league and uh ... what I asked him off air was\nHow how does a guy who who makes his living playing musical instruments with his fingers go out and play sixteen inch softball when he met a I mean I I Know people who have fingers or turn sideways because of that game\nYeah are you okay uh I'm Better [laughter] yeah it got him you know when your kid you play ball and and and uh and then you get a little older and your your brain sees the ball in your brain says they'll get in your body says let's talk [laughter] but it was fun I Love\nLove the game and love the people are on our team and it was it was a fun not remember which team urine I'm an it was um no\nI don't remember the name of it and it was a I enjoy that and uh\nAnd I should mention to people on the other in other parts of the country who are listening to this and there are some because we're we're in various cities around the country a lot of you have no idea what sixteen inch softball is that there's a big soccer and you don't wear a Mitt to play it delete it well but that's the one thing that change in the\nTheater league is women are now allowed to use this myth which is really fair because their hands are smaller generally yeah and uh it really even up the game and it's and it's a lot more fun it was that way yeah so if you take a ball the wrong way um first of all you either spraying it or your break it or you just move it sideways and you know\nI've watched people just pop pop their finger back out after a while oh yeah yeah there's a lot there's a few hours there so that's that's the whole sixteen inch softball culture but the other culture we want to talk about is ... ... ... which is the second year a\nYes or stepping in and tell us tell us tell us first of all a little bit about music a potluck snow let's go to folk Tobar\nOkay well as some friends and I were talking to a presidential election and folks for can do you want me to get together and we were trying to figure out a way to bring people together and you\nAnd some comfort in each other and so we um we talked about music and at that time I'm Mark was posting on Facebook about sing along he was performing at\nIn Wisconsin I think and so I sent him an email and asked if you'd be interested in helping us out what the thing along and that is our first event started and we just decided to keep going with it\nAnd it's for a great cause you're you're helping folks who need food get access to food tell me about some of the organizations you're working for\nSo I'm One of the foundation of principles of our organization is not only do we bring people together a for musical performances and first thing along but we also always have to tambourine\nNo matter what your politics are that song speak to people\nWe could use Woody Guthrie right now we could use ... right now though I guess you have to pick up the mantle\nMode where we all have to pick it up right and yeah and and and and I love it but you're harmony on on the cards here we are in a talk show radio and yet\nInstantaneously we've we've made harmony and and and there was a man named ... who was the founder of the old town school we became friends late in his life and on two different separate occasions when struck he said to me and Pete Seeger said almost the exact same\nThing to me he said never underestimate the power of bringing harmony in the world\nIt's here and it's and it goes on and it goes on and it goes on and\nIn a in in that that's the very essence of what we're trying to create with our community programs and and we decided a long time ago and not try something for a thousand feet concert hall we wanted and living room we wanted in social settings\nAnd then and then little taverns like you're doing next weekend and benefiting people who who are not benefited\nFrom the stock market or the NASDAQ and and what they watch those numbers go up as I Do and actually that bears no relationship to my world I don't know what that means that that you might as well be speaking a foreign language because I don't understand it does not compute Broncos I Know what people\nWhat is happening to people in our country and how they are suffering and we need to step up and change that\nYeah it's been in in in you know the the reality is is I I Can't fix it and you can't fix it but we can all identify what's the opportunity that we can go in and help some things help someone make a small change and and and so I think this is really the future\nOf of folk music in living rooms living room music and community knew that kids is the new musical revolution and and we try to we try to put our programs in places where people already go and instead of having them\nCome to a theater or something people are already at the boats cafe it's very popular spot and then on on October Thirteen were doing that\nAnd and again if you want more information about folk Tobar fast next October twelve and Thirteen such next weekend a friday and Saturday or go to my website might know about dot net\nOr you can also a\n... well just go there 'cause you've got the links you get around paper check you have to it's it's all there Stephanie I Want you to have a couple words before we finish this up because you deal with these people on an everyday level as well so um maybe talk a little bit about the power of of music and community to change\nLives well we've seen it first\nWhen we bring music it at a park or foreign food pantry or to housing forward on our ... our homeless shelter dinners\nIt's kind of amazing how it transforms face and it helps people to feel at ease and what you were speaking about before I think its population is just generally overlooked in definitely under supported\nAnd if there's anything that we can do to help people feel at ease that says this is what it does for them\nAnd we you know we have other organizations on the show and talk to them and none of them ever comes on and say it says well it's it's just it's great because the number of people needing food and shelter and help is really drastically declining I never hear that know what I hear as it's\nGoing up and it's always going up in ... that set [laughter] that's right and and I wasn't very profound but it is it's the it's the truth\nAnd Stephanie by the way it is on the board of the old park river for food pantry and her colleague that the back of\nA you know the president of the word of the board and our other friend lives deal or is it is our quartet of people who make up music and pot luck and I'll tell you what\nI'm going to have you pick up that guitar before we get outta here 'cause\nThese three women are hard to keep up with let me tell you how do they have a vision they get things done and\nI was an I'm an only important to you because

a long story the bottom line is we can now communicate with Dr homes and ...\nHi Jack pumpkin it from the wizard of Oz of course and catch the ball jak from everything that we got\nMakes perfect sense to me All right so has it well and the way that we're able to ... you know contact Sherlock Holmes and Watson is because we were able to send your iPhone dug back in time so Sherlock Holmes has that we have another phone here and that's how we're able to Skype with them how\nTo research Sherlock Holmes ... this is Dr Watson and I'm the gentleman is controlling the cell phone this guy if you heard

one stars in his directed by Clinton Eastwood who spoke to retire like five years ago it was his last movie where he started I forget which one that was\nAnd he said okay I'm not going to start in movies anymore but he continued to make movies and you know he just said Fifteen Seventeen to Paris earlier this year and he did solely last year and you know he's done some crazy stuff\nBut he he keeps doing their share of farewell tour and and now he's starring in another movie which is fine I mean good for him you know work until you're keel over man that's great and I think he has he blows hot and cold for me I think some of his movies are great and some aren't this one it's still up in the air this could be\nA good one that could not be generally when he's ... he's pretty good in his own movies when he doesn't catch some self but even then I think in some way I thought it was a fantastic film and he didn't start\nBut this looks like a grand to Reno on the road [laughter] so I don't know this one looks it looks very Clint Eastwood I I just I just want to go to have to see before actually get any sort of excitement about it I guess the next one I Want to talk about pet

back to back guys at the movies with Kevin car let's continue on with the movie\nWith goose bumps to haunted Halloween\nA group of kids find an unpublished manuscripts by RL Stein which opens and brings polite a real Halloween\nSurvey of miles from where [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is the sequel obviously the goose bumps which came out I think three years ago started Jack Black as a fictionalized version of RL Stein who is of course the horror writer who wrote the goose bumps series and the fear street series is actually from Columbus ohio although I don't think you wrote in these in Columbus I think he moved to New York relatively\nEarly in his career but he's a hometown boy you know good old Columbus ohio and the writers James server and are all fine there you go after we got\nAny weights I I thought the first to goose bumps was kind of fun and cute and it was at a time where somebody wasn't doing well could lose right around the time of their big hack and it was a big hit for Sonia wasn't a mass of movie\nYou know it wasn't like what you might be ended up turning out to be just last Christmas but it was a nice little modest hit that did well in kids liked it and I thought it was a fun little movie I thought it was a neat way of\nYou know a goofy as as the ones that have these books open up and do things out I I I thought it worked for for that kind of a story and surprising that it took so long to do with sequel I think it's been three years\nWhich used to be the standard\nTime that it would take to do is equal you know back in the seventies and eighties unless you had them in a pipeline like the you know real cheap auto friday the thirteenth movies nowadays usually you can green lighted sequel sometimes at green like sequels before the first one even comes out and then if they don't do well they just quietly turn off that green light\nBut this one has Jack Black and they actually kept him out of the marketing from what I understand\nAnd I think that was to avoid any confusion with the house with a clock and its walls and it's also looks like it shot very similarly from in cinematography standpoint it's not like one has a very different look I mean a hundred Halloween goose bumps looks very much like it was like they just took the same\nLighting team and cinematographer from one movie to the next so I understand why they while the dial back Jack Black and the trailers\nThis is mostly about the kids and teenagers it in a very sort of safe up you know Disney or Nickelodeon type of teenager where you know it's a very PG movie and\nThere's nothing terribly unique about the film it does feel like it's a bit of a re trend of the first one because you have the the books coming to light\nOnly instead of it being just the general horrible to specifically about Halloween which I think is actually going to get this one a little bit more legs as we go forward pass theatrical release and even pass on video\nThat's the kind of movie like hocus pocus where you're going to see it showing up in kids' television programming like a you know when they did the even though it's not a Disney movie if Disney Channel and the future starts running these\nMultiple Halloween marathons you might see this movie show up in there as well\nBecause it's it's it's directly related to Halloween if the perennial favorite and it has the horror element to it it has jak lemons that come to light that has which has been bats and goblins and goals and monsters and and yeah they are rushing from a book in sort of the\nCGI flurry of male tremendous but it still has the element to it and that's what makes it fun\nI took my son who's ten and I went with me I think we're I must have been when he was seven to go see the first goose bumps movie I liked that he was highly anticipating that movie he was bugging me about it for the screening for a while and so I took him to see it and he did he had a lot of fun doing it if\nYou know it's nothing unique that's the thing about this movie I I I found most interesting 'cause I remember after I got done watching it I was like\nWell there's nothing that's really like lasting impression that it doesn't make me feel like I I really need to remember eight on it or think about as much as it didn't have a whole lot of different stuff in it but it had all the elements you needed\nIn a way it's kind of a cliche\n... it's followed the same beach you'd expecting them in a movie like hocus pocus aren't scared stupid which I pointed out several weeks ago\nThose are central to the same movie where kids are somewhat accidentally unleashing something onto a small town and then they have to vanquish it and that's essentially what going on here so it feels like it very much fits in line with those films\nIn a in a treat following as a real thing as opposed to a Scooby Doo mystery where they have to pull the mask off of some evil real estate developer who's going to get away with it if it wasn't for you get\nThe ultimate leave this was a cute little movie it's it's what I can see myself watching it with my kid or then later on my grandchildren on a on a yearly basis or in what I like to watch movies or or harder the movies in the month of October so I'm going to have to say goose bumps two hundred dollar wean rock ... well actually\nYou're listening to fat guy at the movies with Kevin Garnett or let's talk now about bad times at the ... the patrons out of out of the way desert motel or not all but they seem to be [noise]\nFirst time around you have the option to this day and I look out for him for Nevada\nAlways want to say in a honeymoon [laughter] even though I'm not currently I'm On [noise]\nThere's not a place for\nThis [laughter]\nThis is written and directed by drew Goddard who did the film cabin in the woods which is I think what he's\nNot what he's most known for I think new throw his credit's out they're going to be known as one of the the screenwriter for the Martian\nBut cabin in the woods he directed which was a de construction of the horror genre and this isn't a horror movie this is a suspense thriller it actually feels like kind of one of those in the crime\nFor the Spiderman theories or venom this may have been something that that had a lot of excitement attached to it it may wane and of course they're going to do is equal we'll see how well the sequel to stay because I think we have that same problem with the amazing Spider Man when they made that with Andrew Garfield\nIt did very well but then when they made the sequel it didn't increase in the numbers and it didn't do what the Marvel's cinematic universe movies did and build upon itself that's where a lot of these\nIndividual movies do well in other studios but they still have the longevity issue so we'll see what happened the venom in the long run and a star is born came with almost forty three million which is huge\nThis week those are probably going to repeat I don't know of a first man is going to have the immediate\nBox office I think that's going to have a lot like when they keep hearing about first man all the way for award season of goose bumps and el really all I think our algae gonna struggle a lot more with the FARC off than some people think it's just it's hard to categorize [noise]\nYou're listening to the fact that the movie with Kevin car that means it's time for the homeless in um around the spotlight\nThis week is on skyscraper Dwayne Johnson stars in some security experts trying to see his family from terrorists when their hotel skyscraper is set ablaze\nAnd just enjoying this very much selfish I remember going into our foreign policy is curious what do you think of a building the Berlin Wall is mostly bans building a moral built they've articles or give us every single safety literature ours are complaining\nAbout only have you brought them all and doors for them to a hundred and forty fourth one really knows how [noise]\nHow much you love and it's hard for a modern world not done as well but set on fire die hard meets the towering inferno\nAnd it has all the elements you'd expect from an action movie with Dwayne Johnson it totally work what's funny is the number is a weird little story that goes along with it from my perspective my mother goes out with her friends from church every Friday most of the time and go see the movie heads a group of women\nOf an advanced age I mean I'm forty seven you can do the calculations and figure out about how my mother isn't a lot of the other women did she goes to a from like Bill choir\nOr they're all around that same age and and they will go see movies they tend to like see like like popular movie but they will go see the the character studied a little bit more I knew a bunch of them wanted the stars born the other week\nBut at one point they apparently went and saw a skyscraper in the summer\nAnd two of the women walked out they were so just not offended by it but just bored by it they're like oh this is off let sleep and I always found that fascinating because if there's anything you would say a lot about skyscraper you can say it's cliche and silly and it's stupid I mean it pushes the buttons that it's supposed to pushing it works for an action movie\nBut there's nothing about skyscraper\nThat doesn't tell you exactly what the movie's about it there there are some movies where\nYou may not know exactly what the film was or the title might be a little misleading and you might find yourself in a movie you don't want to see\nI don't know how you would go the skyscraper and not get exactly what you would expect look at the poster Tim jumping from a crane to a to a skyscraper in in a covered box of the Blu ray it's him hanging dangling off\nA ledge is everything gunfire around them\nThis is exactly what the movie is promising\nAnd I don't know how my mother's friends from church thought it would be any different and you know why didn't they just not buy the ticket why did they say well you know might be an intimate character study of a family oh it's just a stupid action movie oh we're going to lead\nAnyway skyscraper I thought was fun I don't think you need anything more than a good fun action movie now and then and\nAnd I thought that this one worked as as an escape its\nFilm that you watch it on a friday night it's totally fine and if you get the Blu ray it has a whole bunch of bonus features like deleted scenes and extended scenes and ... other behind the scenes stuff and of course there's a\nCommentary track as well so there's plenty of stuff in there do to watch and dive into for you know a couple of hours after watching the movie ... and you know looks pretty cool I'm blurry so it's I'm going to have to say the skyscraper still kind of rock\nOther DVDs blurring out this week include hotel tranquil being a three and the trick or treat collectors edition just in time for Halloween [noise]\nThat is it for this week I Need to go when it comes back next week I'm going to be talking about the oath and the remake slash rebuilt slash equal of Halloween until then have a five time at the movie [noise]\nMake you would hear

Novato, California Hi there John\nHi Ken welcome thank you what's going on um well\nA little confused um we're traveling to Europe next month um my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\nG. P. N. app but when I'm using public why and I'm Wondering how important is that I haven't researched telling blurry I thought it was good has fat differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on the outside that\nAlright well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on the public why everything that you do it like traveling right through the airwaves okay uh-huh though if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com past whatever maybe is that anybody can just pluck that we're\nSo and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network and then they'll use all the sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to I've been traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out OK\nOkay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use when you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun\nOh yes I Can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app and to put up by the London museum oh and so when you're this is like the coolest thing you're going to totally love to buy\nWhen you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pickled daily square or whatever it may be is that you hold up your phone and it's augmented reality so you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you went to like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go through them which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France to make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right course song and you know if you could do a food toward any of these that it'd be great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so ah so you're right there are all these different VPN some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of as secure and it's a public company and this was the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to that it's over I commanded a comment that show picks but she can find it and that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit card that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app\nThat you need to get its called mobile passport you heard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else cut that out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back\n... there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right and they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security right and border patrol\nNow if you have mobile passport on your phone\nI guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line\nAnd sixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to get through in like three minutes\nOh my gosh I have to have\nYou have to do it it just had to do it and so and it's like one of these things before everybody knew how to get ... you know it's good to get pre ... but no but now everybody has pre check [laughter] so it's kind of like that same thing with this mobile passport and so\nWhen you get off the plane and ah when you land back in the state should look for a sign that says mobile passport here in Phoenix\nOr they actually didn't have a sign and I had to ask one of the border patrol agents like you know where's the mole passport and he's like oh that way you go I mean I went all the way to the left and when I got to the line there was one person in front of me so\nAgain mobile passport great out ah for anybody that's doing any type of international travel\nAre one of our great

answering phones here for a long time long if you have to say how many years Seventeen Seventeen known about sixteen years there's gonna be Seventeen then it's almost Seventy a long time we should probably\nTalk about you not being an intern anymore\nYou know what I'm going with it OK yeah less pressure\nI'm like you ... when I said Seventeen are no Ken [laughter] pretty rough [laughter] God Andrew dominant exaggerated [noise] so Eric yes or he wants to be able to non immensely put photos on the Internet\nAnd when someone normally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good ... you know what 'cause it sounds like revenge porn or should yeah it sounds like something shady yes uh but he has good reason he used to have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents\nTo be able to see what they look like\nThem alert to you okay I saw that headline that they pass code was zero zero\nZero zero zero zero correct six zero which you know that used to be [laughter]\nUntil ... when did you change it this morning I saw the headline [laughter]\nSo now it's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one close seven seven seven seven seven that far from over there ought to be a writer much art or the other thing that the Internet was criticizing Kanye West for tax wise was that he had a phone in a case [noise] yeah\nI work with the big deal about that it's not cool it's no longer cool to have your smartphone in a case\nSo who's saying that it's not a cooler these people that are ... are they like trust fund kids that are being because those of us that have to shell out ... you know a hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I don't want him to shatter if I drop and the criticism is is that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need the case on the back\nUnless you have a mold for you that's going to charge it there's no reason to have a ...\nWell that's what the Internet was it that can get another stupid okay here's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty get mine pick my black okay but the reason why it's pink it so that when I throw it into my black per se\nI can find well that's why if you got one like me I have a rose gold iPhone it'd be easy to find in my purse\nFew eyed guy with a roll of gold phone and the only I for some of blood bad I brought a case\nOn it anyway what does it matter so we were talking about Conyers password yes zero zero zero zero zero zero there was a call for everyone to try and hack his social media accounts so they wanted to use\nEmail addresses and log in and then just try the password password one two three because odds are that's what his past where this so then came out the stories about horrible pass for us to have and I learned something which surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter]\nI've never heard about password walking he never heard a password walking never\nThat's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter in your past or most\nPopular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are getting back to the top row and the bottom and you walk with your fingers across your\nThing and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose will go down three\nRight that they actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X.\nCause you to row and let me tell you something if you want to just look at that as a password you'd be like that the darn good password exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary not worried at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nUh some some a haiku you know a gang symbol almost you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords dogs do don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\n... what was your a second grade teacher his middle name\nA well that's wonderful\nTo to step verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... only use it for fantasy football to every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password 'cause it's been six months and they used it\nBut if I have an a Yahoo apple on my phone they send me a message through the apple and I can get in\nYeah and that's really the the odds yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we look at people who complain go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not\nTrying to set up security I'm going to tell you something now my space in Lincoln yes they both since two thousand sixteen if I have huge security breach\nOf in their website ... can you guys in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used in the morning and\nThen there's really a tough one I don't know if these two stories are connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde hair [laughter]\nMy space and linked him yeah just use it as their password but what's that Mustang that's probably and these are brands of so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy\nThat the brand ghettos again the brand okay but you can use the passwords get old age you're not using it for your skills that count [laughter]\n[laughter] okay so don't use LinkedIn as your Lincoln account password you know when it comes to entertainment I found this one pretty interesting the number one most popular entertainment password a favorite ... musician characters actors is actually Superman well number three flip to not do you have\nAny idea who slipped now I have no idea I thought maybe I'm just getting old and out of and now I don't even know what it is anybody here I think that they have a hard rock band is a slip knot you'll have to Google that's number three though poke\nYour mom was number two a star wars and Metallica\nDo you use popular words as your passwords or do you follow the ... which which my wife I told her about this year's ago we've been together a decade she uses the Kim commando work rule when it came to pass that is what I Do I still you know I come up with a sentence\nAnd and then I throw in like a a hash tag or question mark or ex which and then I make it unique for every site so let this way I don't have to use a password manager\nAnd I don't have to try to forget or you're trying to remember all these different passwords 'cause I have a hundred and thirty four different online accounts\nHow do you know the number I just want to count\nWealthy [laughter]\nWe had a gentleman here doing level one support and level to support and Tim you remember Tim grade okay attempts fabulous and a new off my password and so when Tim left even though I trust him\nIs that I had to change all of my past for a hundred and eighty four passwords man hundred and thirty four it wasn't that bad oh sorry yeah Dan I'm exaggerating\nOn the last one the last category\nPopular passwords for training team his emotions in check and we started out with something very sweet I Love you that's the most popular pets you know that's happy that the most popular emotional password okay then it takes and we could and violent turn number two and a few [laughter]\nNo [laughter] can you imagine typing that and every time okay that's not good for your psyche and that's not good for karma number three in the ... a word\nNumber for the F word again but instead of you it's all okay what a great society that we have isn't it and those are the most popular\nOh here what is that that was in at number ... number six is interesting trust\nNo one we are negative we are oh look at number eight I hate you that's one of them are here why did you say that that's to me but it's like we go from I Love you\nYou use a particular site to put together a photo but did you not yeah we used to fly you shutter flies and because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books there's a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nIn one of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and 'cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John re that I'm working with them work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form about those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you

apple watch now you might recall it was probably what was it eight or nine months ago when I was really excited about having an apple watch when you've got the three right I had a serious threat\nAnd you know both you and Mike or like my brother's right okay so you've seen me embrace technology and throw it away over the years so I was really super excited about having an apple watch\nAnd the first time I wore YouTube took that\nHow long were you where are we had the over under going yeah yeah okay and so ... what was that bad I think it was two and a half we take two weeks [laughter] and and then after two weeks that would be like ride out aid that stupid\nThing right so I took me under that you would not last two weeks which would be you know to ... shows right to Kim Kim managers and you'll be you'll be to buy a mile I think you ward maybe seven eight shows in a row and then it does appear\nBena tapered off a little bit right okay um because what was happening that I was getting like too much like like what am I step\nOne is my ... pm you know 'cause I can be a little obsessive compulsive what is the little OCD who ... who who would dare say that about I mean we were just upstairs and I am I I'm a little hungry sure and so we went up to the break room and what did I Do Michael's\nHere for the pizza but uh you I thought you were a guy thought holy cow Kim there's going to eat pizza and I was going to be higher insurance to hurt you open the box that she was just showing somebody where the ... took off so I went\nTo my house and then I got an apple blame ah I Know\nAnd it's really funny because I had to go get my annual checkup\nThis past week and so I was with my mail dock and I'm like oh look at my ... pm and this this and that is right and then showing them the app on your phone yeah your doctor yes okay and I'm like looks like sometimes you know it's forty for a good resting heart rate [laughter] what'd you say it's a ... is our eyes\nAnd she says she goes to bed at like an excellent rest resting heart rate\nAnd she said you know what your cholesterol is right now\nDo you know what your cholesterol no idea okay my ... years is no idea how can you really need it let me take them you guys need to know what your class\nAnd Scott Hi so uh we're good and you know it's a high because my doctor tells me to pick her medication everyone's high give me bills right well you have to have everything in your online portal oh yeah okay\nTim in young ville Louisiana\nEither him hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right here I'm like most of the ... to ... all along reputation management I guess my let them be like well with me the best\nAround that I can find for small medical office and also what I was looking at it the old or a I'm a software that you ... and then the F yelled at such an engine optimization half the goal would all fall ill\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\n[noise] well the problem with them or if it's obviously what most of us have as you know if you have as many good reviews go online to help you out a ... a bad review would they would balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people have the experience is usually doesn't go online and proposed the positive experience as they have what are you at your business so what I'm having here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to\nAdd up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do is find something for someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\nBut and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or were where is it so I'm Glad for all the medical school it's like health grade that car okay I'm bleeding they use excel\nOkay so okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nPhil anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you can you help on line and\nJust dropped somebody rep in there and I think over time see four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the other thing you can get let me finish the other thing you can do is with health\nGraves is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there are there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo so in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay and that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization\nAnd to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results that well right All right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now\nAnd it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per quick campaign\nSo somebody types in whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes\nMaybe pay ten cents for every click but you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff\nOn line okay\nDoes that make sense does it say um I I Do promote like customers or try to ask them to go on and put on a positive review for us\nTo get them to do it because they're like a should I Try to add a pad or something that's and that's and rank them then they can you do it here now\nYeah you put an eye pad right there exactly uh that's really smart\nAnd number you know and you could have a former they fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this this can you know this goes up to health grades or whatever it may be\nBut the other thing too is you can have a basket there a gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket\nOkay so we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left in Greek review for us and so and that that can be on that little card or that can be on the printed receive that\nCould be part of the email confirmation or the tax but that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points but you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive\nYou know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make it self better but ... and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times 'cause the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason that doesn't work in thirty days\nAnd want you to give me a call back and we'll go to the next level but I think you'll find that people will give you that review as long as you ask for and thank you again for your call or let's talk about one of our great sponsors I drive dot com and I always get\nI uh use my math but I don't use it that often I live in a small town and I just don't need it that often but I Will notice my battery will go down to

or a or a three fifty one or or uh you know or sixty four yeah there's just different things like that it could be an ... they're going to be\nEating that oil not leaking it most likely what as far as

you know it was about to rent it could be the same problem\nYou might have something different what it is worth checking into because we're aware that this could be things so there is a device here's a path to look at the path to look at under the hood there's a thing called an effort to see 'em a front control model you open the hood it's basically that fuse boxes on the driver's side fender\nThey fail and when they fail that's what controls racy compressor everything's running through that and you can lose\nThe compressor but it can also kick in and all that he is you would shut it off the compressor wouldn't work but the really would kick in now and then and engage that compressor and run the batteries that overnight and then when you drive down the road the compressor would not break when you tell us to turn on it wouldn't turn to rely on and run the AC hit and it just occurred like that overnight\nAnd the next day the batteries were didn't like what is going on and then we drove for a week no problem the batteries did not go dead but the compressor didn't work\nAnd then all of a sudden the compressor started working with the batteries went that every night it was stuck on all the time it turned out to be it was in that frontal control macho so how we diagnose it is we get the circuit diagrams and find out who I have any electricity\nVoltage coming out of that after you know to POWER UP that compressor and if we don't but we have a signal coming into it which we can read from our scanner and physically with a meter well we know we got something going on in the module and then with the vehicle off\nJust check this out when you turn your vehicle off and you know it's probably going to be dead the next day see if your AC compressors engaged if it's quick on and engaged even though it doesn't work it might be turned on when the keys off\nAnd I think when I answered this call on a hotline called it was similar I think I brought up the power train control module some of the front control module and all kinds of all that\nUh I wasn't there not being hands on I just do that there was a module\nThat we had a thing on Herman out at like ... it's a different which is a different module okay so I was wrong ... where are you listening to us in Texas\n... water Texas\nOh we love we bought our Texas I'm actually from Texas so I Know where I Know where that is that we've got a lot of listeners\nFrom down there it's uh we we appreciate all the interaction from sweetwater thank you for going\n... like a great place to live sweet place with eight six six five nine for for one five oh\nIf you're just joining us on this hour of the under the hood show you may be shocked to learn that Ross talked about Tesla earlier on that just checking in [noise] I actually saw some news that has changed ... related to test that so I wanted to bring it up\nHonda will take at stake and General Motors cruise unit I signed that memory and didn't read it as part of a new partnership to build an autonomous vehicle for large scale deployment to point seven billion dollar investment is that what I've read\nCrude CEO exactly ... said Wednesday in an interview on cheddar that this is a great deal on the path of deploying self driving cars at scale\nHe said that Honda's engineering expertise particularly in space efficient design is critical\nThe companies will work together to build an autonomous car from the ground up votes\nAnd unlike Google's way mobile unit of fleets of retro fitted ... in many wait wait a minute [laughter] a retro fitted SUVs and many vans and mission is to completely rethink what an automobile is when a driver isn't needed eat that that is on the street from me corporate speak\nOr he did not give a timeline for the rollout but this is the part this is the part that I found interesting in his I think going to be a major thing in mind the vehicle will be manufactured occur at GM plant\nAnd what they said was a partnership but this size between two giants shows the importance of scale and legacy manufacturers and tech startups Jackie proposition\nTesla has proven how difficult it can be be to produce the car from scratch without infrastructure in place or decades of assembly line experience GM and Honda have both they do so that's a\n... and that's what everybody keeps saying is that ... is is pushing the market it in an amazing way and there there was an article I I I caught the headline on when they got to be careful with headline teases now in days but uh the fact was that BMWs recognizing the pressure that\nYou know is being put on their midsize sedan by the by the model three or ... and it it's it's real\nThe but the the challenge for an upstart make or just like you said is that they could be innovative they can be pushing the boundaries\nBut they don't have that head start on actually having the facility to get it built and if the other manufacturers decide you know it's our turn to jump in all of a sudden the game just changed and they have to be so established to withstand that and\nNow everybody ate and water and what I've learned about I loved living in a pool by myself but everybody else gets it gets a lot harder to swim the ... river may be watching and seeing what\nWas going on while I was there to Tesla store and talking to some people that were a little more knowledgeable than me which was everybody was there at the store there are gearing up and they know that they're behind in production and they know they're a start up which when you look at ... or any car company that's I mean look there there quite a ways they ought to start now he works\nRight but they were they were a nobody I think it was they said it was two or three college kids that were coming up but it wasn't ... that came up with Tesla it was these college guys and then it was taken taken over\nSo as an electric car but they started with nothing and the brutal where they are and they're ... imagine arts guys if we decided we wanted to start up a bicycle company and compete which when ... no it's not going to happen so you start they've really made a mark\nBut one thing they did say they said no look\nOur plants are smaller\nAnd we're trying to do this right to get it the way we want but once we get there\nThey said their technology they have to build the cars once they get it to capacity is far beyond what the manufacturers have their like guys come on we can send a rocket to space and landed on a platform that's moving and the ocean I mean we can have a an entire plant that\nAssembled cars with less than a third of the moving parts so they go together quicker hundred percent with robots and work twenty four hours round the clock and quickly that if we ever hit that mark we can do it and I think the other manufacturers are going to follow suit hopefully they'll bring our carpet\nThough [laughter] if there are any a start up billionaires out there who want to buy a radio show yeah I mean not just put ... I mean if you would like to advertise on it but if you just want it and want us off [laughter] go shading point right let's take a quick break you're listening to the end of the show\nWe recently sat down with Greg zip Adelie competition director for Stewart hops racing as of today they've won five of the first eleven races for the twenty teens season Greg talked about the importance of the relationship with wicks filters\nYeah here and it's too hot we're fortunate to have a number of technical partners I mean obviously to perform at a level that that we need to do and what I mean by that is if we can align ourselves with um\nCompanies that can help us have an edge on the performance then we're better than our competitors and and for many years which has helped us design all kinds of filters a specially the air filters and do a phenomenal job\nAllowing us to package the maximum air filter size and our air boxes were always you know looking for that little bit of extra edge um so we're always looking at you know different police in different coughing and things from that nature and and and they're always there to help us an answer or\n'em maybe she really juice it up with the starting fluid\nWhich would be amazing ... do you go ... you could you could have hydro locked it if she was just pouring into like crazy but you do that stuff would evaporate evil it's built very\nCommon to damage starters on those you might even just pull the starter off and take a look at it because the starters are really easy to get off of those cars take it off and look at the teeth and see I mean I damaged one of my Model T I had the spark advance little too far on it when I was first put back together and\nIt uh it backfired and broke the broke the star on the fix that so\nIt's common we've had them in our shop where we tried to crank up one cars weren't starting in the back fired when we're trying to get him going and when they backfire all of a sudden the starter changes from one found ... different\nDid you have a backfire\nNo no I I I was very surprised that it wasn't starting actually he's normally with our story floor you know you put a little bit that in there it's going to start right up\nAnd I was turning it over quite a little bit and I was told her you know don't just hold that was during floor just kind of sports a little bit of time and I was really surprised that had actually started up because this week before it had started walled off for me to drive it to the to the shed and so\nIt was you know is that an engine modest you did you did already wide nothing happened is the engine modified or is it stock\nI Believe the internal their stock of course has a different carburetor you know it's pretty up ... ... sure I'll covers things like that but the base engine self as stock it believe\nIs that enjoy a night that engine should be a free wheeling engine even if a valve got hung up its roasted shouldn't impact piston\nI'm that's what just makes me I guess I just start from scratch again and and your next step might be to just pull the spark plugs out and turn it over by hand if you feel anything and I wouldn't discount the starter thing yet because it's it's\n... it's possible Justin hold on a second I Want to talk about it like you're not really there for a second if this were you Shannon\nArrests and you had to pick your wife to either in you're expecting it just to start right up if you hit the target flowed right would you have your wife in the car trying to start it or would you have are under the hood with\nStarted foot wouldn't want to do I I have done this before and I usually have her inside cranking while I'm under the hood on an older car working the throttle in the same time so all you have to do is turn the key or I'll just get myself a screwdriver and hit the ...\nNot a good idea I uh I Would never crank okay\nYou'd have her in the house while you were under the hood with a screwdriver when\nShe came on crank ... oh yeah and I didn't I don't have I didn't know now you know and it might turn into a\nWhy didn't you stop cranking that's I Know what I did hear hear you I imagine it and ending poorly no matter what but I'd rather have\nHer in their ... ruining it because I wouldn't be my father didn't catch on fire thought there was a little bit of an art to the spray you know it's a it's a drive up and then he said you gotta give it up\nSo you know I\nWas there a thought but ... but uh as to who would do what they are just\nYou know there was the idea is I'm always afraid that you're

Wisconsin needs to lock him up especially on third down\nLet's talk about the keys from Michigan a lot has been made up of games they haven't won but they're Twenty one for him it's building under Jim ... what are the key is for them tonight\nWell upstate defensively kind of a common theme here but be ready to make a play on the football in the past and get even though Alex ... broke his throat just two interceptions this year there will be a couple of chances for the defense to get ... get their hands on the ball he threw Fifteen picks a year ago and even last week against ... Nebraska\nWhere he broke with a little bit off the mark you will miss some passes high and he doesn't throw with a ton of velocity so there will be chances but you've got to make a play on the fence when that opportunity\nIs there and then finally you got to slow down Jonathan Taylor just simple as that he's been over a hundred yards at every game this year and he ran for over a hundred yards against Michigan last year in Madison in fact right\nHe's been held under a hundred yards rushing just four times and it's Nineteen game career at Wisconsin he's got a big experience off at the blind in front of a pullback pie dance you name it it's going to be a huge challenge\nFor this defense but it's time to show college football why the Wolverine to have the number one ranked total deepened since six best against the wrong they're getting a great challenge against the number one running back in college football they've got a slowdown Johnathan\nTell you what a great match up you're seeing Taylor what he can do a good bit Michigan the fact that it stopped everybody so far this year huge challenge on both sides here that I had a big game and the big said Michigan and what Scott

chance for Wisconsin coming on the road to do their best to get the up this crowd out of the game and the best way to do that is the start running the football pick up first found\nThat will keep the noise to a minimum but if they get backed up behind the change that's when you are going to hear a hundred and ten thousand plus start to scream and it's going to be really difficult for them to execute it especially if they're trying to make the adjustment that the line of scrimmage that's where you're going to see what type of veteran leadership is on the scene\nNo surprise they sold out
