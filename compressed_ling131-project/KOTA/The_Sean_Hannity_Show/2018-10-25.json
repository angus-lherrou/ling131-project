[noise]\nSean Hannity\nNew York city said and as for anything new work showing as information about any of the instruments this week in New York we don't underestimate the difference even one person can make\nGeorge our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision\nAnd I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nNew York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are striking it on every day they're not just this week our detectives nine electric constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution hotel you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today\nI have a match pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD to each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone and more forced from professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public reserves have\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives in the works and and visit New York city who make the safest large city the United states even safer Mr Mayor thank you for\nAnything of any substance comes out the only thing they have said as the bombs had a powder meaning some type of explosive powder and broken glass\nUh which would mean the maximum amount of damage and shrapnel that ... that should they have gone off none of them had gone off usually in the mail bomb like that you would think if somebody opens it that's when they're going to realize that\nThat's the moment usually would detonate a thank God none of that has happened thank God I'm all packages\nOr were lifted apparently Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the return address thankfully none exploded no one was injured and this full scale federal local investigation is to hunt down wherever those maniac is that would be responsible for such things you know it is um I don't care who it is\nYou know there is no place in this society for this type of violence\nThese types of threats this intimidation it should have no place in politics for our country\nYou know this this evil ... we're talking about and I wanted act of terrorism here\nIt's a I've having lived through some of this myself I Know how horrible it is my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that is involved in this it's just wrong I Want these guys put in jail for as long as possible\nAnd it shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever\nSupport this horrible act or this type of violence on the property as the president condemn that yesterday\nUm nobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do\nWhen they can politicize something you know this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump and they go to Fox News them talk radio and it goes on from there\nMeanwhile we have heard the plate some of it in the last hour play some of it later in the program today the most incendiary over the top out of control statements that have now been going on for weeks and weeks\nThese mobs literally showing up getting in the faces taking their marching orders of Spartacus and people like Maxine Waters that crater crowded follow them into department stores gas stations grocery stores you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore wow\nHey is that that how it is what they said to Mitch McConnell and his wife this weekend I'm you know you\nLook at the ... you're rushed to politicize this in the silence has been deafening\nThe last number of weeks as all of this has been ... you know unfolding before our eyes Sarah Sanders and our family and bonding and secretary Nielsen Ted Cruz had Cruz and his wife and of course Mitch McConnell and his wife the guy got violent in the restaurant over the weekend\nAnd everything to lawmakers punched in Minnesota\nAnd you have a Boulder thrown through Kevin McCarthy store as a matter of fact Republican or Democrat does it it's got to stop and we saw what happened in the Kavanaugh hearings what was Rand Paul saying well as I say I say we better just get the general public out of the halls of Congress because it's not safe anymore\nAs ... and those cases left wing activists you know getting in people's faces bidding at Lindsey Graham\nIn a rush to pin blame on the mail bomb some extreme is you know it's not just fringe Web sites and communities on Facebook but you know Soros Obama the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio on Fox News for over a decade\nWell if this idiot bend Collins that NBC News that ever bothered listening to my show\nWhen the White House and I have multiple examples of when I set it remember that guy walked into the White House through the front door one day and they only went up to the residence and Brock Obama's president I said this is insanity we've gotta protect our president we've got to protect our politicians isn't political that Senate attack an assault on the United states\nWhile but the president says fake news while they are fake news most of them\nEvery second every minute every hour every day there's Trump paid that is all over television\nYou know this was an abject idiot and by the way they are not alone little insinuations by fake news CNN fake news conspiracy TV MS and ABC NBC CBS the same thing\nWe've been calling for calm we've been condemning the mobs that have been confronting politicians that was a matter of their left or right\nWhere the ones when a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate Republican lawmakers on the baseball field nearly killing somebody that is a friend of mine's house majority whip Steve's Greece I said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for this had nothing to do with that\nAnd that's that's but that's the type of logic I even said boy who's the other way
