I took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and they also review the rights of the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters in the book\nWill then you bring a dose of real science to the picture to your friend and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just gotta look a little bit harder\nUm the journal article a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm a narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\n... um entanglement and non locality and see how the electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on now but I'm a lot of great research is out there just a matter of finding\nWhat have you concluded up to date brand new to what the ... experience might be for someone a real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of the ghost they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to counter it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a ... internal ... electrical stuff going on a I'm a ... but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think a majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine history\nAnd what do you think causes the ... one of the hill\nI think there's a ... in my in my view I take them more by side based on new on goes ...\n... so that's a sigh is basically a um\nA pull up at the extra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that a lot of goes Lee encountered that happen out there on the base of it has to do with um ... or ... I'm sort of a um\n... coming in from being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment than other people on my main theories and the book\nGo over um ... what I call the Taliban that distress signals and sort of how they play a role in those encounters so I really think the people's telepathy is a real I was a real important part of a ghost when you know\nHow important then is the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um\nI I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of the\nCatalysts ... everything that's happening so when I say that\n... you know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghosts encountered that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind I write I'm a death ... a life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma something like that is the catalyst for these goes way encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that I'm ... I'm a ...\nI think uh when you have the events when you have this drama I think it it\nSort of ... there's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is a\nBig emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening they're gonna have all these emotions are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these\n... bio energetic shifts that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to to send a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and a great a classic example of this is the crisis abolition ... All right so we probably heard of these ... this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my ...\nAnd then she says you know I'm a I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt passed away right over\nTime that I had that and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying or somehow she says oh I'm In a Taliban distressing they'll things to me ... ... and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of something\nAs you say some people do get these experience and why not\n... ... ... ... well I I think it actually comes down to something I'm I'm a pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity ... All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like\nA chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is a\nUm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population are\nSo if you think about this as humans menu we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways but\nThe physical environment affect certain people more than others\nAnd this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunction um there is a researcher out there Michael ... our ... who categorizing environmentally sensitive people and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have\nA long standing allergies chronic pain for tea migraines fibromyalgia and just that\nOver sensitivity to light sound like you're a city and smell\nMore than maybe me and you do so I could walk in the room and be fine other people could walk into the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place they all bashes [laughter] so these environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population\nUm there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is that these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's ex federal magnetic field more than the general population in other words they have a better antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAnd they're picking up on things and and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up or the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experienced paranormal phenomenon it it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental somebody\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also signed saying these people are having ... counters why is that ... and then that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people Brandon realized how sensitive they are to picking up these things I mean did they know they get it\nI I think they do it and then when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is ... you know not only are do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but\nIt's genetics so their mom to deal with her dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most ...\n... you know genetic diseases or or whatnot just kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment and I'm\nJust by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rashes ... um they can do the under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity for these types of people just experienced a different world and and believe me they know how it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\n... ... you know you talked about some of the reality television shows brands and buy a criticism of them because they always seem that they have to have some kind of goes Leon tone or\nBecause of television and you know they don't want to do there's thirty minute or one hour program and not have anything happen show looks like they create these things and I think that kind of hurts the credibility of some of these uh episodes don't you\nThousand members now seven hundred and twenty five people shy free to sign up give it a try paranormal the dotcom paranormal the dot com indefinitely download in your app store the free promotional data that's available mile two she'll take advantage of that\nThat just put in Peru normal day to the will pop up in your store so here's something like ...
