into it I went and uh like I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all want to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from where we were\nThere and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than divide rods\nAnd it was just weird and I felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck is about like a bar full of empires or something\nI hear exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or a\nCapital slaughter bright and up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago\nI Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean this was an old bag and see the bar you know and I went in there with them and to this\nPlace

comfortable right\nOh well I've known him because I work for them um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they checked me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out so we're
