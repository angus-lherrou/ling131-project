it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought to surf girls Hussein\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirits I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know should tell my father she is normal um but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved with say in a matter of physical and spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that he is you know what Marlene\n... this has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio [noise]\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family was better than another member [noise]\n[noise]\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight years so\nI never really knew her and um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted\nIn her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDo they ever passed down stories from one to the others up to you could carry through\n[noise]\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was ... maybe\n... maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know ... ... that was her true self she was very unique about what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England new goes project Maureen since two thousand and one would use a\n... a well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to you know work and do a um ... you know a special court for class as he talks\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable ... on ...\n... you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose ... doing on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would look at 'em but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get a you go out and you look for things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nGo to one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help and there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd um people were getting a little freaked out and they need help ... so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually worked because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house ... ... [noise]\n[noise] well off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy you\nKnow ... ...\n... um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent ... would we find something active going on at the time but we are big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [laughter]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might be experienced you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in a while as a good reason why you don't see it on\n... so if you say how many people I said good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street [noise]\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain in their life\nWhat did you conclude is above ... ... maybe ... a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right now so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know and love one another okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where ... you know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there are different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then they might see a spirit walk by and all these plant just ...\nHi as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door to door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot struck from the stairs or you know all these\nHow she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes and rolled 'em and spoil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and walk in the potatoes underneath on you know on the plane itself\nSo ... what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees\nOf paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice mhm ... doesn't mean that you're going to have a spirit that a hundred percent you know wonderful and nice much not all fun and games [noise]\nI don't know I mean you think about it you have someone who is [noise] let's say a not a very evil person what if you have a person like a murderer that's in prison for and they pass ... do they immediately growing I mean ... ... you know there's just a [noise]\nA lot of things can be aware of um when people go out and investigate and realizing that it's it's not all just fluffy bunny\n... have you concluded Maureen ... hill but hell does exist\n[noise] you know I personally don't believe I mean I was brought up Catholic um sometimes I Believe if there\nIs a hell in the afterlife it's because we created ourselves [noise] um I don't believe that uh you know there is necessarily a hell no\n... interesting you know what drugs you why do you keep investing [noise]\nI don't I I investigate because I don't feel\nI can stop sometimes you know I over the years um I've\nWhen you're a lawyer addicted to it\nYou know not addicted to it but [noise] to me when I'm at\nYou know investigating a lotta times I'll use energy and expend energy when I'm doing that um and if I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right now it's like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of I work on computers um and occasionally when I Would go to those fans of time and not actually use that energy\nWould tend to when I fly a lot of my electronic\n... or ... to forward to your book more a ghost chronicles and he of course is the author wolves ... polices what a great investigators use\nOh
