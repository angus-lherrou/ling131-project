Texas super food complete organic\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the cold but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experimented with the ideas and the\nMethods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity to write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly\nIn the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on ah\nWhat do you think a miracle is match\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and currents that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles of my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start\nReading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization with an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can define a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nAnd the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there was a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that a positive people do but that something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes\nThat much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my message is also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of other\n... before you came on and he said he was in Israel and of course great Mentalist news telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland in over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved and the guy missed it or something like\nThat okay now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've been expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I even go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said you drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true [laughter]\nKnow ... Michel delayed astronaut when he was on our program was talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost that you couldn't find it and he was telling us\nAbout it and out of the sky just out of nowhere decorative painting and it was the tight class but that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the the part that class into the the pointed at end of it\nYeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed her I mean it's amazing these villages for that [laughter]\nAmazing but back to these miracles we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share a miracle stories with you rich if we can but back to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark into march but that'd be good but\nYou know people dabble in the dark side they curse other people they put exes on other people in in a lot of cases does things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\nWill it represents something that's in a you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum and my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are\nUsing your thoughts through with bell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some\nEffect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition teaches that the only way that you can project\nA negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense when we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook temple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there's an esoteric\nAnd a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\n... well that's absolutely sure now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory\nOf positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists are cyclical researched quantum theorized that we have made the determination over the past eight years that time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting\nEvents all the time from across in and send it to the possibilities to I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances with an exclusively focused and the motive Lee charged\nThought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement in the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize\nThat we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality has never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have\nRecorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was it had it on George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing there\nI Would think you are going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they have they did have a few good so\nThey really did they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter]\nAnd I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality\nI said no he said well we'd like to\nGet a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the you interested and I said of course I'm interested and I told him the story of how month before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose from linear time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we\nThink it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seem to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nThe dot com actually were nine hundred and Fifteen shy of eighty thousand people so go ahead and sign up it's free to sign up
