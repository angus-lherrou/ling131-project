Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with\nDean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other cancers out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward a you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have\nIncredible stories that I just that ah it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown unless somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are than calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I I think once more people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nOr with Bruce old up so high in his latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had been just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in God Knows what they believe in ... to tell me about\nThat yeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a\nThey told me that experience is believing and believing his experience so this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried\nTo every once in a while put it on the back burner because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this as the with this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it and in the last couple of years that's\nThat has been the the the point at which the do the\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very I I was four but I Would and we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island and we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months it was a winter time\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and ... and like I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen in the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little nap\nAnd it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to uncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me\nAnd my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then\nIn in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling in between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and uh\nIt I felt like I did it with an angelic presence and it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and\nAnd and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry or boat\nOr there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nWhere does science fit into this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah we were to science spin it as well\nI I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked all awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating or just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum\nWorld so by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model a ... ... how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on a TV almost with that model might be\nWell the idea is that a\n... that I okay I'll I'll look at it this way so\nIf in the morning I take these I I call them a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my\nOne way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical dean but if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave\nMore than I Am a a a a particle beams\nAnd I and my my location\nIs is not just in one place so I I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that uh that uh\nI I I'm not in any one location and and uh and and that's kinda how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how\nHow this works and the and the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book where we experienced a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think that's where it comes into you know a different dimensions I think that we we might die in that and to kill or think that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen\nUh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't and uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next ... but at the same time that we're doing that there is this\nLine wrinkle froze the import it's called instantly aid and went to two minutes\nSee dramatic changes the your look

I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candlelight in the window\nAnd I just momentarily look in there she was she was very scary looking person that she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all the direction yeah we had this\nShe had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window up and\nShe was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran into my brother's garage and I and\nI and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well later that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site I at the foot of my\n... the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a call him a fire that was coming up out of the floor and I I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream and so I Pinched My ...\nBy slap myself and no I was awake in this column fire then spread all over me and an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an ark and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd then if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking and all these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts that it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seems like it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nImmediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well you know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said well you know I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Rapid City", "day": "30"}
