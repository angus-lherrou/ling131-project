seem to enjoy it\nAnd um and pretty much that that you know I mean I think we all have a responsibility to have a voice in this life uh especially if it's for the good you know what I mean if you're a lawyer appreciate the coast to coast you know I've been in and inside for a long\nTime well thank you and I'm when I'm On my desk at work I have a little I part and one of my abs is coasting are here why does he listening to [laughter]\n... you know people are always are getting an ear what is that what are you listening to over there and uh I I tell them so I tried to promote the show as much as I can\nWell that's good I think he is a tough being a blogger of religion and spirituality and also a believer that there's a creature out there we are called ...\nNo not at all to me um as as far as a big foot goes as far as you are voters go as far as angels go you can\nPick the topic um I Believe all of these things for me for the both of my faith you look at the universe is just a vast and wonder is thing and ah even our own\nAnd it continues to amazing ... with the discovery is being made day in and day out and if you just think about something like the dinosaurs for a moment\nOr if it wasn't for one guy who is out there looking around and places where your normal person does not seeing a bone hanging out of a hillside and we wouldn't really know about them but we know from even books like Michael ... book forbid knock allergy\nThere have been a people of civilizations or animal life here will be for us\nAnd yet when given the account biblical you from Adam and Eve on what's so to me it's a test of faith or will you believe what I've given you from this point forward in spite of knowing what we were going to discover after the fact\nSpeaking of books and I got from you too low you some books just on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me originals\nWell here's what happened in Georgia in this kind of humor is um when you produce that had contacted me uh I had an order in a four foot they're actually made to order on Amazon\nAnd I had given all of the copies out I had and I had what I mean I I had it in order in ... and that's it I have nothing to send George so I said I could make up some copies or and put them in folders and send them out there and she said oh that'll be fine\nOn as I was telling Tom tonight I said Tom oh my God I think I think bill sent me his original book tour he's got it wrong\nI I I Know no have I have no fear have no fear the didn't want to send it back no no that's okay and as a matter of fact I'm probably within the next few days I'll have some and I'm going to send them out to you and the a and the crew to ah pass them around and ah enjoy them what\nIs your instincts tell you based on your work the big foot might be because this is what I hear I hear it could be an extraterrestrial it could be physical creature it could be an eat it could be dimensional we hear all kinds of things what do you think\nWell [noise] ah\nMy my own personal theories are on that or to fold a number one in the physical realm\nThis is a creation this is a creature that out there of how many of them are there we don't know nobody knows but based on the fact that they leave prints from both the hands in the seat\nA according to some testimonies they bleed having been shot\nA and they die as we're getting into a little later on a which to me makes him a living breathing entity like any other creature a B that greater small on the planet\nA I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart any way that they do exist and that people have every walk of life are encountering\nThem uh having said that uh we\nWill get into a little story later that out of hand picked for the coast audience a and I have a couple of them are that do involve a UFO phenomena\nAnd my take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on here are the natural okay the UFO suit soon I think I think this too I think one's almost like an imposter and one is the real deal\nHas anybody reportedly ever been hurt by one of these creatures physically hurt\nWell or not to my knowledge I don't have I have people that had been a scared out of their wits I have people that had been rushed by these things are but not attacked\nI'm\nYou know things of this nature they ah they seem to be creatures of habit a I Will say this getting back to human or non human dimensional on non dimensional or\nAre you here again and again and it's not just me but many people\nUh have heard from individuals that when they saw this thing\nBasically was grinning at me a a like a demon mhm in other words some people have sightings and they say you know well\nUh it had a blank face a I couldn't see it's tea uh it had no lips and other people describe it as having this evil grim as and getting the sense of imminent danger\nOr a as the creature was nearing them or staring them down from a position in the woods with him right now at home so it's it's um\nIt's it's really a mixed bag as far as that goes you know and that's totally a based on what\nPeople are willing to tell you would not tell you is it more human or more a plane in your opinion well to me uh it stands alone or I'm not in the camp that this is a uh see I think it's the missing link\nWell I mean you know it's it's a missing link up some kind in that we're not used to seeing this type of thing\nYou know we're familiar with ... ah lions and tigers and bears and human beings yeah and um you know when people encounter this thing they're not quite sure what to make out of it uh I've had a number of people telling me that\nYou know it's not humid it's not a human hybrid either it's simply a big foot\nAnd I think the ah the relationship between something walking on two legs having to lawns hands which fingers attach you know when I hear a highs knows mouth years\nJust makes us think more human because of the way it's walking around and the way or the way we ... but uh\nYeah I don't I don't really think it's a hybrid I think it is simply its own entity it's very odd totally unique and because of the lack of sightings or the the few that happens in and then you also have to consider George\nHow many of these things are actually being being seen and how many are being told to us\nThere's a stigma surrounding these creatures with people don't want to talk about it they don't want to give their name they prefer if you didn't tell them the exact location where this this happened to them\nUh you know they're at work they don't want to mention it I mean you know these are real problems when it comes to a ass attaining a evidence pertaining to the creatures you know people don't want to speak and\nI put inside the cover my book if you've seen something say something\nAnd uh another thing that's worthy talking about a ... uh I think some people misunderstand that I did a little disclaimer inside the cover and it was kind of a play on words\nBut uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these boards or worker fiction\nAnd the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world everything about big foot is
