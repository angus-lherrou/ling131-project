[noise]\nThat's the guy that pretends to respect women in order to get laid\nAnd then you have the uh well\nI guess that's it [noise]\nThe hardest thing about being gay by far coming out to your parents there's nothing more nerve wracking them that and an Indian culture there is a tradition where parents arranged their kids marriages my parents had an arranged marriage I talked to one benefit of coming out to my mother\nWould be that she wouldn't push that on me anymore but she is I dedicated woman [noise]\nJust last week she posted an ad on Craig's list that read my son twenty four years

[noise]\n[laughter]\nI'm Kate Clinton in while I can joke about the political state of our country it's no laughing matter would Congress could do to our civil rights and informed community is a strong community that's why I'm inviting you to tune into the station to hear this way out\nWhere they will make your heartbeat faster but first\nIf you think we're dress the way\nWhich a lot I had the choice\nIn\nSeveral years ago a rash of highly publicized square teen suicides but tons of media coverage to the issue even though the headlines had been quiet the horrifying situation continues and the queer youth broadcasters of out casting overtime want to see the problem at best now\nThis is casting overtime a special feature from El casting Public Radio's algae BQ youth program by I'm drew the youth participant in how castings main studio in Westchester County New York on this edition I talk with fellow outcasts or Lucas about algae be GQ youth suicide and education\nFocusing on the tragic story of a nine year old\nBoy who took his own life on August twenty thirty two thousand Eighteen ... miles killed himself he was nine years old and had come out as gay a few days before committing suicide\nThe first person he came out to what's his mom and she affirmed her love for him he proceeded to come out to his classmates who bullied him relentlessly he committed suicide just four days after coming back to school and telling his classmates that he was gay\nThis bullying was nothing new his mother had been in contact with the schools administration in the past about bullying that he had experienced this all happened in Colorado a fairly liberal state and yet the message that the children carry with them is that being gay is inherently bad\nSchools and the government do not nearly enough to make sure that algae be tiki children are accepted a ... a possible reason for this ingrained lack of knowledge about algae BTC people as media balancing\nThe media often bring in so called family organizations which are primarily anti\nOf algae BTU issues some of these family groups have been designated as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center which has a long and distinguished history of identifying hate groups the issue is that these anti LGBT youth groups spread misinformation that has no basis in fact\nThis balancing is the same as bringing a member of the KKK onto a talk show to oppose a black civil rights activist they provide no valid viewpoints and only served a convoluted conversation surrounding algae BTU people this can ultimately lead to children being taught that homosexuality is negative if they know what it is at all\nOn top of that the message being sent out by influential people is awesome negative for example the office of the president should be a beacon to guide the nation and all the fares especially ethical ones\nBut Donald Trump serves as a beacon for all those who hold homophobic beliefs not only accepting but also encouraging the message that the algae Beatty cue community is different and should be excluded\nHis administration has dismantled supports to provide equal healthcare tells you BTU people and has opposed supporting algae be teaching students\nEducation and messaging that being gay is not something negative are necessary for a better tomorrow but this is not usually taught in school or at all Lucas would you like to tell us about your experience with algae be teach you used in school\nYes I Would love to\nI went to elementary school in California and for the most part I Would say we are relatively homogenous and caring and loving group but somewhere through elementary school there was this one kid that was different we weren't sure what was different about him but he was definitely not the same as everyone else and people started making fun of him and bullying him\nAnd eventually someone learned the word gay and started calling him the word game and throughout this whole period we're learn nothing from the teachers are that administration about\nThe algae BTU community or what the word gay men in general we just assumed it meant something bad and soon the whole grade and picked up on it we weren't only calling that kid gate but if something was bad would call like that tree is gate which just meant\nThat tree is bad\nI eventually found out what the word gay and just more about the algae ... community not from the school but from my mom when I went home she explained that it's just someone that likes on from the same gender at that point", "year": "2018",
