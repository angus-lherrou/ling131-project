generally if these measures pass they allow the cities and in some cases counties to start collecting additional taxes on cannabis related businesses KLW elections coordinator Angela Johnston has more Hi Angela Hi\nSo how many places have a cannabis tax on their ballot and why well there are lots of this November and I think they're close to a dozen in cities all over the state and also in the bay area\nSome are called cannabis taxes you might see candidates tax ... be called marijuana taxes and they're in San Francisco Oakland Santa Clara even half moon bay have one in Union City yes there's one in Union City\nAnd they all have to do with taxing what is now legal cannabis businesses but location to location there but different and the reason they're all on the ballot really has to do with the candidates legalization that happened two years ago so that was ... sixty four that we voted on\nAnd part of what we voted on was allowing you know some holidays to determine how they want it to tax candidates locally\nWhen we voted the props sixty four\nSupporters promised a net ... billion dollars in tax revenue eventually and January was the beginning of that commercial sail around the state and legal cannabis as tax quite heavily here in California you already pay state\nAnd local sales and excise tax fees and regulation taxes cultivation taxes so these new taxes on the ballot are in addition\nAnd I should say that from January to June so the first half of the year the state chicken a hundred and thirty four million dollars and that for six months in a revenue from campus taxes the forecasts was about a hundred and Seventy four million so\nIt's a little bit of a shortfall but we'll see how that goes in these additional taxes would be bringing in more money for cities okay so let's dig in tell us about some of these crops okay so will first mention San Francisco's that's profit the\nAlready if you run a candidate business in San Francisco with state and city and just general sales tax you have about a tax rate of twenty five percent so the San Francisco board of supervisors wants to add another tax on cannabis businesses operating in the city or selling candidate scuds in San Francisco even if they were made somewhere else\nIt would affect businesses making over five hundred thousand dollars a year and they'd be taxed up to five percent and the new tax would not come into full effect actually until twenty Twenty one why why not now\nWell some cannabis businesses aren't super happy about this measure so they pushed for the delayed start they think it'll hurt their business because\nThey'll have to increase prices and they worry that that will push buyers to go to the black market where they can just buy cheaper marijuana right so is there any other opposition\nRitchie Greenberg he's head of the San Francisco Republican Party and the one official opposition and the voter's guide I spoke with him on the phone recently and he gave me a few other reasons he's not voting for the measure\nOne is that he says it's misleading\nThe supporters same money will go towards education equity programs training education of the candidates workforce and enforcement as city cannabis permitting but Greenberg points out that it will go towards the general fund and he says general funds can't be earmarked for specific things he also says that the measure gives super\nPalmer's businesses whether they have to do with candidates are not so those are just businesses that\nExist outside of San Francisco but sell their goods and the city so it's not necessarily focus just on campus he says that's a little too vague\nA supervisor I'm Leah ... Cohen introduced property and she points out that other municipalities already tax cannabis businesses at a higher rate than what she's proposing like Oakland okay to us speaking of Oakland why don't you tell us about what's going on there right\nNow in addition to the state taxes Oakland has one of the highest local taxes on campus and California five percent for medical and ten percent for recreational and in both cases that taxes applied to every part of the supply chain cultivation manufacturing delivery testing and retail all of the set all live separately\nBut candidates growers and retailers argue they're struggling to survive with these high taxes so the measure on Oakland's ballot is really unique and it's called measured V.\nIt'll give the city council the authority to lower candidates taxes and it would bar them from increasing taxes above that current rate which is five for medical ten for recreational\nMeasure V. is backed by Oakland's cannabis Regulatory Commission or in Alameda County treasurer\nAnd no one has publicly oppose the measure so far okay so those are cities what about counties that are voting on cannabis taxes right so if you live in Contra Costa county will be voting on measures are and that would allow the county to tax cannabis businesses in unincorporated areas of Contra Costa county ones that aren't in a city [laughter]\nAnd then there are also smaller cities across the bay area that have local candidates tax like\nWell there are many ah like you said Union City there and Morgan hill Santa Clara Mountain View Emeryville\nI'll talk about half moon bay though you actually can't buy canvas in town there but there are delivery services and if you live there you'll be voting on whether you want to tax cannabis delivery businesses that deliver in town [noise]\nAngela is our elections coordinator and environment reporter to for more election coverage you can go to K.
