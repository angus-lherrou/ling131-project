A. L. W. muse contact culture and connection from around the bay area I'm hanging out by law\nLiving shaft one Oakland seat for mayor four years ago since then the city has experienced some major changes from a rising homelessness to attack and real estate boom plus a multiple NBA championships\nNow mayor shop is campaigning for reelection and she's up against nine other candidates KLW Janine Darden met up with mayor Libby chef in a peculiar place they spoke about why the mayor wants to keep leading the city\nI Am I Am in the in the back of mayor Libby chefs mini van [laughter]\nBecause other places to echo yeah we're we're going to interview so you're in a position where you know this money is coming in you know with tech industries but I've also people suffering on the street how do you work with both of those communities\nNo one deserves to spend a single night on the street and I'm very clear with people these are not drifters these are Oakland her ... these are people who have lived in our city for generations\nAnd to be surrounded by so much wealth and that stark contrast of more and more people living on our sidewalks is offensive it is a moral outrage\nOkay so there was a building that's eight thousand dollars a month to rent 'em the units are and I know you said that you know you support market rate um market rates when it comes to to real estate however I Know some people felt like who are struggling um they felt some kind of way about when you said that I'm I'm very\nClear that my\nNumber one work every day is fighting displacement\nAnd market rate housing is one of several strategies to do just that\nBecause the people who are moving into Oakland they can afford the price the new housing and if we don't build it for them they are pushing out people who are here now out of the existing housing we've got to expand the supply of housing and because now we've got impact seats\nWe've got a more protections we've passed bonds for affordable housing\nOr some of that construction is actually generating either affordable units in the building itself or\nA payment into our affordable housing trust fund to build more housing elsewhere\nSo the ... knows um it was approved for the ... to be built by the Henry J Kaiser centered what is that going to look like in the in the near future and listen next steps after that okay\nSo the ... are an emergency intervention is the fastest most cost effective way we have figured out to get people off of the streets and into safety and services I've been so\nTouched um by what I've heard from the tough said cabin community members themselves about how much comfort or it's given them to move into this improved situation with the knowledge that this is a temporary stop\nOn a road to self sufficiency and permanent housing\nHere we're talking about the streets another issue is dumping I Know you said when I saw us Allan temple debate you say you talk to ... she didn't have the bandwidth to prosecute people because of dumping is just so there's\nHave you done do you have a a block party and can you talk about that is or not like a block party block party but [laughter] they called\nThe bulky block party we are approaching the problem with the traditional three ease which is increasing the eradication we've\nExpanded are dumping crew so we're picking up more faster for not waiting for people to call to complain we know where the hot spots are and we're just going to pick them up\nWe're increasing enforcement we have four cameras outlaw it's been a little disappointing they haven't caught more people and um believe me when I called the ...\nDistrict attorney and told her that her staff had said that they don't have the bandwidth to prosecute the cases that we brought them as a result of those cameras or she said that she will make sure that the bandwidth is found so she [laughter]\nShe herself had a reaction to a that news um and then finally it's education and we've got to do more to make sure people know that this is unacceptable behavior I Believe that the service model we have with\nWaste management is not working and that's why we brought the dumped the the the bulky block parties\nTo Oakland and they've been usually successful um three Saturdays\nWhere Oakland there's could come between nine and one with as much junk is they wanted and not worry and how many cubic feet it was or whether it had two or three tires or how many mattresses just bring whatever you've got we help you unloaded we don't charge you a sense\nAnd you can be on your merry way we had more than one thousand Oakland her take us up on that offer\nI Want to talk about art so what have you done and what do you hope to do is reelected to keep more artist here because a lot of artist I now have left because they can't afford to live here\nOakland isn't all come without its artists\nSo one of the things that I think I'm I've been good at as mayor is hustling other people's money and I was very pleased to bring several million dollars in philanthropic money to really preserve the artist community in Oakland\n\n[noise]\nThis class parents I'm hanging out by about now will head to California state prison salon in Vacaville where KLW started a new radio program called I'm cost\nStories from Solano state prison\nOne of the students there had a life sentence without the chance at parole he's also an internationally recognized poet spoon Jackson has won multiple award for his poetry and even collaborated with singer Awni to Frank out let's hear an excerpt from Stu in Jackson Paula I'm a real mess\nRuined his each were on meat and does not waver know dress on occurrence he has the staying power of the sun ... walks only in his own shoes\nHere's how spoon thinks about poetry\nPoetry is a way of uh\nAround your soul and hard to speak\nYour life to speak your feelings to speak your love your likes and dislikes by getting the eye\nOut of the way the selfish and they found a way because in order to write poetry you got to be infuse from the news is I Believe in uh everybody or not published it because they put some lines down on a piece of paper\nPoetry it comes from a place of of pure and it's the place where as a child used to be able to go to that you lost as you grew up [noise]\nTwo of the producers in our class interviewed student about his poetry we'll start with Steve drown and when you add their time together soon and Steve have spent more than eight decades and various president\nWhat first got you into writing\nI started writing and I just do everybody away my poetry and so since that day I was about Nineteen eighty six I think it was ever start writing since that report comes natural to organic ...\nHow do you feel that creative writing weather as a poet playwright whatever how do you feel that benefits\nUs as ...\nUh when I taught creative writing up the new Folsom fortune correction\nI had this contact with professors that doing the streets and they wanted to exchange the day was kind of like a highbrow neighborhoods in colleges and we had our students exchange letters\nAnd a lot of them are kids that they didn't even think we were human basic prisoners write poetry in bloom away so I think knowing that we embrace them arts that that that same thing they do\nAny of them to see us as human beings and I think that's what's important about or be you in prison or out on the streets\nOh we can exchange places and still be human\nRight right and I I think that happens with are riding also happens when we do our theater the ability to create art in whatever form it is that is the best therapy that we can have\nA rock and a ... of\nPart of me\n\nSometimes I just like\nBeing with her friends sharing silence few sprinkles water\nBlack bird nesting in may and every sprinkle\nEvery like birth\nThe universe\nJoe Kirk and now they're after and classmates in our radio program I still about his technique\nYou have a method that you use when doing your poetry or no I just whatever inspires me beer Iraq a\nTree or I don't know anything that's inspirational mountains can inspire me something someone say\nOr dream I Love dreams and I think of Carl young Sigmund Freud and Adler and and I think of a lot of the poets from the past like Pablo Neruda\nLangston Hughes my Angelo in Shakespeare they inspire me a lot of my inspiration come from dead poet's do you ever feel that you are different than everybody else\nWell everybody's different everybody different than everybody else nobody sees things exactly the same that's the beauty and being humid that you know we all connected on one level but at the same time we are individuals and\nAnd in that in reality we learn how to be ourselves in that enhances their whole human population because you know I don't think any\nHumans I think it was ... somebody said deliberately choose to do something that would harm themselves they choose it because they think that would make their lives better\nOr can you go ahead and tell me what type of books do you like to read a I Love all kinds of reading and I started a reading of philosophy a psychology and sociology when I first came to prison and I wanted to\nMake myself a educated so that I could to\nHelp people avoid coming to prison because when I came I was sitting in the courtroom listening to the\nDistrict attorney talk about me like\nI wasn't a human being using words that I didn't understand and so I told myself from that point on I Would study the dictionary and\nTake all like English and language in college classes I can and high school classes to make sure that no person ever talks above my head again just by using birds I did not understand [noise]\n\nAre just so everybody knows that you're you are now a prisoner that means life without the possibility of parole correct yeah do you ever lose hope you ever\nKnow only hope\nThis people lose hope [noise] uh\nNo but what the thing is uh\nLet me see I'll Try to us with this call me see if I could remember\nI cannot go on like this\nBut I Will go on on and on even when on is\nOff something is stirring in my soul wanting to burst out like a hot spring in the desert won't come out\nAnd I don't know what it is in a moment of hope it's a poem I Hope it's a song something fast like you rip Biddy something wise and funny like air Stephanie's something deep like Langston Hughes so deep in the seas were no light goes I Know what it is\nRight my way out of prison bailout redemption once but now the condemnation I cannot\nGo on but I Will go on and on and on even went on becomes\nOff ... garlic and said there are letting some life was go home\nSo am I have known for a lifetime and that is a good thing\nThat there's no end in sight for me and I don't know any more where to go to get stripped to go on I don't know where to go to leave this sadness in pain how my heart sing again in my spirits or again\nEverywhere I look there's a big sign that says no no forgiveness no love no hope no second chance no dreams no romance\nI cannot gone but are we going on and on even went on becomes off\nI have nowhere to go nowhere\nThat says yes
