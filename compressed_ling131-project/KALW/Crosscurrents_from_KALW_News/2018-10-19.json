I mean these contacts and culture and connection from around the bay area I'm hanging up on\nThe fight over housing in the bay area who should build it and where it should be bailed it turned out and it's surprising place the elections for the board of directors of bart four\nSeats on that board contested in the upcoming November election KLW transportation reporter Eli weren't Chester says bart's elections this year are about whether the agency should build more housing near its station or stay focused on running the trains on time he lives with me here in Studio ...\nAre you ready to hear about the elections for the bart board of directors share you don't do that but\nI'm guessing this is something you don't usually pay a lot of attention to the bart board race in my in my right whole lot okay well by the end of this conversation I Am going to make you care ... that are that are not challenge All right let's go out and\nSell the basics first what is the bart board what do they even do okay bart board views are the people who run part you can basically think bart is being like a company with a general manager who reports for the board of directors except in this case that the board of directors are elected by we the people\nOkay so then how does that work is there like a director elected from each city that bar it goes\nThrough if only it were that simple no it is super weird uh-huh there are nine different bark districts each one representing a couple of stations in the area is kind of a round that station but it doesn't always line up with cities and some of the districts are shaped in odd ways honestly I don't know the history of why\nBut basically the point of their nine districts and four of them have contested races for bart directors this year okay so where are those races Lou okay like I said the the district boundaries are really hard to describe but\nYou might have a bart candidate on your ballot if you live in San Francisco Oakland Antioch Pittsburgh conquered Alameda San Leandro Fremont Union City Newark or\nHayward okay that's a lot of ... ah but say you're like me I live in Union City I get to vote in this election but I'm not a regular part writer why should I care about this very\nWell your tax dollars help pay for bart and your car is stuck on the road with other people who decided that part is not for them that day for whatever reason\nBut besides that this year's race is unusual and important because it's shaping up to be not just about transit but also about housing why housing goes where in the bay area everything is about housing ...\nOkay but more specifically this year there's a new and controversial law in California that lets bart override local zoning rules to build on the property is that it owns near bart stations Mm\nOkay controversy now you have my ... [laughter]\nThis this law this was put forward by assembly member David Hsu from San Francisco and his idea was we need more housing and where we need it most is by transit center so people don't have to drive as far and pollute as much of\nThat law give us bart the power to build higher and more densely on its property and the local rules might otherwise allow mhm it also requires that some of that housing be affordable\nSo for a lot of housing advocates and environmentalist the law's a good thing but other people see it as part and making a power grab given the runaround to city governments to local control to potentially build higher or more densely than the people living in that city actually wants\nThe question is how much property to bart really have to build on it doesn't seem like it's a line that\nMaybe more than you think bart owns two hundred and fifty acres of land that the agency says could be developed mostly on existing parking lots and that's not counting the land that bart has already re developed or is planning on developing\nSo what's an example of a place that bar has already done that kind of free development probably the best example is the fruit veil transit\nVillage near the fruit fail station ... I did I was out of there and it's like a farmer's market to Zach late as a farmer's market this plaza there's housing retail offices even a charter school on the site\nUm ended parking garage was built next to it to replace last parking mhm I'm bart's done a lot of this kind of development in recent years most of it not as glamorous as as the fruit failed transit village maybe it's just apartments or something\nBut all that development is becoming an important funding source for part because they can attract\nMoney from developers to improve the stations and then they also attract new writers to the system when they build housing and commercial stuff near the station\nBut it gets bart into this kind of new territory of being not just the transit agency but also a regional urban planning agency yeah\nSo now in the bart board elections the battle lines are generally between two camps you have one group of candidates a lot of whom have backgrounds in urban planning who want bart to build lots of new housing and other developments\nAnd then there's this other group that wants to focus on kind of the bread and butter issues like safety cleanliness making the trains run on time\nOkay so let's talk about those candidates who are the candidates and who which Saturday on\nOkay so you've got four races starting with district eight that's in San Francisco you have four front runners Janice Lee is endorsed by the housing group ... action and she's really a proponent of using the new law for bart to build affordable housing\nAnother candidate Melanie Nutter has an urban planning background and she also wants to make development a priority mhm Jonathan lions who works in city government he's more in the middle he wants to build housing but it's not one of his top priorities\nFor you and bright study for a policy perspective it shows what you know in pure ugly the value\nOf diversity in health care\nSo that was the main question absolutely out of your study which is actually called does diversity matter for help absolutely and there is yes it does and we can quantify the impact and then we feel that the impact as largely due to\nCommunication and we saw that there was this\nIncrease in especially invasive healthcare services what solutions ... surely or what's next for you know there is how do you\nCounteract discrimination\n[noise] how do you impact policy in regulations\nHow do you increase just the volume of potential pre ... ... students that can go through this pipeline and be available to become a clinicians of color [noise]\n...
