J. Kenny hand says it's also not entirely a bad thing that we've had such market volatility\nThere was a while there were felt like the or just buying because they just kept going up now I think it makes people will be a bit more selective in their investment\nAll three of the major U.S stock market indices turned\nUp four hundred and one points to twenty four thousand Ninety four ... roast two hundred and nine points standard and Poor's five hundred closed up forty nine point this is NPR\nWelcome back to cross turns from KLW news context of culture and connection from around the area\nForm of Richmond city councilmember Giovanni ... Bek holes and democratic organizer Buffy Wicks are competing to represent California's fifteenth assembly district\nThat includes Berkeley Emeryville parts of Oakland and Richmond and San Pablo they're running to replace Tony Thurmond who's now a candidate for state superintendent of public instruction\nEarlier this month two weeks and ... had the chance to speak to some of their potential voters and candidates forum in Berkeley hosted by the league of women voters KLW election coordinator Angela Johnston has more\nHundreds of people from students to retirees gathered in Berkeley community theater and very quickly the candidates got to one of the biggest issues of their campaigns housing it's clear ... and ... both have a desire to solve the housing crisis where there are differences show is how to solve it\nTake for instance proposition ten that's a measure on the state ballot which would repeal the Costa Hawkins rental Housing Act\nIn order to allow cities to expand their own rent control laws\nThat goes as a strong supporter of prop ten\nI absolutely one hundred percent support\nWe have not [noise]\nContinue to displace\nOur community members in this in in our district\nAnd that's why I we ... we\nHave to build more affordable housing\nPlease vote for ... this November\nBecause the rent too damn high wakes agrees on the high rent but not on supporting prop tent\nI've spoken to folks who build affordable housing\nUm affordable housing experts um the N. double ACP the building trades labor unions and they're all in opposition to proposition ten because they are concerned that this will exacerbate or housing crisis by halting the construction of new homes and we desperately need new new homes in California\nWe have a severe shortage so if you talk to folks that build affordable housing they have these concerns\nInstead wakes wants to increase the rent or tax credit from sixty dollars to six hundred dollars she also spoke about creating a legal Defense Fund for renters who are facing unfair and fiction [noise]\nAnother main campaign point for both candidates as health care both support a single payer health care system in California a system financed by taxes that would cover the cost of a central health care for all residents but how do they differ\nIt's more a question about when the current system could change which doesn't believe that President Trump would give California the funds needed to enact a single payer system anytime soon\nSo in the meantime let's make sure our system here works well let's put a public option on the exchange that way and a twenty twenty environment we can then actually work with the federal government and create a single payer system here so that everyone can have the access and health care that they deserve and the state\nThat goes reminded the audience that she worked as a mental health specialist for Contra Costa county for Eighteen years and she insisted on working to get a single payer health care system as soon as possible\nI Will move towards a Medicare for all single payer health care system\nThat takes profit out of out of the service of of people uh that's why I Believe that at in California we can do that but until until that happens there are certain things that we can do right now\nLike she says ensuring that done\n... and the hospitals and implementing what she calls a quote publicly funded care coordination system unquote between providers fighting to protect existing health coverage [noise]\nThen education took the stage that goes once a moratorium on new charter schools in order to spend more money on public schools\nWe've seen how a of of the for profit education system is ruining and sucking the life blood out of our public school systems and that's why I Will be a champion so fully fund our public schools\nAgain which disagrees instead of an actual moratorium she wants to make sure people get a better understanding of how the resources on charter schools are being spent\nNow I Will never ... parents were sending their kids are charters you know parents are making difficult decisions I'm a parent I understand\nBut we've got to have heart count ability and transparency around our charter schools\nBoth candidates also want to tackle funding problems in the higher education system that goes and wakes agree on closing what they call it the commercial loophole and proposition Thirteen this future reform could allow the state to receive more tax dollars from commercial properties by assessing them at their current market value and to put that money towards education\nWe subsidize it by taxing the rich\nWe close the tax loophole and prop Thirteen and and as I said earlier that's how we do it that's how we get the resources that we deserve we as working people in California we are the ones that created the well California is the fifth largest economy in the world with the largest concentration of billionaires\nWe will workers created that will\nAnd we deserve to have the resources that they would bring forward and and so again that's how we fund universal preschool that's how we fund universal tuition free public colleges for all of our students in California\nWe chose to focus on the racial inequality and education system\nKids of color have less access to good early childhood care\nRight in starts even before that a mothers of color have less access to prenatal care and then we see those racial inequities exist within our education system all the way through to the point that UC Berkeley last class only was only three percent African\nIt's really it's a very special part of my life\n\n\n[noise]\nMm\n\n\nMm Mm\n[noise]\nThat's a very special part of my life\n\n\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] oh\nYou can see Patrick an

[laughter] I've been ... ...\n... on up the law and most recently had a baby it happens a lot to so many people every single day\nWell ever since high school people have pronounced either to my advantage as name wrong and when she correct they're put on the Asian that asked where she was from as if it was a foreign aim\nShe'd say I'm a fifth generation south Texan\nAt it as a new one woman play why would I miss pronounce my own name explores her struggle with people's perception of her over time and her identity and multicultural America this is the second generation of her plate tell me your name I spoke with at at about the play in this interview from our guides\nI was very interested in ... why do people have such a reaction if I tell them my name is ... and I refused to say that my name is Irma Herrera\nWhat kind of reactions well look at like what well how do you say it in English well there really is no English translation for my name you know my name is ... name\nYes if you want to pronounce it in English that is how you would say it but that's not how I'm going to say it and I think the first rule of\nMaking friends doing business with anybody is respecting their name and\nSo you grew up in South Texas I did and did you\nI never thought about it because I grew up in complete segregation I grew up in a Mexican American community that was totally segregated so I never really dealt with white people until I went to high school and\nIn high school of course teachers and classmates did not pronounce my named the way I wanted it pronounced\nAnd so you go to the school people call you Irma Herrera ... do you remember what you feel\nI that\nWasn't me you know that type responded to that because that's the name they called in class but that really wasn't me ...\nAnd at that time where you starting to be aware of that and I yeah I was starting\nTo be aware I became aware of the importance of names very early on oh what about six years old I'm with my parents and we visit my favorite on called my deal a deal and his wife\nAnd around noon we hear the pick up the truck that my uncle drives delivering gravel and construction materials and when he comes in house inside the house I notice he's wearing a shirt with the patch and it has\nThe letters T O M I'm just learning to read so I sound it out and when we leave I said to my dad puppy quite a steel shirts say Tom\nBecause that's what they call him at work do people have different names that were\nKnown me he die it's at the ... can't say or deal so they call him Tom\nBut why doesn't deal teach them how to say his name\nSo very early on I saw that my uncle who was a very dignified man was being disrespected at work but he had limited education he was a labor I'm sure he never insisted on his name being pronounced correctly\nBecause what would that mean it would mean a loss of his job in a sense I feel that the privilege I have\nOf having had a wonderful education of being a lawyer of having some\nPower limited in society in a way I feel like I'm the proxy for all those people who don't have\nThe opportunity to say to someone else no that's not my name I prefer that you call me by my correct name and that name is ... Atlanta but I remember one day I was upset because I Would hear newscaster say on NPR\nPronouncing French names so beautifully\nJacques you hawk ...\nBut you get a Spanish name and they'll go Tom parade as well as the last name as bad as it's not ... what is it why what is it it's a status thing ban is just a low status language and people would be embarrassed to speak poor French\n... even though the number of people who speak French in the world is like two percent but it's always been\nAssociated with status and international diplomacy in class so Spanish is a low status language and uh people don't care\n... and one day I remember being yelling at my radio because they were talking about the former secretary of transportation ... but they pronounced his name Frederick Rico\nKenya Mm well she is a pineapple and there's no there's no there's only one are in ... it's not Fred to Rico and so I'm asking where the\nPeople who are doing the news stories you're not pronouncing that name correctly and this person is as deserving of your respect as ... or ... or ... or whoever [noise] um and so what do you want people to leave with after they see your play really [noise]\nI really want people to think about\nAll the ways in which we discriminate\nBecause we all do\nThat's really all I Want is for people to think about what do I do that I should check myself about ...\n[noise] so can you take us out with a bit of performance [noise]\nWell uh sure I'll tell you what my my closing scene is and so a few years ago I was in Copenhagen\nAnd I saw this sign a in front of a store that said eat my I are in a in huge letters and it turns out the largest and oldest grocery store chain in that country is named each month and pronounced like my name [laughter]\nSo in the closing scene in my play I say now when people ask me where I'm from I tell them Denmark [laughter]\nAnd then I tell this story about going to that story and I show 'em a bag that I got that has either my written on it because that's the name of the store with its logo and so I finished shot by saying\nStanding there I began to wonder if people back home thought I was from Denmark would they try harder to save my name\nAnd leave him thinking\n[noise]\nAtlanta's play why would I mispronounce my own name starts today in place through December eighth at the Marshall theater in San Francisco find all the details at K.
