harassment [noise]\nThe measure doesn't say exactly what the panic buttons would look like but in other cities they use them they looked like the alarm on your car keys the kind people used to scare away Berkeley that these devices can alert security without making a noise\nRachel ... is a spokesperson for UNITE HERE oh town hospitality workers union she says issues like low wages and harassment are connected\nBut it's often woman of color who are in a position of being more marginalized than the wealthy gas to come in and the hotels and you also have a training culture in place where the hotel workers are taught to be extremely deferential to these men\nThat effort to change that culture kicked off years before the me too movement\nPanic buttons were first required in hotels in New York City in two thousand Thirteen that was shortly after a hotel maid in the city accused the former head of the international Monetary Fund Dominique Strauss Kahn of attempted rape here's the hotel maid ... the ILO on ABC News\nPlus we elected so they can move\nMore if I had\nNo other cities require panic buttons including Seattle Chicago and Sacramento\nBut a state wide panic button bill in

buttons and then a couple of weeks later or a couple of months later\nOr a local city pass was an ordinance is different than another city over here passes one that's different so there is no predictability at all [noise]\nAnd any time I get depressed about it I just turned to them because they are so skilled in so compassionate and they know exactly what needs to be done\nAnd the idea

coughed up it was built just after the gold rush as a ferry landing for the busy central Pacific Railroad about trucking made both ferries and railroads unnecessary and things slow down in Puerto

teachers and adventurous type to visit the infamous Burlington hotel some people say the hotel used to be a brothel and that has haunted but important hostile it can be hard to find the line between fact\nAnd fantasy this Halloween Eve KLW ... brings us the story\nIt's late on Sunday Morning part is full of people shopping for antiques and getting branch I'm here for a tour of the Burlington hotel\nI Know the hotel has failed to Eighteen eighty three\nThat's Hillary can't men who manages the Burlington\nAnd I don't really know what happened to it between Eighteen eighty three and the early sixties but in that time [noise] I'm a man named bill rich by all the buildings important costs in downtown for something like twenty thousand dollars and he was a Coors Beer truck driver from San Francisco and he sort of the\nNew vote patriarch of the town\nShe dismisses the plaque on the building that says it was once a brothel\nAnd when she leads me up along old staircase to the second floor she bristles when I ask quite each room has a hand painted sign up with a different woman's name on it\nYeah so bill rich I think he was playing off the rumors that it was a brothel and so he named the rooms after women he knew of\nFriends and family and people in the town like there's a room named hazel\nNamed for an antique store owner\nThe sewage his sister I'm\nPeggy and Victoria were women that lived in town and I think all of them are just people that um that he knew from around here\nHillary also just use the rumor that the Burlington is haunted\nI'm here all the time by myself and\nEither I'm extremely unpopular with goes or there just aren't any\nShe says the only spirits she knows about or across the street in the bar called the warehouse\nI think people who [noise]\nWho liked port Costa like who really like it tend to be imaginative\nFanciful people so if you combine that with the fact that the warehouse makes all their cocktails double by default you could come up with some go stories really fast that way\nSo I head over to the bar\nBy now it's afternoon and the street out front is starting to fill up with motorcycles [noise]\nIt's a warm day and there are just a few people inside it sitting at the bar playing pool\nThe bartender and Judy is Barbara Williams\nShe says in the decade she's worked here plenty of customers have told her spooky stories about the hotel\nBut more importantly she tells me that she's seen goes right here in the bar\nFelt the breeze coming across\nI locked the door but I wasn't sure but I turned around\nTo tell the customers that I was close\nRuined that lady here penned up in a bunch of\nShe turned around and she looked at me and she went through the door\nLike she passed right through the closed door\nAnd Barbara says she's seen another ghost in the bar one who is much more well known\nIt was about\nEleven o'clock at night\nI had maybe ten customers but they were all behind playing pool [noise]\nAnd I seen a man walking to the\nI'm like thirty or close the restaurant's closed\nAnd he ignored me\nBarbara was annoyed and went to kick him out\nHe was nowhere to be found\nSo I was\nMaybe I'm tired maybe\nAnd so I talked to\nOne of the other bartenders maybe a couple of days later and she told me she says that sounds like it was bill rich\nBill rich the guy who bought the whole town in the sixties\nDemand Barbara saw was wearing a plaid shirt and cowboy hat\nKnown to be built which is a signature luck\nBut by that night bill which had been dead for seven years\nPort cost a resident aerial Taylor told me about an experience she had at a friend's house just up the street\nAnd it was a really really warm day and there isn't a lot of air conditioning upper Costas you can imagine people on these kind of old houses just open their windows into every window in the house with open to get across sprays\nEveryone was outside hanging out at one point someone noticed that the toddler who lived in the upstairs apartment was getting close to one of the open windows they called up to them other watching\nVery close to the window be careful\nAnd then all of a sudden\nWithout warning every window in the entire house with the top window the bottom windows the entire house the kitchen windows the dining room all the way to the back bedroom every window and the entire house closed simultaneously at the same

disruptive\nPeople have come and look around in the evening when there I guess in the room and they get themselves all freaked out and there's like squealing and hallways and I have to be like you know\nLady screams\nHillary even cancels people's reservations if she finds out there seriously investigating paranormal activity\nShe says she gets at\nThe building is old and parts of it are a little spooky like the peeling wallpaper or they tarnished mirror on the third floor that Hillary wants people to remember that the buildings age also makes it special\nPeople think for the most part that any building of a certain age has to be on it because there's so many people have gone through it that why wouldn't it be and I think that\nI think there's something to the fact that when a place has been around a long time there is a lot of human energy that hasn't been in it like that there is a lot of history that is passed through it and I don't really feel that as something paranormal ghosts the but I Do think it's like ah\nMaybe something that command respect\nJust being older than anyone alive today commands respect\nShe wants people to be realistic about the hotel and its history\nBut that doesn't mean she wants part costs that to lose its edge\nOne of the people who live in town called ... cost of the land of misfit toys and I think it is a little bit like that\nEven
