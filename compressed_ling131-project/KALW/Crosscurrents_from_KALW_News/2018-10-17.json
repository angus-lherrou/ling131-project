D. J. for the Golden State warriors Oakland voice his graduate down mood daily met up with the sharp to go through his memories of the sideshow [noise] ooh\n... grew up in these though I Lived on fifty first jak rum and and the time with a crack era [noise]\nNice though it was popping I'm Talking about it was crazy like I look back at that and I'll be like damn I'm Still alive [laughter] it was like that\nYou know to me here's some vivid memories of that time and they all came pouring out when she was one simple question about growing up in Oakland have you ever seen a side show\nAlways right from my house like I mean all the time so it's like it's like you know you know going out and just being out being so young and then like seeing like\nSeville full of just slapping [noise]\nShe describes a show like that I I feel\nLike when we were coming up believes it as\nIt was cats who were working on a car you know they would they would they would go out and display what they've done to their cars to hype 'em up you know what I mean at at an intersection and people will gather brightly colored old school classic cars will slow down the street shiny freshly painted I remember when I was a\nKid in hopes the sound systems would vibrate the street car trust would be packed with speakers ten and twelve inch Fifteen eventually you could tell who's car was by the stumbling blocks away\nOne corner in particular sticks out in the ... food open the trumpet he got [noise]\nYou know I remember this cat had ten teens\nYet you've you've poppies for opening his ... his hands in the back of and it was\nA children's day I Can't think of another car that I've ever heard slammed that hard it was ten teams tense up over and it was perfect in the back it was like it was it was it was insane [noise]\nWas planned [noise] he was playing a ah [noise] the soul train [noise] so so trying thing\nBall ball ball ball ball ball ball ball that day it was it was pounded so cause [noise]\nAnd everything he played after that was it was all like it really wasn't no wrap everything he was playing with like SOS man and just like\nIt was like stuff that like was like no yeah boots and Collins like a no one's going to love you both ball ball ball ball like just knocked him super hard and that's one of those actually after ... the most vivid I remember [noise] um and I always\nAfter that I wanted to severe [noise]\nHe wanted a four door Cadillac severe and he knew exactly what kind of speakers who get four I wanted a Ford or Seville I was like I could do it for twelve to me\nThat was my thing I was like I if I got four twelve this was mia ten years oh by the way back up or it will be allowed to be not and you know what I mean so\nKnocking slapped been popping bumping banging cracking open NATO's like the shark creatively re purpose words to describe cars and the speaker\nSays terms for beautiful great in Oakland side shoveling and then you have certain cats who come through just flashy and just pull up and just you know like which was\nKnown for that just pulling up slamming hard shutting aside showdown oh man who just show up with just just his presence that that um that orange or what was it the uh the colors\nYou just pull up just just shut it down you know what I mean we're all man he's talking about Richie Rich like a local artist higher classics I show anthem called the sideshow [noise]\nAnd if you listen to how these Sharpe says flashy shut it down you can make you feel like you're right there with them watching the streets begin to peak as local celebrities and pull up in their car and some\nGirls looking real pretty much all man and he was he was like I mean as far as\nI can remember coming at you I mean rich would like to get it in terms of car culture in Oakland though he has some legendary car like real legendary car like you can email you back into it pointed out in the\nRich and India tone Indian tone ask them for their cars to Indian tone is a mythical figure decide showed I competed with people like Richie Rich for the unofficial title sideshow camping now\nIndian ... had a cougars early on a Mustang and share of like he had some veils light on\nLike like the I mean he probably hold the title\nOakland kids of the sharpest arrows debate about the type of thing either way I how I Would I Would do it would just want him and rich I mean\nYou know just through my eyes coming up in the subway and you know what I mean it could be other cats but like\nI mean I've seen like like Indian tone had that as a\nPolice he had a ... you know the war in the ... you know what I mean like the detail that went in to light\nPutting that that cartoon gathering you know what I mean it's like us is like showrooms level [noise]\nThen you probably got it done and you don't really know what I mean\n\nAs for whether sideshow originally began and many still wonder the most qualified answer I could find was from Dwayne wade gifts\nDoes your brother Raphael so deep in the churches of east Oakland during the seventies early eighties he responded online to answer the question of where the sideshow start you said in a Facebook post eighty first and the sport\nIn the quarter pound a parking lot but the answers vary depending on who you're talking to and what air they came up in a lot of people stay where really the into the mainstream popularity was later in the late eighties around ... mall near banned from McDonald's parking lot [noise]\nYou\nReally\nA side show is like a pop up shop or they can open and close on any corner so people will remember them and all kinds of places like foothills where the coliseum or right by the life\nYou can do things in\nWherever it again open sideshow cultures here to stay at least in memory and influence alone\nFor a Martian lunches post game golf carts celebrations cows football field or any later kept shooting the bobble heads off\nTo the Golden State warriors used the phrase the town you know when it's officially NBA Jersey land from the opening scene of the hit marvel movie Black Panther which featured in the Trump to shore it's classic sideshow song\nWhich of an open marriage Jerry Brown two thousand five attempt to jail people\nWithin a hundred feet of a sideshow language it's usually DJ's fashion it's car culture and they're all part of Oakland history of creating innovative ways but unfortunately in this car culture created by people of color\nDoesn't necessarily get the respect that others do in America like NASCAR monster trucks\nFor top down imagine if they do maybe the city could help young people learn a trade start a business with the cars they produce or put on city Central Park competition so and closing dance with the one who brought you support the ones who made the dances and music and my car culture you love so much\nSo I always to the next like in my Pop's Cadillac DeVille me\nWas his dumb daily for cross country but
