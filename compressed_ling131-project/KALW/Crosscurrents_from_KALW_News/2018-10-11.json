of Oakland\nBefore practicing law price grew up in Cincinnati she was in the foster care system and later survived an abusive relationship that moved on to become an attorney and she's one of the few black female attorneys to argue a case before the U.S Supreme Court\nPamela price sat down with KLW Jeanette Darden at her campaign headquarters to talk about her mayoral candidate see\nYou ran for da earlier this year and you live and now you are running for me you why\nBecause Oakland is at a crossroads Oakland is desperate for change and a big part of that change is police accountability and then the issue of homelessness is something that the mayor also has tremendous influence over I've been in Oakland for more than forty years and I've never seen it let's be as bad\nYou have gone up against the police right I have sued police I have represented police\nHow are you going to work with the police that I Would imagine some of them may not be too crazy about you what I think\nWe saw in the district attorney's race where I was attacked by basically\nEvery police union in the state of California including that go for the correction you know a police officers association I I'm clear about how they feel about\nReform but as I said I've represented hundreds of a female officer throughout the state of California so I'll be able to work with them as I work with many people [noise]\nWhat is police reform look like to Hugh in Oakland it looks like holding our police officers accountable when they in fact violate the constitution that has to be fundamental\nIt also means that they respect the citizens of this community the residents between twenty four team in twenty Fifteen hundred and Ninety three whites were\nHandcuffed and two thousand eight hundred and Ninety blacks were handcuffed and that's not arrested those people were just handcuffed there was no basis to arrest them but they found a reason to handcuff them and so we have to stop\nThat kind of street level disparities\nAnd then moving up until the command staff I Want to create a culture within ... D that incentivize as officers to report misconduct so that we can clean out the bad apples and not cover it up by you know and vote using the code of silence that has not served us well\nYou know I understand you're one of the few black female attorneys who have come before the Supreme Court that is true and what is your opinion about 'cause right now there's a lot of talk about the U.S Supreme Court because of a judge Kavanaugh how does an appointment like his affect Oakland\nHis appointment will set this country on a path of um disparate racial disparity\nEconomic disenfranchisement for decades to come in means that the kind of economic and racial inequalities that we see taking root and Oakland that are dry\n... um you know this homelessness crisis\nThat that would become exacerbated unless we have fundamental opposition to it it's going to happen across the country\nI'm a civil rights lawyer most of my work was in federal court and so for me the federal courts were way too to level the playing field and that is not a remedy that's going to be available at least readily available anymore and it was already hard to do\nYou mentioned homelessness earlier what is your plan for helping people who are homeless and and your housing plan as well\nMy plan is the number one we have to provide basic sanitation services and health services to people living on the streets we have to act like we are the red cross when you think about a natural disaster the red cross comes to town they don't\nLeave people on the street [laughter] so we have the ability to get\nPeople off the street whether that's housing providing housing to vacant city property providing housing through vacant church property provided housing through vacant a school district property we have to make sure that we provide support to tenants who are on the verge of\nLosing their um shelter as well as landlords and and homeowners who are on the verge of losing their homes it's not a question of funding it's a question of will\nSo we've seen an influx of wealth into Oakland out and I'd access just about every candidate how do you work with people who right now are struggling your everyday folks and then how do you work with people who have wealth and they're bringing that money into Oakland\n[noise] so it's fine for people who have the wealth to come here and to enjoy our city
