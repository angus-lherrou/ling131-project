week and some Californians are feeling the fence over one particular ballot measure ... tent [noise]\nThe proposal to repeal the state law known as Costa Hawkins which currently restricts rent control with me is KLW economics reporter lines have veal to chat about it so that the stakes are high with this one yeah there's a lot of\nMoney at stake for landlords and then for rent or is on the other hand there's a really powerful tool to prevent displacement so tenants cars to put up a really big fight they've been knocking on doors they've been phone banking\nBut the opposition has raised almost three times as much money almost Seventy million dollars in K. and who is this opposition landlords property investors and even Wall Street I mean rent control puts a price ceiling on their business so they're all in to stop it right now they've got these television ads running round the clock I haven't seen the let me play you some\nWatch out [noise] ... does the opposite isn't what it says ten has no protections for renters veterans are seniors\nAnd then we'll make housing more expensive\nThat's why veterans say you know on and it makes a bad problem or\nWho lived that so so no protection for renters is what does that mean well for the ads don't really have anything to do with the substance of the proposition I mean it turns out they can basically just say whatever scary sounding thing they want ... tennis about expanding protests\nWhatever this proposition is about protecting them okay so what does it do exactly okay so the state law Costa Hawkins it puts a bunch of limitations on rent control it says you can't have rent control on single family buildings it can't apply to buildings that were built after a certain year which is Nineteen Ninety five in most cases\nAnd it says you can't have rent control carry over from one tenant to the next\nSo if that laws repealed cities could try to expand their rent control in various ways so I mean when the ads as prop tennis no protections for renters I mean they're just saying words I don't really have any meaning in this context\nOkay so there are some arguments against expanding rent control to take seriously\nYeah I mean so the common wisdom among a lot of economists is that if the government limits how much landlords can charge by acting rent control there'll be fewer houses built which in turn would cause a shortage and drive prices up at least for buildings that are not under control mhm\nBut just this month a University of Southern California study argued that economists also overlook the benefits of rent control I mean the big one is preventing displacement\nAnd there was a recent UC Berkeley paper which made a similar point it said rent control is a cost effective policy with immediate effects so it's about responding to this crisis not like soon yeah and you know the high cost of housing is eating up so much of people's wages one in five California residences in poverty when you factor in the cost of housing\nThat's a big reason why we have the nation's highest poverty rate and that's a point that is being driven home in some of these pro prop ten ads which sound like this about organized people against organizing money\nIf you're tired of seeing black folks round loaves for folks being pushed out of your neighborhood if you're tired of losing neighbor after neighbor then yes on ten is an inherited monster a monster\nSaliva if prop ... passes bay area cities may or may not change their rent control lives there could be no change\nYeah it'll be up to each city but prop ... allows them to even consider it so for example Berkeley has actually already got a new expanded rent control law that will immediately go into effect if prop ... passes what did they change so the new
