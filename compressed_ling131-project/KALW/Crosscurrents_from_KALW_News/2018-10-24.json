Carmichael elementary on seven and Harrison in the south the market neighborhood\nPhotographer Janet Delaney and I are here to see someone we've been trying to get in touch with for months so Bobby Washington a it was a long term\nResident longtime resident on ninth street she had a lot of stories to tell me about what it was like to grow up in the neighborhood Bobby Washington grew up just two blocks from where we are right now\nLiving there was awesome living in this area was awesome because we were in walking distance of everything that people were ...\nMajority of the people at that time was down and he was mostly African American and Latino [noise]\nShe met Janet ... more than Thirty years ago she knocked on the door and she was asking a lot of questions\nAnd uh I wasn't too\nComfortable with with her at first because I didn't really know who she was in and she asked if she'd come in and I totally yes\nTo lean he came in and took her picture that picture is now part of an exhibit at San Francisco's the young museum it's also on page two of an accompanying photo book called\nSouth of market [noise]\nIn the photo Bobby Washington is sitting in her living room braiding her daughter I on us hair\nThe walls have dark wood paneling and there's an indoor plant hanging from the ceiling and macrame basket the TV's on in the background Washington and her daughter both where yellow shirt which match the pale yellow curtains behind them and the soft yellow glow of the lights and thing in [noise]\n... took this photograph in Nineteen eighty two she was in her late twenties and living in the same neighborhood as Washington on the same street actually south of market was filled with industry\nBlacksmith auto mechanics sign shops it was a working class neighborhood with families a growing gay population an artist\nThat was about to change and Delaney want it to capture it on film\nMy initial site was some construction center rather Moscone Center\nThe Moscone Center is now the largest convention center in San Francisco back in the Nineteen sixties and seventies the land it now sits on was claimed by the San Francisco redevelopment agencies the city bulldozed entire blocks to make way for the giants\nI realized my home and my neighbors were going to be greatly impacted when the site was completed so I decided to try to understand what had been removed in order to build the ... center because I it was you know ten ... square blocks it was seven\nHundred businesses in four thousand people and where were then how did that happen she hit the streets with her view camera the old fashioned kind where you drape a cloth over your head to take a picture she took a tape recorder too and she recorded the stories of some of the people she photographed like Bobby Washington\nGee I when we moved to San Martin when I was eleven that's\nBobby Washington talking ... in Nineteen eighty two after she had her photograph taken\nI've seen all the changes all the disappearing all the comings and all the dough and I would call the last of the litter [laughter]\nTwo years after Delaney photographed and interviewed her a huge fire destroyed her apartment and all her belongings and she couldn't afford another place she moved in with friends and has been struggling to find permanent housing ever since\nBut Washington still has a deep connection to the neighborhood\nLike her job as a counselor at the Carmichael [noise]\nToday she's in the gym hanging up streamers for an end of the year dance\nWe sit down and start flipping through the ...\nYear old I remember my sister and I do some\nWhy blouses off just\nYes these are photographs I mean all over the neighborhood\nMosque this is where I'm\nVirginia moved over

at all these old things\nThere were\nYou know people at odds and people you know in community towards the same thing I was a fascinating it was this great opportunity to get really on an intimate level\nShifting from so much of the mission around the same time as you were photographing south of market in the seventies and early eighties you also started capturing life public life in the mission tell me about\nThat and about eighty one I was looking for a new place to move and I couldn't really afford south the market anymore so I started looking around and I went to the mission I found a great little house and\nI looked around and realize I was in this amazing community that was um\n[noise] really lively compared to South America there were like people on the street the little grocery stores in ... and I\nI got swept up in it I was finishing up photographing south of market so that's where I thought my art was [laughter] but on the weekends when these events would happen I just would be drawn to the crowd and I would just bring my camera to twenty fourth street for\nUh the cinco de Maya or for the independence day parade of the day of the dead and I would show up ah on you know a son on an afternoon I just wandered down mission street and photographed people\nJust leading a daily life I was just\nScooping up pictures that some ways I think I was just making my own family snapshots\nOf my new found a relationship you know that I was falling in love again with a a part of town that had a lot of vibrancy where I was looking for the virus he's half a market which you know it was an industrial part of town didn't have the street life\nSo I was very excited to see people on the streets [noise]\nWhat are you learning now when you're looking back at all the images and and knowing what the mission is like currently and you were kind of photographing at at at maybe at the beginning of of a change\n[noise] it doesn't like on the surface looks super different it's not like south of market that's had this massive high rise construction and and these incredible\nYou know\nDemolition sites um but you can feel how\nThe infrastructure of the city has changed\nOn the\nInternal level like you know what it a little shots like I had a great you know sort of fancy meal on twenty fourth street the other day with like cocktails and I was like kind of okay and then the table next to me there were those five guys that are always together wherever you go the five tech guys right\nYou know [laughter] you know there was [laughter] and I was like okay this is different\nUm you know so the city's change you know and the ownership of businesses will change and evolve and it's interesting the idea of a legacy ah you know in terms of like rent control to help to maintain some consistency with the neighborhood I think one of the main\nProblems has been\nRate at which this change has come it's not an organic uh well you know nothing's organic really it is\nJust to it it's been an onslaught of a you know everybody will agree that that yeah tech\nHas brought an incredible amount of energy and money and capacity and to the city and with that people who didn't keep up or have to get out I mean I don't think that's a good thing because ironically people come to the city for the diversity and for that sense of culture\nAnd I think there is an obligation to try to\nMake sure that that step sticks around because the city without\nDiversity without\nAny I mean so often when I go to a restaurant and this has been true for Twenty years I'll be the oldest person by Twenty years [laughter]\nNow it it just stare out what is laughable you know it just to see somebody is sixty on the street that you know it's really you're still here well no I
