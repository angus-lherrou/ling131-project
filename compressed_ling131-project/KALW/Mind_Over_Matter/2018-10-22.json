before the show and the pain is currently all she could think about so anyone wants to call in with questions who answers our ouch or my freaking toe\nHere I Would consider it a solid it\nI think I tore the nail back like have you know it's weird you know that was the fear that I Know I just don't fall that's not a stone wall to wall to more than the stuff yeah no it's brutal itself very much over you know\nI I'm Laurie Fisher was surprised and a bit disappointed to learn that to day October twenty first is the official day celebrating things he doesn't much think should be celebrated national reptile awareness day and national pumpkin she mistake it cheesecake or is a cheese\nI I don't know what you wrote okay\nWhat are those uh cheesecake makes sense either way I'm with you that's not worthy of celebration I he's still lobbying unsuccessfully for a national mine's ever modern day he'll keep you posted [laughter] I mean that when you're in Orlando next she will not be going to gator land\nIt looks like I won't I certainly will go on October twenty first which is national reptile awareness day and it would be too loud it pay I thought all Florida was date or land um\nMostly is but there's one area where they will actually feed a frozen whole chicken she the gators and really you can only see it out and\nGet every so often I hear the story about the woman walking her dog named set upon an urban legend I suspect is not an urban legend don't happen to like average everywhere\nAnd I'm not anti reptile I don't want a lot of calls it just I don't think there should be a rip to a national reptile awareness day I don't think we need it we're all very aware or moderator Dana Rodrigues hopes that our guess of last week so only the tinsel and not the heartbreak behind the making of our show\nUp at a secret yes [noise] but I dragged my tears will go on um [noise] All right we will begin with your face\nAll right I've got a couple of related
