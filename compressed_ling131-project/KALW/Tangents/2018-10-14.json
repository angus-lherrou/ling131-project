both of you in Bali yes yeah yeah yeah so those were a little bit about what it was like doing body music in Bali\n[noise] man you know what to be honest with you it was never an experience that I thought I Would be a part of\nYou know when you're a kid um and you're thinking about was the do your thing like Paris in Egypt in Rome I never thought I'd be in Bali doing what I Do but we did a show on this in this temple where humans who aren't Hindu have not touches the ground in the thousand years\nThey set up a stage and I am a form and in front of like a thousand year old temple\nWhile you're Hindu now [laughter]\nFor a minute there was like you have to say this is [laughter]\nUm [noise] it was incredible to\nMe it was incredible to share my passion and my guess another part of the world yeah\nI'm into field that to feel the acceptance and to fill the gratitude of it and then for them to show us what they do ... and for me to learn it and then I understand it it was incredible mhm I I I really preach traveling and learning something\nUm it'll make you laugh so much better [noise]\nYeah it was just the experience was was really incredible working with a day well a lot to who he has an affiliation working with Keith here and so he's taken he has a group there\nAni yes sue the money and so he's incorporated body music into the traditional um catch our culture and to see you know someone halfway across the world\nDuring this same thing that we like to do in mixing it with with their culture with their music is kind of what what body music is all about when I was mentioning justice blending of cultures are bringing people together from around the world it's it's mind blowing mind blowing\nSo speaking of blend in cultures and bringing people together from around the world as I mentioned last time I saw the two of you together ... each individual since I was in Guyana and I was there for the second time I'm as part of the educational program called ... freak mhm\nAre run by Dr coffee below neo and some local music educators to your friends and colleagues of mine the good games will be a little busy born gyms hurting\nAnd I was also they're doing a recording project I'm going to play some of that music I'm coming up very shortly but I was lucky to stick around and catch\nJust like the first day and a half of the body music festival\nIncluding drumming with some of the local people as you guys pulled up on the buses you know I just have a video for you by the way oh you have a video that I got to say that um so what was that like ... was it the first time for each of you to to go to ... to Africa yeah yes so tell me about that [laughter]\nOh man I blew my mind to go for it\nUm yeah I mean keep it was like yeah we're something nice cheap wants to do I thought it was like an extra pounds he was gonna say something like you know and I didn't really expect that but what it was was double\nWhat happened was um the chief um we had a great ceremony um a lot of etiquette lot of lot of rural T etiquette\nBut basically what she said was that he acknowledged the um the traps people slave trade mhm and they're the parks that his ancestors had to play and he apologized for that he also said that um we didn't inquire about you guys after you guys left ... and we are sorry about that\nWe know that you've added as soon as from this land but we do not know where exactly you wanted to send us from ...\nBecause of this we want to welcome you back as citizens of this village so you are now citizens of this village for your for the rest of your life\nWill come home come back and visit whenever you can ... and um\nIt was powerful it was you know what it was it was acknowledgement yeah because in America you don't we don't get that feeling [laughter] we do I I mean\nNot to get to political like I'm not totally woken wherever I go [laughter] but um to be in this place that I've never been before too many people I've never been before to to pay for them to look me my eyes say\nWelcome home mhm your home now I'm\nWas was was was making everything legit was like being an adopt a child and finally being making knowledge by the family as this is one of ours\nUm and uh it it was yeah it was powerful and he said to bring back any other members of African Mick commuting back and we'll do the same thing for them mhm is yeah yeah I'm ... now\nI mean it was the highlight of a trip and one of the highlights of my life while I'm at this point I mean to\nThat everything that ... said the the the acknowledgement\nThat welcoming the feeling that yes from that you just have a whole ... you actually have a home now something that most African Americans you don't know where you came from and for someone to offer this to you and me knowing that part of my blood lines\nFor some special ceremony and jewelry that was given to us and you know to just know that hey You're welcome anytime come you have a place to stay you have people that will love you and treat you you know like your family is just awesome feeling mhm incredible\nWe went to the ceremonial place\nWhich was a building that was a from the first settlers of that village that building still stands [laughter] so we started off in the ... the community space\nWhere you meet the chief usually and then we went to the ancestral place ... and ... and finished uh the ceremony there and so we note in front of the chief he gave us be shook our hands and said welcome home um and it's yeah it was\nDope 'em [laughter] it was a lot of different emotions that we've on crying and in in ... and it's just it's it's it's just is rushing over everyone people watching a crying [laughter]\nIt's yeah a home mhm you know having a place to say this is where I'm from ... I'm an every one place to go I'm having a place to\nCheer for having a place to to look after you know is now now got his home now I Want to make sure that my home has everything is needs you know\n[noise] um\nAnd so yeah it was beautiful the word is beautiful you highlight of my life yeah nothing like it will ever cover that [noise] [noise]\nAnd it's just one last time what was it like then bringing an African American art form\nTo Guyana to share what what it is you and your childhood friends and other people that have jumped on the bandwagon along the way your group to to play and teach and work with African artists work with African children and gone on to the airwaves\nYou learn to live in the town I\nMan [laughter] I mean it's one thing to go and play for people that get what you do yeah everyone's happy to see you have a great but at a different thing to go and you are totally\nThey get it they never seen it but they did it they see it and they recognize it and it's that connects you know yeah that's us\nThere is that is that as\nAn African American I don't get too many opportunities and and and my world where I get to see things on TV or on a billboard or even on stage and I go back to me that's attached to me that's us [laughter]\nAnd so to give these people that and for them to know I don't know this guy but I can tell he's a brother he's one of us [laughter] I Love what he does and it's a total connection and\nThey the kids were the kids were inspired mhm they wanted me to stay in one hand he wanted to learn more\nThey The Elders were the war was pride that's what I felt yes touch in is that right yeah I Will try it was it was um\nIt was a like a generational pride that they that I felt from them um and they just they were like when are you coming back what can you stay ... and I'm like I don't get this at home a lot so [laughter]\nYeah I Would watch the audience while while while you guys were performing I was doing a lot of videotape and taking pictures and just seeing the look in the face of Africans and the children mhm the adults and everything like you said like they they got it and they got it and it's they felt pride you could see the pride\nIn them knowing bed no here these African Americans are doing something big that are doing something that's important doing something that has meaning doing something that has a substance to it\nBecause a lot of them don't realize that that Africans for them Africa I'm going for for some of them I'm an American\nSo to see it and they see parts of their culture\nCome back to them it spread their boundaries in their minds of where Africans can go and what Africans can do up\nUntil that happens which is I don't it's it's it's um inspiring people truly inspiring people it's it makes your soul feel good and it's one of those things that\nIt puts you on that path like this is what the world about the world about really sharing my love and it's and it's really pass my passion on this body precaution thing is the thing I Do but to connect with people and to connect with our souls and connect with our hearts in their eyes\nAnd the share this thing that keeps the world moving is what it's about and I totally felt that in Guyana ...\nThank you so much well speaking of sharing your soul and you're in love and connecting with people we've been talking with Angela Davis and Brian dire from the international body music festival which is happening this next coming weekend October Eighteen through the twentieth\nFor more information you can go to the international body music or W.
