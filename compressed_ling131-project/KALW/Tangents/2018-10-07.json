late and most great Jeffrey already and we heard his cover of talking heads listening wind off his albums spirit on the Sony liable\nThen we went to my kids read\nMy kids read was a feature of the\nThe late seventies and eighties in London when I was hanging there and really tuning in especially to the jump he'll show or on BBC jumped pill was like my educator in terms of of being on radio and he he was so influential in Britain\nFor so long um\nIn fact you know I think I read not so long ago that rod Stewart was discovered by jumpy all not one of his finest discoveries I'd say I'd say groups like the fall\nAnd the the ... and of course the undertones if you're looking back into the the new wave in the punk zone that happened\nIt only English side of the Atlantic back then\nJump pill was a huge and basically he had a radio show that came out of the pirate radio seeing went to more mainstream radio on BBC and you know in the seventies sixties seventies era was playing older progressive rock an older music that was rock but once\nOnce the clash and the Sex Pistols heck\nI'm jump he'll just\n... flip to flip\nTo into the the guy who represented the new wave of music that happened in the late seventies which is why I came up that\nWas where I came up if anyone was wondering how did I get to hear from there but I did that's where I came up and I'm jumping who was a huge influence so reggae Mikey dragged ... break down the walls of Babylon and that's where we got to do really have we not\nBecause we surely are in it the the album is called World War three Mikey drudge dot com after that we heard from a U.S based reggae group job as a weapon or we had turbulence from the album vaporized\nAnd then to Jamaica and mystic ... Bowie mystic Bowie\nAnd we heard\nA houses in motion and I was thinking about the upcoming elections in houses in motion but an a and when I put it on I wasn't thinking this is talk another talking heads cover but of course it is itself remaining light houses in motion\nA recently I saw David Byrne I'm sure many of you out there may have seen him in on his recent tour amazing concert\nA really a great concert a great ... great presentation and for once he wasn't doing as a typical talking heads ... show which was I was disappointed that is the last couple of times I saw David Byrne who seemed to be pretty much running down the greatest hits of talking heads and this was much more a\nTheatrical much more or less imaginative and I really really liked the show that David Byrne show so it's interesting to me I'm playing cover versions of talking heads songs of course obviously keep Joe bending\nA detour an entire tour of a an entire show of talking heads covers recently and so mystic Bowie talking dreads is the album and we heard houses in motion\nUm\nAnd that brings me to another story another story tells a story now and again and why don't why I just came back from Jamaica that's where I was\nUh no I've been really off the grid and not plugged into to the um the ... the political shenanigans\nThat have going on here and really not plugged into the the global network a tool and on the last decade the Tigris there with my friend uh we took a drive we decided we weren't going to do a tourist thing in fact we spent our whole time they're off the\nTourist map really um [noise] and instead of doing the thing that that all the tourists guts say you should do in Jamaica we went to visit them it ruins\nAnd the Marines or the proud survivors of a culture and the culture this is an African culture within a Jamaica and was formed in the aftermath of a fifty a war with the British\nOr that began in the late sixteen hundreds and ended I think it was Seventeen Seventy eight\nOff to a whole group of a sizable number\nOf escaped slaves establish themselves in the\nWestern mountains of Jamaica and were unreachable\nFrom the the forces of the British and they have survived the the survivors of of three different African Tribes\nUm and\nThey've made intermingled over the ensuing four hundred years they're a state within the state\nAnd they're known as the maroon because they go to a ruined up there in the mountains and they grew in strengths and to this day they have their own government\nWithin the government of Jamaica I mean within the state of Jamaica the Marines\nHave their own state and their own government and I spent with my friend an extraordinary um a few hours getting to know some of those people that where the ... um rhythms the African rhythms come from in within\nJamaican music mystic Bowie is one of them and he we visited the school up there that he has funded and keeps the tradition alive the tradition of the drumming the tradition of the ... beats\nAnd he uh has with his success in the world which includes working with the Tom tom club and then the connection to talking heads again\nBecause of course Tina Weymouth and of course France of talking heads with Tom tom club\nAnd mystic public place with them his album that featured here is talking dreads and I figured I wanted to play another lesser known talking heads song which I recall his me ... rambling on but I recall when I first saw talking\nHeads of opening a show for the ... mountains talking heads and Ramon is on the road together\nTalking heads open the show it was a small club in Plymouth in ... and\nThat would probably about forty fifty people that may be I had to stand on a chat to be able to see them 'cause the stage is so low and\nThey were they blew me away I went to his every moans and talking heads I came away with talking heads but I Love the remains as well anyway I remember them playing this song\nLove goes to a building on fire and this is ... version from talking dreads mystic ... of the ... of the ruins\nThe talking heads the reminds the Marines in mystic ... are you with me yeah he goes love to go to a building on fire\n\n[noise] that was not meant to happen but it was ending the unmistakable voice of ... there and ... bay from the ... the complete whom he must sue my collection\nSome ... exotic I got there so I guess this was a promo copy 'em a machine that I recall a time when I open to ...\nDressed in wild close a I'm a show to show to the good American musical to back to back night ... probably two thousand don't maybe late nineties\nI'm not even sure if you're still with us one would hope she is what a character won't know what a being a ...\n... we started with mystic bully\nOf the ... people of Jamaica love goes to a building on fire his cover in fact one of his\nAlbum what was it cold talking dreads talking ... yes ... ... [noise]\nUm and that was that was great and then we went to I couldn't resist junior moving police in these from Ireland forty volume five reggae roots\nAnd then I just had to move away from the ... it's very seductive when you get into it and it's not I'm not known for my regular programming or this year or anywhere else and here you are listening to Ninety One point seven K.
