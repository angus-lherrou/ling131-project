album come on in [noise]\nAnd then we went to Willie ... who was a based in Brooklyn until fairly recently but Karen and I had the great pleasure of seeing him busking on the streets of New Orleans\nShortly after he had right relocated from Brooklyn and I hope he gets out here to play because it was just an incredible tree to see I'm I'm a ... with just his guitar he's an amazing guitarist and the very soulful singer\nSo that song was the uh the traditional shake 'em on down and it's from an ... of his called shake come on down\nAnd then we finished that up with a local beyond
