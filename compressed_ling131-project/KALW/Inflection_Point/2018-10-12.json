Washington DC for the E R s they equal rights amendment [noise] at that time only ten percent of our lawmakers\nAre women and twenty Fifteen only twenty percent or what\nTwo percent a year which is less than the rate of inflation\nIt's less than the stock market index five hundred over that same time period at a two percent growth rate which is not even guaranteed it'll take another thirty five or forty years to get to even forty\nPercent and hello Donald Trump just got elected as our president [noise]\nYou know since election day you know emily's list has seen I think over Fifteen thousand women come to us and say they want to run for office that is a historic amount of energy from women looking to run for\nOffice up and down the ballot well at least one\nGood thing came out of his presidency sixteen thousand women I imagine every one of the women who do run for office all get elected and the next cycle is that even possible [noise]\nI often have said that women are the majority of people who show up to about we are the ones who decide elections fifty three percent of the electorate are women so it's in the bag right [noise]\nI Know intuitively that more women in office is a good thing [noise] preferably more pro choice democratic women but not everyone who can vote knows that we need more women even Cape black didn't know\nI didn't live in a time and you know also recognizing my own privilege here I didn't live in a time where I thought that my rights as a woman were under siege necessarily\nUm I also didn't see great strides for women in my lifetime or until I became a little bit more woken a little bit more attuned to to my place in this world and and really then you know started to understand a little bit more about how our rights are under threat almost every single day\n[noise] so now we're at this point we're Democrats could ride the wave and feminism spring more women's voices to government as the chief of staff\nOf emily's list ... can inspire directed money to budding politician and\nFound a call ... action for women to get more involved in what was her next step Z and how was she and other emily's list or confront and defeat a growing backlash\nAgainst feminism from Trump's most fervent supporters and what does that actually take to run for office and when we can't wait another forty years to get the forty percent and anyway why did so many women vote for Trump\nWell it's an important point and I think it\nThat child care is expensive for example as soon as you start to bring in your own story and talk about how you know the very notion of paying over two thousand dollars a month for your child care and how that is more than your mortgage or your rent 'em and how you might have to quit work just to make an economical for yourself\nTo be able to to provide your child child care um it's not until you tell that story that someone might see themselves in it and then they connect with you on a on a much deeper level um and I think it's it's bringing your own human side to an issue\nOr a debate that always moved people um\nI I also will say I have to believe that those stories need to be based on facts which is my job right it's my job as a researcher to make sure that that any story that we're telling is actually accurate because we have to if we're asking our voters are supporters to invest in us we have to trust them and give them the real truth\nThis is inflection point I'm Lauren Schiller my guest is Kate black the chief of staff at emily's list will be back in a moment if you like what you're hearing and

okay overviews made possible by listeners like Linda genes of San Francisco and the thousands of listeners who support KLW year\nThank you for keeping to support your local public radio station can close more to come from flushing point [noise]\n\nI learned Schiller and this is inflection point I'm Talking with Kate black the chief of staff at emily's list an organization that helps pro choice democratic women get elected for office\nWell this is I mean this is really I feel like the crux of the issue for women and politics and and\nPretty much every other industry that we participate in and and and relationships and so on is that we are assigned a certain set of characteristics that we need to\nBrain we get ... for it\nAnd yet when not every not every woman is is the same as the next to him and just like not every man is the same as the next man\nI mean you're you're in the field of promoting women candidates specifically pro choice democratic women candidates but\nHow do you feel about defining women as having certain characteristics like you know we've been touted as being more collaborative and that's better for a working across the aisle or being better listeners you know same result in politics yeah men like what are your thoughts on great point\nAnd it's a great question I think one that that you know\nI'm as we're seeing I think more and more women come together um in twenty Seventeen you know millions of women both Democrats and Republicans I think marched on January twenty first\nI think we're seeing Republican and women um members of Congress come together over um you know saving healthcare reform\nYou know we saw Senator Susan Collins Republican from Maine and Senator Lisa Murkowski and independent from Alaska um vote with the Democrats and all the Democratic women senators to save health care reform so I think we are seeing these moments of um\nGreat unity at the same time I think your point about some of these qualities are characteristics that that people talk about with women especially women leaders um I think there's a fine there's a slippery slope between being a central is\nAnd equating that all women are collaborative or is that all women are better listeners or um that all women\nUm want to work across the aisle I I\nI think we can find ourselves\nIn a space where we forget that all women are not the same or to your point and I think I'm reminded of that whenever someone asked me why does emily's list only support democratic women are we support democratic women because we know that those are the women who are going to stand up for women and families time and time again\nThose democratic women who are more likely\nTo um whether it's on abortion rights or on health care or it's on the environment or criminal justice reform\nUm it is democratic women who are going to be the the champions for women and families I'm In support women and families that have returned um I think\nAn essential his argument negates women's ability to be individuals and to have specificity\nUm and I think when we do that we fall into some some dangerous trap\nYeah and I actually just even\nThe most recent election there\nWas concern I was concerned actually that one of the\nCollateral implications if you will if Hillary Clinton had been elected president was that there would actually be a backlash\nAgainst women and\nAll the games that we have made to date [laughter] and it turns out they were having like this other weird reverse pendulum effect where Trump was elected\nAnd now\nAll these women are coming out seemingly of the woodwork to stand up for\nWomen's rights and\nWould positively affect women and get the people who are\nMost in leadership right now are not necessarily on that side says this is interesting\nI don't know equilibrium ... equilibrium as a result of of the election to something that was completely unexpected I think\nYou're exactly right that we are seeing a feeling like a pendulum shift back the other direction\nBut I think a lotta millennial women are in the same boat as me and it wasn't until you know frankly Hillary\nAs a candidate started talking about it is\nIt's not like those feelings you know between\nOf Donald Trump or or men or women for example I hadn't been out there for a long time but I feel like through the election and through his inauguration and into this year of his first year in the White House I think\nRight we are seeing and a a real nice to\nBoth the Republican Party's longstanding\nRecord of policies that hurt women and undermine our value um but you're also seeing a man in the White House who I don't think respects women are and who is I think actively even from his first week I'm surrounded himself with with men as the undead\nPolicy after policy that um\nWas put in place to help women\nSo you were born in the eighties I've got two daughters who are born in the two thousands their experience there they're [laughter] they're being ... if you will is I'm like I feel like\nThat's all we talk about in my house is what's going on in the political environment because we have the radio on all the time and they're you know they're seeing the headlines in the newspaper which we still getting print at home and it's kind of unavoidable to\nTalk about what's going on in the world so I feel like they're they're probably like there are so well now they're probably gonna want to like go to sleep when they become your [laughter] your tires [laughter]\nUm but but for you you were talking about growing up in the eighties and feeling sort of like it wasn't really something that was top of mind for you until you had this you know sort of awakening and I was wondering if you could just\nHow that came to be for you\nSure [noise] um so politics is not a\nTopic of discussion in my my household voting was a very personal decision in my household I mean I I think I asked my parents went to they voted for and they didn't tell me which I was like\nI didn't quite understand but I knew that meant that it was private\nUm and so then the conversation about politics was private [noise] it wasn't actually until college\nUm when I was home from school\nAnd um\nI was riding in a car with my dad in Columbus ohio and there was a car in front of us have had a bumper sticker for um George Bush\nAnd I remember remarking to my father oh George Bush who would vote for him and my dad kind of just quietly turned to me and said maybe I Would and it wasn't until that moment you know in my twenty first year probably that\nThat I knew my dad might be a Republican\nAnd you know the interesting thing about I think my kind of evolution into a very political life on a very feminist life and I'm very active it's life has been also seeing the evolution of our political dialogue within our family um you know learning that my\nMy dad um uh has supported Republicans in the past and my mom has voted independent has been an interesting\nShe's a conversation you know it comes up with Thanksgiving sometimes when it comes up in other ways to\nFeels when he tried on for the first time\nHe's eventually what you're going to want to do is address starting to tell more and more people\nThinking about running or you want to get their input or advice I'm\nAlso you want to start building out a list of those people keeping a goal of of um supporters and allies um so the eventually when you do run you have a place to start you have names and emails and phone numbers of people that you can call to for support for money for you know just\nHaving a a team at your disposal and ultimately voters that you're back which is really really important and the last thing I Will say is you know if you're thinking about running for office\nJust run [laughter] just run you know we talk a lot about training and there are some really great training programs out there including the one like emily's list like I described but if you're ready to go we never want to make training\nA barrier there are too many barriers and in the face of women who want to run\nAnd so by no means do you have to go out and do every single training um that's out there for women candidates because of the men are not waiting the men are not asking to get trained and so if you're ready to go run and run often\nUm seventies your act the president of emily's list has a fantastic quotes that that accent exactly that that that you will run and you could lose but that last could lead to another opportunity and another campaign so the more that we get women out there running in places where they could be successful or at least get their name out there and a way that matters\nTo people um I think it is a good step towards our goals\n[noise] this is infection points I'm Lauren Schiller my guest is Kate black the chief of staff and emily's list will be back right after a break\nOn again and Eugene Jones and\nYoung this ... this is Michael mush joined me for a fascinating rhythm and blues gospel\nAnd um [noise] um and um and and\n[laughter] [noise]\nHours of French cultural metal more fix beyond category music radio on tangents didn't ask me is that it's a classic progressive reform radio embracing creative jazz hybrid rich Americana and music from all over the world\nThat tension so Ninety One point seven your local public radio Saturdays due to midnight [noise]\nI'm Lawrence Taylor and this is inflection point I'm Talking with Kate black the chiefs of staff at emily's list an organization that helps pro choice democratic women get elected for office\nTo catch this as a podcast and catch up on all the other fascinating women I stick with an inflection point just search for inflection point and I tunes radio public or wherever you get your podcasts\nIt's so interesting it sounds like these could be the same steps anyone would take if they were\nWanting to start their own business or be an entrepreneur of some kind\nOf [laughter] I'm I'm thinking about running for office\nOr building a campaign so to speak is a campaign is a is a small business that you're building\nIt has an end date on election day um but you will raise millions of dollars you will hire staff you will um advocate for a product being you um you know in some ways it does mirror\nA a lot of pieces of a building a small business\nDo you think that the personality type that is suited to doing that\nIs different from the personality type that is suited to now you've been elected and now welcome to the bureaucracy which is a totally different mindset and there's all these other you know a constraints in places that aren't there when you're doing your own thing\nYou know I've seen I've seen women run for office who would\nCall themselves in the river and\nThey are tremendously successful\nUm both on the campaign trail and when they're leading and writing policy I've seen women run who\nAre I have never been afraid to speak in public\nAnd and then once it gets office there they're\nUm I don't think there's a ... a personality for a candidate that works one way or the other to be Frank I think\nI think I've seen women bring their own brand of leadership to a variety of different campaigns and and I've seen them be successful and I think that's a good thing especially for you know a former shy girl like me\nUh it's comforting to know that I can I can watch other women who say that they're introvert and instill you know kick a lot of but up and down the ballot\n[laughter] I mean I realize there are a multitude of positions a person can run for but does does one typically have to leave their day jobs in order to do it\nYou know that's one of the questions we get a lot um and it kind of goes into the barriers which I'm happy to kind of touch on a little bit younger than I Am so\nWe knew we get that question I think that question comes from a couple of different things one is the financial security\nThat often women are responsible for for their family right now women are the solar co breadwinners in over two thirds of American households\nWe're also the majority of minimum wage earners in this country so I say both of those two facts because they think it paints a pretty stark picture\nWhenever you're asking than a woman to run for office with a real understanding that or they just described that's like starting a small business um so do they have to quit their day jobs in order to do that\nYou know the reality is every job every position that you might want to run for might require you to take different amounts of time off right a city council\nMay not require you to take a you know quit your job or go on leave in fact you might be able to negotiate working part time or having flex ours um but running for office let's say for the United States Senate\nWill require a large amount of your time\nI mean that's just you know I don't want to hide the ball there but it's important to understand the time needs of different types of campaigns there are over five hundred thousand officers that you can run for in this country a lot of those people most people don't know right you can run for\nAnd some counties they have something like a special district or the fire\nMarshal is an elected position um you can run for sheriff you could run for um controller you could run for city clerk you could run for I mean I could go on and on the point that I'm making here is that it once you understand the position you want to run for\nThen it's time to have a conversation with your employer I'm with the support of your family and you're probably you know political advisors or team don't understand a little bit about the time that's going to take you know one of the things the other barriers that we've seen that I'm certainly can hold women back\nFrom running is the financial barrier\nBoth in terms of you know not being able to possibly leave a job because they need to run for office or frankly because women get paid less for doing the same work so we have less money um and we also have less access to the financial networks that men have typically had easy access\nTo 'em and so you can undermine the financial\nBarrier that is in front of women and frankly is one of the key reasons at emily's list was was created in the first place was to\nBuild that that early money that initial angel investment that Kickstarter campaign that women candidates need 'em to help them really start to build out a solid political um campaign ... and this will be a great time for me to ask you to explain the name\n... happy to do it [laughter]\nI said I Love it [laughter] emily's list is an acronym it stands for early money is like east\nThat is the the the foundation of emily's list we started in Nineteen eighty five when no\nWoman had ever been elected to the Senate in her own right\nSo in your history of of\nOn behalf of women has there\nBeen a moment where something that you've turned up or understood or been able to get together a narrative that has created a turning point\nFor that person that might not otherwise have happened\nYou know so much of my job is\nPrivate and personal\nI think what I what I Will tell you is\nHave had women candidates\nWho I sat down with and coached and talk to about about their personal stories and one of the questions I always ask is um you know what keeps you up at night\nIs a piece of information that that you are worried about or um uneasy about and once I Know that we can help solve it and\nYou'd be surprised and also not surprised by what comes out in the conversation you know it is sometimes\nSomething small like I've gotten a lot of traffic ticket [laughter] um and and can someone find those answers yes those are probably public [laughter] um\nBut sometimes it's um you know I had a really messy divorce and I'm I'm worried about those records being public or I was late paying my um personal income taxes a couple of years um or it's I've had a family", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Inflection Point", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "12"}
