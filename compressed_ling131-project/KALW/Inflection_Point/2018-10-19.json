twenty minutes south of both Minneapolis and St Paul\nI'm Lawrence Taylor and this is inflection point stories of how women rise up the first thing you need to know about Aaron is that she's the only person to flip the Republicans\nNeed new in the ... election [noise]\nI I have always been a person you a question not\nJust the way things are about why things are the way that they are a lot of times when you ask someone why do we do this this way the answer is often a we'll always done it this way and I'm a person who likes to question why do they do it this way and politics is a great place to get back to the root\nOf why we do things the way that we do [noise]\nI should mention that this is uh\nBecause I've done for this show not a single one has been with a politician as one woman on Twitter set upon hearing about this interview that's so nice I don't remember what it's like to have respect\nFor a politician [noise] well there are a few out there who are doing the job we sent them to do and I'm hoping this conversation will help us all remember what it's like to have respect for a politician\nAs more women run for office than ever before I thought it was time to give credit to women who are already in office and to hear what they're really up again\nHow empowering it is to run for office and what kind of how are you really have when you win\nHand what stands on the way of votes\nWhich brings us back to Aaron may quit specifically and her first run for office\nTruthfully most people were like well she's not going to win and because I was running against an eight year Tea Party conservative she had taken the seat from a Democrat and had won by wide margins for the previous for cycles and so I think people just thought art crazy go ahead and have fun and let's see what you can do [laughter]\nSo right away when I started to run you know people have a lot of advice for you when you start running so I'm biracial my dad as black my mom was white [noise] um I'm gay and clear and I'm young millennial I'm thirty two and to be quite Frank with you I'm\nVery short I'm five two and I tend to have more of a baby face so I don't look thirty two I probably look more like twenty five\nI'm and I'm progressive I've never had not I've always been progressive and so when I started to run people gave me advice like on don't talk about being gay had a professional relationship with your wife in public which I really don't know what that means\nIt's clear the air and had to tear down some expectations about what it would take to win this written\nAnd along the way another thing creep day and I use the word greed deliberately\nWhile she was running for office and after she was elected\nAaron had her own need to moment but we'll get to that later [noise]\nWhen I was I was Fifteen when nine eleven happened and I remember shortly after we're going to war in Iraq I had so many questions for adults because I didn't understand why we're we're going to war with the country over the actions of a group that may or may not be in this country\nAnd I would ask really basic questions and they would always say like you'll understand when you're older or don't ask questions like that instead of answering my question\nAnd it was at that time and I realized asking basic questions shouldn't throw people off they should have a very quick and basic answer for that and so at that time I realized that maybe they're not asking those kinds of questions and someone should be asking those questions and so that's when I started thinking\nUm you know don't be progressive you should moderate yourself and you know I never did any of those things that that was the overwhelming advice of most people\nAnd the difference for me and so this was probably the good part is that this is a community I was born and raised and my parents moved\nTo the community I represent in Nineteen eighty two they had their wedding reception at the local community center they have lived their their whole lives we were raised there so these are people that I Know these are my teacher is these are my pastor is these are my fellow churchgoers these are my friends are my friends' parents\nAnd so when I Would get this bad advice from people who didn't live in my community and be like oh okay sure\nAnd then I Would know in my heart and my gut that that's not what the people of my community once I never wanted to run a race where I was trying to run towards some missile logical middle I'm In order to be elected I wanted to tell the truth about what I believed in and what I think that we should do\nAs a state legislature in terms of policy and where I thought we were at as a community and if people were on board than they would vote for me and if they weren't than they wouldn't but I never wanted to win by pretending to be someone that I'm not to be so\nI really enjoy talking to my community and learning kind of some of the more interesting issues that I hadn't been aware of beforehand\nThat's so interesting so I mean can you tell me more about who they you know there's been handed to somebody they are I mean is it the sort of I don't know for lack of better the establishment you know other people who are already in politics or who who is giving you this advice to kind of cover up who your authentic self really is you know it could\nSo like you know I've worked in politics for very long time so my friends tend to run in political circles so it could be offhand\nRemarks and advice from a friend or from a Senate district chair\nOr from an organization that was thinking of endorsing me or going to endorse me and it was never said as um we don't believe in you know maybe if you do this we will it was we really believe in you and think you will be a great voice of legislature we want you to win\nAnd we just don't know if if those folks in your community will vote for you if you tell the truth about how you feel about X Y and Z\nAnd I proved the opposite I told the truth about every single thing I believed in and I think more than anything what I have found is that people respect the fact that even if they don't agree with me on the issue they know exactly where I stand\nWhich means every time an issue comes up that maybe we didn't get the chance to talk about during the election they trust my judgment and they trust I'm where I'm at on the issue because they know where I Am at that issue and that's um something I always tell folks is that people very rarely vote for you\nBecause of the policy positions\nWhy we kinda see some of these swing districts here in Minnesota\nIt's so interesting and I mean in many ways and and and particularly I'm thinking of ... in this way of\nThis old I'm going to call it old school because I'd like to be old school thinking of how to work within the current system when we know that the current system is broken [laughter] you know sadly against women generally and people of color and\nUm and your bravery really of just saying like this is I'm not working for me and I'm not going to discover of the things that I that I Am and and believe and I'm going to\nTry and change things by being who I Am even if that's not what the system typically elevates\nAnd I think it's it's not working for other people either you know up until being elected I was kind of adjust citizen right and I knew that it wasn't working for me either and so I have this deep\nLove and reverence for our democracy and for our constitution and the way that our government is set up\nBut it is set up based on truth telling and it's based on us really being in\nCommunity with an in conversation with the people that we seek to represent and I think we moved away from that\nTowards you know can talking points and pulled tested language\nAnd uh trying to find again that mythological middle on to appeal to the widest number of folks and I always say that if you if you try to run to the middle and everything you lose everyone on both sides ... and so people actually want to know where their elected representatives stand even if they don't agree with them\nThey want to have access to those representatives to share thoughts concerns ... names\nUm even if it's hard right we have folks here in Minnesota and across the nation that won't hold town halls or they'll have selective town halls where there's tickets and you got to show your ID I have coffee and conversations during session every weekend and out of session every month and then I have town halls quarterly\nAnd they're open to everybody because it's really really important that we do not stop listening to the people that we seek to represent because it's hard like people might yell at you oh well they're yelling at you about something that's a tough in their life or that they need you to hear because\nWe're doing the work for the people and if we don't talk to the people don't we're not doing the work\nWell what in what was your experience and what has your experience been in this age of social media with people who are yelling at you on the Internet trolling really\nYeah I'm so I thought well there's a few things so I'm science has shown that trolls um tend to get discouraged when you respond to everyone else except them and so I use a tried and true method of positive reinforcement there are\nPeople who started on my Facebook page or on Twitter as people who are there to ...\nBut when they would say like oh I'm interested in that I Would respond and be like that's great tell me more and so through positive reinforcement um they're not trolls they're just people who are constituents that comment on things now do I love every comment now\nBut it's gotten to a respectful place where I don't have to hide it and I don't have to ban people from the page and said on Twitter and I do like to interact with people and have thoughtful and intentional dialogue I think that social media is a place where we can have tough conversations about some things not all things and not super nuanced conversations\nBut so you know the trolling\nIt's not particularly bad once you learn how to use the meat function and meet some words and then actually engage with folks that disagree with you in a respectful manner\n[noise] did did you experience any trolling that would be essentially considered hate speech yes I did I mean\nMy opponent and twenty sixteen I'm was endorsed immediately after giving a speech are saying you know just starting my marriage and my ethnicity um and you know I was called a dyke um I was you know I've had some racist terms lobbed at me\nFor being biracial and not particularly dark but yeah that does happen and I think more than anything I feel pity for those folks to carry that amount of rage and anger and that very limited worldview around more than anything else and so I Try to approach it from aspect of\nCompassion more so than being angry or like taking it very personally as if it's some sort of relevant attack on my character did did you have to work to get to that place you know honestly working for um President Obama and then working for Congressman Keith Ellison yeah you see the worst things\nUm and so you you get to that place when you see enough\nTimes really terrible things you know I I'm colleagues Ilhan Omar or we were elected in the same term and so seeing that the type of abuse and hate lobbed at her um is ... like what is a lot and he is nothing compared to that and so getting to that place I think a little bit of is it just being thirty two years old and being like that's not going to be a thing that shake my whole day\nUm but yeah it took a little bit of time to not be super\nOr hurts and offended or scared honestly 'cause again being a anti gun violence a person you know you\nKind of get some of them are scary dangerous um folks and the other side of that that issue is also scared I think is probably the biggest one that had to work to get in a good place for me\nThat's ... that's exactly what I was thinking about is and yeah I had a had a temper that fear with you know being safe on at the same time yeah\nIt's ... I Try I trust people I have a\nDeep and anti biting belief in humanity that's where that theology comes in\nAnd [noise]\nUm\n\nI'm Lauren Shiller indices inflection point my guest in Minnesota state representative Erin make weight [noise]\nAnd even if you haven't been following Minnesota politics the name\nIlhan Omar bring about she rose from living in a refugee camp for four years after fleeing Somalia to becoming the first Somali American to win a seat in the Minnesota house [noise] for those of us playing along on the ... there's a lot of rising up happening is fly overseas and and we should be paying attention [noise] unfortunately\nRising up stories universally involves someone to rise up again\nEnded Erin's case that someone came in the form and the fellow elected official [noise]\nMake that to someone in\nThere and once you got to office\nWasn't anything like you expected it would be\nNo not at all I don't think anyone can prepare you for elected office um a lot of it is like college a particularly at the first few weeks you know you have committee Monday Wednesday friday from eight Fifteen to ten Fifteen you know you have your office here you have meetings you have to write\nUm brief or read brief or write emails back and take meetings I you're learning a lot in a short amount of time you're switching topics really fast um I think when I started to run\nOne thing I didn't fully grasp was that people\nCome to me or look to social media or look to what I'm doing in the lens of you are a state representative or you're going to be a state representative\nText messages to which was helpful in kind of quote unquote proving that this was going on\n[noise] so in the end Cornish and shown both resigned right I mean is that is that the only I forgive forgive my everyday on how this works but can they be fired or do they have to resign so\nA numbers can be expelled by the legislature but it takes an insanely high threshold and that's certainly wouldn't happen I don't I mean it might have in the Senate to be perfectly honest with you but it certainly wasn't going to happen in the house the reason representative Cornish resigned as it was part of his settlement\nWith the um assaults lawsuit with the lobby is that he assaulted\nGot it and then showing resigned and what what gotten him to resign\nUm I Want to give credit to both the chair of our party and the majority and minority leader in the Senate for both calling for him to resign I was very nervous that when I spoke out\nUm they would not say anything or you know maybe defend him and they were very quick with saying this is not OK and he should resign even though we you know we had a\nA one state minority in the state Senate and so that opened up a special election which could have put us further into the minority and um they were very quick and saying this is not OK and he should resign which I appreciate so I think that had a big and he's also a police officer and so I think\nNot dragging it out um and being able to keep the job he had outside of the legislature was important to him as well\n... what was the seat eventually filled by another Democrat yes a woman oh right she's great yeah senator big I'm OK welcome senator big um so as a result of your um coming forward about the harassment with these two guys what else changed\nFor better or worse as as a result of coming forward for you\nI was blacklisted by the speaker gave instructions to his caucus to not talk to me don't laugh with me don't go to her office she's not your friend [noise] um and so it was\nI mean next to impossible to get 'em Republicans to co signed on to bills with me um I had a lot of especially female colleagues that were Republicans that will come to me um to be their number two on bills that they knew I was interested in not stopped um\nKnow settled digs are like little comments here or there uh we had to go through a mandatory sexual harassment training on our second day back the following session after um I have come forward\nAnd that training itself was pretty awful it kind of blame to those who didn't say stop and stopped doing that as the ones who are perpetuating sexual harassment it's really on the\nThe victims to to say stop and if they don't kind of their fault 'em and so it was really hard to sit in a room with and it was mandatory that we were there so sitting with all one hundred and thirty four of your colleagues and they know why they're there are and to have that be the training was was pretty hard\nUm but on the flip side of that you know there were women who felt more comfortable sharing their stories about what happened at the legislature um we started looking at a process for reporting for sexual harassment so for independent contractors the media\nLobbyists because they don't have an avenue to report sexual harassment and looking at what consequences actually look like that started so you know it was a little bit of plus minus they're more minus and plus but it was worth coming forward\n[noise] yeah I I I read something about that training and there was another representative who I'm going to read what she said about it um it was that there was a slide in their presentation that said the most horrifying thing would be to be accused of being a harasser\nMhm and then her response it was\nActually the most horrifying thing is to be assaulted\nAt the site of ... actually said like luck careers ruined lives destroyed and families in tatters or something like that [laughter] as overly not them as a result of arresting people exactly yeah\nUh it was a is and it was given by someone who is actually I'm a defense attorney for people who have been accused of sexual harassment in the workplace so maybe that's where that came\nOut I was your perspective right there that's [laughter]\nThat's yeah different lens to put on things [laughter] yeah um it seems like the training thing is something that is just\nNot really considered all that effective and you get these these [laughter] like screwed up perspectives around who's to blame for the behavior of the harasser what'd you what do you think are the things that are the most effective in terms of putting an end\nTo sexual harassment in the workplace\nSo my one line of advice for every one is do not approach non sexual relationships and a sexual manner it's a very easy thing to do most of us do it every single day [noise]\nUm but I think you know real consequences for sexual harassment and um that kind of behavior in the workplace that is probably one of the best deterrence of it because so often when that happens it's just a joke and you take it too seriously and lighten up than there is no consequences for that behavior so setting cultures and tones where\nThat behavior is not accepted that is the um outlier and that person who was behaving that way is the one who is\nNot sitting in and set of the other way around\nThose are the types of things and I think more than anything um you know every industry has different every workplaces different but if someone who runs a workplace where manages the workplace is really keen on getting to the root cause like take the temperature of the folks that work for you\nBecause they were probably the best equipped to tell you what are the problems and how can we best address them and it goes back to this\nUm idea that if you talk to the people who are most impacted and then listen\nOr you're more likely to have effective results that is true for policy and it's certainly true for a sexual harassment\n[noise] okay so you think things did change again for you though you you were asked to run for lieutenant governor mhm in in the towards the end of your\nTerm right so Aaron Murphy and you\nTo women [laughter] women to Aaron Aaron's to women I mean\nOh wow okay so what I mean I'm I'm curious about a couple of things um ... when I Am curious what role did the\nThe coming forward about the sexual harassment play in her decision to choose you\nYou know I think more than that um I did a sit in on the house floor for twenty four hours um because we have not moved gun violence prevention measures to our house\nUm or through the legislature at all despite you know students rallying and walking out of their classrooms and the number of organized events that had happened certainly before Parkland but absolutely after Parkland\nAnd I was frustrated and I know that everyone who was outside of the capital was frustrated as well and so I did that sit in and\nUm it was it was hard on you know physically as to sit down and be awake for twenty four hours hard but certainly it was in our caucus that wasn't widely loved and celebrated not everyone was very excited that I was doing it\nAnd I think that was a saying that she looked at to say you know you did the right thing even though it was hard even though you've got pushback from your colleagues even though I'm\nYou know it was the right thing to do even though it wasn't the easy thing to do um the sexual harassment peace I think\nWas more that I was willing to do the right thing even want it dealt with people in our own party and even at when that dealt with people who had more power in our own party and so when you're looking at governing state um and lieutenant governor his state or having someone who stepped in for you she wanted someone who could\nContinue the agenda that we had laid for us for Minnesotans if something had happened to her she didn't want someone to balance her out she wanted someone that would continue are very ambitious agenda and she saw me as that person so that was part of the the calculus or with someone who is bold brave and unapologetic about what we believe in and why we believe it\nAnd was it unusual to have a two women ticket for a governor and lieutenant governor have you seen this before we were\nYou were the first all female ticket um endorsed by a major party in the state of Minnesota in a in history\nMhm I'm not common not common how did that play out in terms of your campaign to do you did you play that up did you play that down where where what what was it function\nIf any its function well I mean we didn't\nNot played chew it it was important it was a historic ticket for a number of reasons um it works against us in number of ways because in the same way you know we've seen with female politicians\nYou know for time an eternity the question of quote unquote electability always comes in and it was only brought in in terms of us um you know we are both from what we call the metro so in Minnesota we have eighty seven counties we have seven counties that are\nUm that hold about fifty five sixty percent of the population and then the other eighty have the rest and so they call that the metro and so it was a metro centric ticket it wasn't balanced geographically um and so it was about are they elected will will voters vote for two women or two women from the metro\nUm and it was kind of used as this whole can people really get over this thing [noise] um and so we on our campaign talked about the politics of joy right 'cause there's fear built into that narrative of can't a woman when we've never had a female governor in Minnesota our constitution still says\nHe shall he will he appoints when it talks about the governor of Minnesota um and so I think that that fear can play a huge role um when it comes to female politicians and can they really and will people really\nAnd when we talk about electability right the thing that makes him unelectable is that people elect them that's at our president proves that\nUm but it did play a role in both\nWhy we were excited to run and then also why people might have had hesitant about voting for us", "show_name": "Inflection Point", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
