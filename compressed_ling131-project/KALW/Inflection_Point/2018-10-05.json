World Service news\n\nWhen you think about diversity you think about how benefit people of color or marginalized people but you don't always think about how it will also benefit the majority organizational psychologist Dr Barbara Adams as there is transformational power for\nEveryone and diversity and increased if any [noise]\nWell in business we're all in competitive environments and the business case um gosh McKinsey and company has produced a few of them Credit Suisse has produced one catalyst\nHas produced them there's a number of them they're growing and they are without question strong and powerful than when you look at the numbers\nDiverse groups diversity seems different companies don't perform they out innovate day or more productive um many are more profitable than homogeneous ones\nAnd she would know Dr Adams has been helping companies\nI'm Lawrence Taylor and this is inflection point [noise]\nSpent a lot of my career and advertising and occupation let's just be honest that is dominated by white people when I hear ... talked about these workplaces who have shifted their culture or filter to be diverse in the beginning [noise] I have to wonder how\nMany untold perspective I've missed out on and when I was hiring how many people that I leave out of the considerations that because they just simply weren't on my immediate radar or in my social or career circle\nFor the recruiter I worked with told me that non white people just weren't raising their hands for a job in advertising [noise] it was the system we worked in [noise]\nAnd all of us are just trying to work the system to get ahead and bring our people along with\nWe're simply\nBiologically hard wired to prefer the company of people who are like us\nOr you know goes back to evolution evolutionary times were very tribal people\nSo white people do tend to congregate with white people and black people do tend to congregate with black people and so on and so forth um and women's groups or sometimes you know more fun when the guys aren't there [noise] I don't think there's anything bad about that we just need to recognize that that's how we're wired\nBecause once we realize this then we can begin to do the work to say OK so knowing the power of diversity and inclusion and knowing frankly how limited as to not have that\nHow can I developed curiosity about people who aren't like me\n[noise] so now that we know better\nAnd there is an entire field dedicated to increasing diversity and inclusion\nAnd we'll start to see change rate\nThe challenge and we're companies have gotten stuck and why people talk sometimes we'll diversity fatigue even heard this week gender fatigue oh we just talk about it so much and we're tired of this and just hire them because they haven't made that shift between here's the business case but would it take to actually achieve that\nGoes so far beyond these initiatives that sometimes in death by initiative because it's really about [noise] knowledge that nothing changes until beliefs in mind that change that's a really hard work\nAnd who wants to die by initiative [noise]\nThat brings me back to the theme of this season what is the point of all this empowerment if it doesn't truly lead to power\nWhy talk about diversity when reality just comes back and slapped him in the face [noise]\nAll of that is based on this Mitt the meritocracy that you know it it's going to go to the hardest worker and they're the people who are going to the to the smartest people blah blah blah but\nSince then there's a guy named Tom was headed crew at um one of the UCs um who studied it much more recently I'm up to the year two thousand\nAnd um he found that even if those conditions aren't met just by virtue of spending time with someone who's different from me give me a greater appreciation helps me to grow my curiosity about others so\nMuch just intuitively makes sense does it just it is it is somehow like\nAll the forces of our society\nSeems to be working against that [laughter] that like neighborhoods shift in color you know when one direction or the other so so you might might move into a diverse neighborhood but\nTen years later the whole the\nWhole thing has changed right that suddenly you're with people who ... you looked just like yeah\nYeah and what they found is that your ah the stereotypes you hold about different groups might not shift but the likeability factor still increases\nSay that one more time that the stereotypes you hold the boats certain groups may not shift but the likeability of them still improve\nSo you made a list in your book of people who are never questioned and those who are questioned regularly\nSo issues affecting diversity and equity and inclusion so racism accepted without question white people question with regularity non whites and people of color\nAnother issue sexism except it without question men question with regularity women and people who are gender neutral as well or gender fluid\nHomophobia except without question heterosexual people question with regularity lesbian gay bisexual transgender intersect\nOr religious oppression are accepted without question Protestants\nWhich with regularity Muslim Sikhs Jewish Catholic\nClasses um except it without question upper and middle class question with regularity lower and poor working class people\nElitist them a except without question college educated people question with regularity non college educated ah militarism are accepted without question will be called the good wars World War one world war two the Korean War question with regularity Vietnam the Gulf wars [noise]\nUm linguistic oppression ...\nSpeaker's question with regularity there really one of us\nThink you're going through that less because I I just feel like it highlights all the opportunities that we have to learn more about people that are not like us so\nThere's something interesting but I came across also in your book which is you said that being equal isn't the goal to strive for that valuing difference is mikel mhm and I\nThat kind of made me raise my eyebrows because I in my mind being equal is totally the goal so please explain what you mean an end in women for example are different we're never going to be equal\nExactly the same rate ... men are never going to be able to a birth children and breast feed and do all these great things that women can do so you know women are unlikely to be able to do develop the same level of physical strength on the whole as men have\nSo we are different and women are fuels more by estrogen men more by testosterone that's okay\nIt's really we get into trouble when we act like well you know we have to defer to the guys because they're the ones who run the organizations longest they know the most\nI don't know I don't know if we could say yeah but you know what he was a lot of things that don't work well in organizations and maybe if we had the female point of view more often\nMaybe if we maybe we could say you know we need to shift our mindset we're seeing this too much the same way you know we're the Fort white guys from Twitter or whatever then you know that's where it's the appreciation of difference and I think that that's where the value really lies and we can get past this\nYou know we're all trying to be same because we want to be the same it's those differences that really um make us also dynamic and so interesting\nAnd give us the opportunity to learn from one another and the challenge to within business environment I think we learned a few decades ago that you don't want to be surrounded by the yes men I think that doesn't really get you anywhere you really want people who are going to challenge\nAnd so people were different from you the once more likely to challenge you because they have different experiences and they've grown up in different environments and they've experienced life differently so it's those differences that really really matter I don't want to try to make them\nLike me I Want to figure out what else can I learn from them\n[noise] so like language it's so a more fast but this idea of being equal to you is the equivalent of being the same but\nWhere does this notion of the quality that we are striving for ... where does that fit into this came out I mean would you consider being equal a different thing from equality\nI think of it more in terms of achieving parity\n[noise] so you know if if a woman and a man do the same work then yes they should have equal pay so it's cheating parity I think that um we tend to give opportunities to certain people because we have gender bias sees about it so\nThey're still former women who become nurses and become teachers because we think of them that way you know they're soft skills and they are nice and that kind of stuff\nBut it really kind of who's us to think about it differently because that's where the opportunities come in\nAnd I've known many male nurses and they do a great job as well so parity should they be compensated equally absolutely the benefits equal absolutely you know are they exactly the same in their approach probably not\nBut that's okay [noise] so it's going back to what you're ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... excuses excuses excuses if you look at the data they are everywhere but again it's the shift from well\nWhat do you mean they're not there so this comes up in healthcare comes up in um academia as well\nAnd it helps companies to to look at where we hiring from oh so that's why we're so limited because we just want the cheer one schools you know we want the people who want we want the five black candidates who went to Harvard\nWell you know there are a phenomenal candidates who went to Morehouse and he'd look there and there are lots of an ... in the book I said a couple of examples I mean I don't think a lot of people do that you know a Tim Cook was a graduate of Auburn University\nLaw school but no it's not a phenomenal school um he seems to have succeeded pretty darn well there are many examples like that so it's a mindset shift\nWhere we have to say you know great talent exist in lots of places we aren't yet trained in school for how to look for it there but we could do that we could try different things\nYeah this pipeline theory is very ... [laughter] they're just not there there are a lot I guess my point being there's there are a lot of organizations I'm working to fill the pipeline so the\nUnbelievable rise in girls only stem camps engineering training and ... and\nYou know science exploration of just like so much focus and and you know there's girls who code there's and there's cutting for a you know people have color there's like there's all these focuses on on different groups of people who would typically be marginalized especially in technology um\nAre you and it's been going on for years now so are you aware of any impact that that has had in making a difference\nSadly know why because the mindset is in there and because the hidden bias he still exist at when folks come in\nYou know we say we're fair we're open and all that but if I have a hidden biases that associates\nMen with technology and I really got some work to do to get past that and you know if I Want to go with the guy who makes me more comfortable and you know I can shoot the breeze with and have a beer and all that\nThen no one's telling me not to think companies need to make them more intentional focus\nBut you can't just mandate numbers that doesn't work it still comes back to\nDo I have an environment in the workforce that really helps people to feel like they belong like ... you know I Would say you need to let people know we want you here what's it going to take to get you hear\nNo you are really valuable to us and we want to help you succeed and here are the things we can do to to help new folks coming in to to really succeed here\nYou know here's a person you can go to if they're issues you know those kinds of things it's really um it's a multi faceted challenge but it can be done but I was thrilled to a year or so ago I went to um but ... twenty twenty conference\nAnd um the c._e._o. of Intel's stood up on the stage in front of hundreds of people and said I'm here to say there is no pipeline problem\nI have learned that I understand that and I don't want to hear it from any of you [noise]\nAnd it was like wow so I thought great you know we're starting to have an impact\nBut not everyone thinks this way yet and as a result it's going to be a really slow slog\nSo that when you at this ... yes but they're not going to be OK already more women than men who are going to medical school there are more women than men who are attending law school\nUm and competitions going to try this because these diverse firms are going to perform the others I mean I Know a lot of people think oh you know Google my God you know who they are just so successful to sue amazing they do this they do that well the truth is\nThey make Ninety five percent of their revenue by ads generating ad so as ad blockers become better as there are ... there was a growing number of search engines that protect your privacy people are migrating to those more often\nAnd you know quantum computing is coming up you know Google could be irrelevant tomorrow\nYou know we if we look back and we say oh we used to have standard oil right we used to have these big behemoth companies well how many of them still here but the truth is that it's less than four percent of organizations who lived to be a hundred I says calling people write most companies don't make it that long it's very rare\nSo that you know disruptions will come from places where we can't even imagine it right now but we know that diverse teams out perform others they know that too that's why they worry about it because they you know right now they don't have a culture that's welcoming enough to really shift that\nSo you know I I'm I'm reticent to to um to say just because you make a lot of money you\nKnow that's one measure of success there are many others\nBut when one of the other objections that I have heard\nAround hiring women is that they need to go and you know perpetuate the human race though they're more likely to take time off and we're going to have your family leave and there\nYou know there's more biological issues associated with you know being a woman ... so um what are what are some of the solved to get past that because that I mean I obviously that's ridiculous [laughter] um and it's not just women raising children it's just that we happen to be the ones that have to bear them so last night at the heritage\nRight um main could also have parental leave just a women take maternity leave but I also then comes back to that whole mindset shift where we say we need you we want you what can we do to support you [noise]\nSo a lot of companies say ... especially a lot of the tech firms in Francisco ... you know free food right you know ... free dry cleaning onsite medical care you know it's like we never want you to leave\nBut is that healthy work environment no study upon study upon studies as it is not it's an American cultural no false belief but it's really not accurate\nSo if instead of um you know all the free food and the cafeterias we said we're going to allocate you know whatever some percentage of that too on site childcare\nBecause we think that will really be helpful oh and then whether it's mom or dad they can go visit their kid was right there and we can afford to find these kinds of services so there are\nNo small incremental things that can have a huge affect positively for people's lives but there needs to be the political will to do it\nOn and what about within Oregon organizations there are women's leadership groups and groups that are specifically for women I Would assume to the exclusion of men ...\nDo you encourage those I mean what about like all these lean in circles and things of that nature I\nGo I used to belong to one of those groups um when I worked at Kaiser Permanente um they didn't intentionally exclude men the guys could come they generally didn't and it was really about helping 'em folks who or at the you know mid to lower", "year": "2018",
