Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nSexual assault even under the lowest standard approve she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even worse than that Dr Florida that invites other witnesses to the events so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to corroborate there\nFor the reasons discuss the law I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor couldn't bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standards and the whole\nHave surly investigative judge Kavanaugh's background\nIn addition to the prior six FBI fall feel\nFeel background investigations were the interviews of nearly ... ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir senators extreme view this case Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately uh not quite said what does the U.S because actually correct so for for example said he's sticking to his you that the one person one vote decision was wrong\nCavanaugh a would not\nReally expresses use on almost anything he he would always say that's Supreme Court precedent um I I as a judge had to follow the Supreme Court precedent or things like that so they're really they're not hurting\nLet me stop you there because Charles Grassley was finished his speech on now Dianne Feinstein be equivalent Democrat on the news you're committed to be done her remarks versus the some of them\nWere over Ninety percent of his record has been hidden from the public and the Senate\nNever before have we had a nominee displays such flagrant partisanship and open hostility at a hearing and never before have we had a nominee facing allegations of sexual assault\nAnd the BBC real story of single hour on a single topic it's about Norway and climate change today too on Ninety One point seven KLW\nMiss an fragile coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nKey votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that\nMind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay fine\nI'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact\nSo we're now going to hear a in there and entirety over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from\nIs the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it as Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended\nTo guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their side but don't be fooled by their\nBoring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assault sexual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a a Supreme Court you cannot\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime\nRight they have been found and what what they're saying hits it one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days as well we'll talk about that a little bit more moment apparently Charles Schumer\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom a list of names pre approved\nBy hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public discarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd forwarding norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn twenty Eighteen\nThe Republican majority conducted the hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison in this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely circumstance cry by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago where one week ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say and don't\nWhen it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats from moving forward when it comes to complaining about delaying\nTwo words you never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nGarland Republicans are also saying we engage them quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction\nWith his nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience there and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they choosing Dr forwarded the smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is too they're actually blaming\nThey're crying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats I don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus\nIt can look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate conduct here\nLet them look back on this chapter has this shameful combination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing\nTo win trench in advantage on our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the ignore many us and\nA bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nFor whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh certainly a product of an elite education\nBut also someone with hard right\nConservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans believe why most Democrats opposed his nomination at the outset\nFeels like ancient history now but let us not forget that most importantly\nWe will not only do deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified judge show our highest court not anymore out after all this\nUnited States Senate will also be making a shape whether the states\nPolitics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nUntil proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate ...\nAlmost signed up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy on Americans live\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so low\n\nSo madam president today is a pivotal day and the nomination process of this\nExcellent judge but\nIt's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long or on full display\nSo let's set back in ... through the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate would pave the way to turn it\nCrowds of Orlando protesters\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against him\nMore recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nI'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nWere drinking references oh no\nOur colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh's classmates items right\nSo stop and consider the snap shots\nThe absurdity the absurdity the indignity\nIs our approach to confront\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation mere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nAnd so called resistance until the final vote\nWas called for a few weeks\nThere are France played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat there were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside about Jeffers\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice never doubt\nAwesome what went on\nHospitals vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThe old players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus opinions\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character\nNothing like the character\nSo it was clear mind president the old taxes weren't working\nWhat I'm going to get the job done the resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next\nUncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen\nInto political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr forward and coughing and two of the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow\nMysteriously found its way\nInto the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for truth they're committed collected test and all they organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seven\nInvestigations by an embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence not not was producers support any\nOf the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they had been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yet again I Believe\nThe latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told\nSecondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nThe latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third I Am\nAbout nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses never mind that they didn't actually witnessed anything they didn't want to say anything\n\nWell let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say they'll say first heard thirty five years after the suppose\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're ... very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing and knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things Senate do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central a two one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to a confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree you would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime really of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary and let's just listen to a little bit more as they go through the roll your kill him\nMr Toomey Mr Udall Mr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia has a no vote Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK\nSo Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so how do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sense about the final vote goes until they band together\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or have assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for clay\nThe telegraph really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has gotten into Delaware in ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this cat\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin and you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and they have been a and the ruins it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at the report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes too\nA huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench you would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering the relative to Democrats at according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats are already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is the correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over until it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabin all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring in another voice here as we await the final tally they're not quite a final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient Alex Conan\nHas been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate\nMarco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program ... could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base\nThat frankly you know I think it was looking for something\nTo get on to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm they're gonna do jazz and gap has a lot of the service has shown as NPR's survey showed earlier this week that really arrows in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence\nElection and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters are ... and that was a challenge for us going into the metro it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're on the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up and the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and\nWe've seen the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking\nConservativism Republicans as a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of the nail on the coffin in terms of locking down for\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee\nFrom a Republican perspective we wanted we wanted to have a a a another twenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session so I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely\nWhile their character assassination continues and then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor which is\nThere's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee another solid a judge on the Supreme Court that is a great deliverable for for our base just like tax reform as a good deliverable for our base I think we're if you're a Republican voter who has mixed feelings about Trump's personality as frankly I Do\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate and the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that talks fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as long as well as anyone and she goes in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well\nGood morning to you both in mourning mourning how you've thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice\nPresuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court that it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance sport sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and they may\nMove on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nIt's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would be dumb\nWe're not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this time so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that\nI ... I appreciate that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is\nRepublicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block a action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes\nOne of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnother one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to a to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor\nIs that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride run open\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it's it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and when I met on why would she do that\nWell the the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't\nAnd at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be she did not say that and and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option\nShe may I don't think she's actually well who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's under like she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules\nWere different when that sort of thing would happen you'd get sixty votes for cloture then maybe only fifty two votes to pass\nSome if you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine\nToday her decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who is never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the facts free verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate will have the final so\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer to date with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here in special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now more lately is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly mail\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news of the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about uh that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the uh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know\nShe might be actually trying to uh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know he deserves a vote I'm going to vote no but he deserves to vote that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe mansion who\nI think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a an his vote today a to a vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now [noise]\nAh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing\nAnd then there's the reality of politics we're deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one or plausibly although it's a long shot in both houses of Congress could flip\nAnd we have mentioned in our live coverage here that there are about ten Democratic senators who were seen as vulnerable representing states that voted for President Trump and now up for reelection\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where\nWe had been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate the vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court is not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today\nPerhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nThat the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word in terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is devoted let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you're here to medical well\nI think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years than somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate and the the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now a lot of Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obvious\nAs many people as a you know some of the other states so she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought\nCould be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion or because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe Manchin when\nWe say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody representing the state well I mean that's one that I'm not a fix would suggest that not as a Democrat that pro democratic thing I mean that somebody who would ... going on their vote right go against their base so\nWhen you think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with\nThe pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor but protesters\nOutside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday I must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n[noise]\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the\nExcruciating conflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories\nSo we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't that a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips\nMerrick Garland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we're not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell said Mitch McConnell said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the justice\nAnd people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and and and Obama had thought he was doing a I'm\nA a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is ... that you pick a lottery he picked a moderate liberal uh Vick and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick\nGarland no longer really young in his mid sixties who had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the oh a whole month and that\nThat you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nA Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listened to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also are on NPR News frequently cover the middle east\nAnd every debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick up your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen Iran\nAnswers that I've just a lot of ways in which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and ... and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what are beginning point you want to want to set for when the story started to go wrong\nYes there are some similarities here and for Republicans the years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time they had just one of the year before\nThey had one that's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning in the south with black voters they were winning with African American votes and Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case\nThat those southern Democrats really owed those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who was willing to quite freely admit he had highly conservative views remarkably eye opening eye popping views on some of the oldest\nSupreme Court precedents and the Democrats were appalled in the hearings he was somewhat combative himself in the hearings not to not like Brett Kavanaugh was last Thursday but he was certainly pushing back on all of the assertions that were made about him\nAnd so when it finally came to vote in committee he lost in committee Democrats voted against him and when when it went to the floor they were even some Republicans from southern states voted against him because of some of the extreme positions he had taken Republicans have never forgotten Nineteen eighty\nTo serve in the state legislature Thursday October eleventh that seven PM information at J. C. C. S. F.\nDot org forward slash arts special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United states senators voted fifty one forty nine to advance\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes runs certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nRepublican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least have to vote no against uh on on uh on on the debate Jeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes\nUp put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there is at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote\nWhen the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what\nWhat evidence do we have to go on to the way she's leaving\nWell look like you lay out here everyone's watching this court pet you know the final four voters are and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nIs she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of Betsy device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot pensions [laughter] there's your health committee yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns about how ... how much she would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a colon and for or against um [noise] the boss and wound up forcing\nMy pen to come and break the tie\nTwo thousand eight when Dick Cheney has to come down and break the tie on a package of tax\nJust a reminder the devoted to vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and your mood choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... is executive vice president for policy at the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination Muslims just\nWant to come on and so what are you thinking about this book\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's\nBipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct\nAnd I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nIt's it's not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican or out of fifty one who\nVoted no this has been a very very partisan vote into those equally part of the Democratic side is enough\n[noise] [noise] well I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against\nVoting on against cloture voting to end debate\nIs a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nA usually people uh want to at least allow the vote for a seat or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote it sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote\nBut I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's procedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg\nSo you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handle but Christine blog the four letter in early July [noise] um and I\nYou you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which ah Christine shifts both [laughter] so ... ...\n... and and Dianne Feinstein said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone\nIt it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public\nAnd I think Senator Feinstein honors her wishes and I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really\nIs when you were a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story\nIf ever you decide to tell your story ... I'm\nThinking about that was it impossible for her to tip off the FBI to mention it to someone so there can be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island or to the chairman staff and the chairman staff\nReleased the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\n... you know share it with other members and still preserve confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as that or if I'm really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept\nFeinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another\nLawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who ah have possession of a letter we don't know who else might have been told and in what way but in the end it leaked do you believe it all to mostly had to lick was\nThere an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated I'm Better at an individual who didn't want to go on the record\nI don't know who leaked it but I think that\nWhat this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week is there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly confessed to a senator they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women have experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that\nChristine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter at a campaign rally\nSent exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nLet me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic\nWho wrote a long article of touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teams\nBut said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously in investigating these kinds of allegations of difference between the broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here\nHas there been some confusion of one with the other on this issue people who are concerned about the broader issue have assumed that Kavanaugh must be guilty because they're concerned about the issue or the reverse for them that\nWell first I Would say this is not about his guilt or not killed this is a job interview and Republicans prevented any corroborating or supporting witnesses from being hurt by the committee and then Republicans prevented the FBI\nFrom reaching out to people who would support Christine Blasey Ford's account or Debbie Ramirez is account\nSo I find it really troubling that\nEven though it is not a criminal trial the standard should certainly not be proof beyond a reasonable doubt but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "05"}
