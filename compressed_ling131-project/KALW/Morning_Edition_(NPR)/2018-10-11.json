because after a dramatic fell off yesterday stock prices had the worst drop since February with the Dow Jones industrial average losing more than three percent\nOf its value and that's still a ripple through international market today with stocks falling across Asia and also across Europe let's bring in NPR's Jim Zarroli who's in New York either Jim Hi David so how are the markets looking at the moment\nYeah it looks like another volatile day I mean we had a brief period where stocks were positive right after they open but now they're dropping again I've it continues this will be the six straight de ... five hundred is down um you know we would seems like the ... the mood in the market has really changed investors are trying to come to grips with with some of the big issues on the table\nYeah what what what has changed what investors coming to grips with well\nOne of the important things as interest rates the fed has been raising rates for a while now you have the central banks in Europe and Japan doing it as well uh when that happens it makes borrowing more expensive but it also when rates go up a bonds become more attractive so people take\nMoney out of stocks and put it in bonds also this continuing trade tensions with China that that's certainly a factor um you know we have this new agreement with Matt Canada and Mexico but it doesn't even really looked like the like we're talking with China so I think invest a lot of American companies do business in China\nAnd will be affected by that um how badly we they are affected we should see in the next few weeks because this is the time of year when the companies begin to say how they did in the third quarter so we will learn more but right now\nRight now I think a lot of investors are just nervous they're seeing what's happening with our with trade with China and that's being reflected in the markets\nYou know when when um the stocks are doing well President Trump likes to point to it to some sort of indication of the economy ... what does this say or not say about the state of the economy\nWhile the stock market is not the economy so you can have turbulence in the market even when the overall economy is doing well which certainly is the message the president wants to\nSandy put out of state and yesterday after that big sell off saying the fundamentals of the economy are quote incredibly strong however it's important to remember you know stock stock market investors are always looking ahead so they can think that conditions are good right now but but\nYou know ... not be so sure about the future and clearly the markets are worried about interest rates in trade and the president is worried too because he\nAgain yesterday criticized the fed for raising interest rates you said I think that the fed has gone crazy or Larry Kudlow who directs the national economic council tried to walk back some of the criticism today on on CNBC but the president clearly doesn't like what the fed is doing\nAll right NPR's Jim Zarroli giving a bit of it on the ducks and some of the context for the drop that we're seeing out here in New York and think oh You're welcome ...\nGerman Chancellor Angela
