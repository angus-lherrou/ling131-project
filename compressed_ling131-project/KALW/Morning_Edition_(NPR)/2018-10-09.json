France was a man named among Hong way he's from China\nBut in a stunning move China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol I talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about my well among\nHallway is sixty four years old he served as the vice ministry of public security bureau which is China's national police are twenty sixteen he\nBecame the first Chinese head of Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate in extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt would escape China\nBut as it turns out among himself is hell under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWhich are the government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how his attention unfolded has come from his wife grace among September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by a ... nice to just in that she was in danger\nA week later she reported missing to French police on Sunday\nOrdered and here's what she said we had to go and you know what I'm speaking on behalf of my children on them for my mother and all the wives\nAnd children husbands and fathers so they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police well when she\nTalks about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by Xi Jinping immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and it's aired hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julia ... conga highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing month from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for ...\nWell even before this happened China's use of Interpol and amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempted to issue a red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists were years are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy\nPolitics is spilling over into international organizations really interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this is in an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff Jeff standard likes that system he's in Lewiston in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on so there are steps are going to be half of World War taking and their belts are going to be chained together so you're walking on the line it's kind of like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nNow we can take 'em right in the back and put 'em in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera\nConversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davidson says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em up because of uh watching everybody get up and go in front of the screen and it's either yes or a nose or you know you couldn't Sunni\nTo Davidson says when you're in this\nAnd he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh should explain to the judge what happened\nAnd they told me to be quite\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\n[noise] layer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that it alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nBefore the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process\nYou are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\n... year after Harvey Weinstein and me to New

began\nYou already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process\nYou are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going\nUnless my clients and shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may
